        "abstract": "The well-orchestrated multicellular life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum has fascinated biologists for over a century. Self-organisation of its amoebas into aggregates, migrating slugs and fruiting structures by pulsatile cAMP signalling and their ability to follow separate differentiation pathways in well-regulated proportions continue to be topics under investigation. A striking aspect of D. discoideum development is the recurrent use of cAMP as chemoattractant, differentiation inducing signal and second messenger for other signals that control the developmental programme. D. discoideum is one of >150 species of Dictyostelia and aggregative life styles similar to those of Dictyostelia evolved many times in eukaryotes. Here we review experimental studies investigating how phenotypic complexity and cAMP signalling co-evolved in Dictyostelia. In addition, we summarize comparative genomic studies of multicellular Dictyostelia and unicellular Amoebozoa aimed to identify evolutionary conservation and change in all genes known to be essential for D. discoideum development.",

The use of this slime mould is possible owing to similarities in cell structure, behaviour and intracellular signalling with mammalian cells. Its haploid set of chromosomes completely sequenced amenable to genetic manipulation, its unique and short life cycle with unicellular and multicellular stages, and phenotypic richness encoding many human orthologues, make Dictyostelium a representative and simple model organism to unveil cellular processes in human disease. Dictyostelium studies within the biomedical field have provided fundamental knowledge in the areas of bacterial infection, immune cell chemotaxis, autophagy/phagocytosis and mitochondrial and neurological disorders. Consequently, Dictyostelium has been used to the development of related pharmacological treatments. Herein, we review the utilization of Dictyostelium as a model organism in biomedicine.",

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a tractable model organism to study cellular allorecognition, which is the ability of a cell to distinguish itself and its genetically similar relatives from more distantly related organisms. Cellular allorecognition is ubiquitous across the tree of life and affects many biological processes. Depending on the biological context, these versatile systems operate both within and between individual organisms, and both promote and constrain functional heterogeneity. Some of the most notable allorecognition systems mediate neural self-avoidance in flies and adaptive immunity in vertebrates. D. discoideum's allorecognition system shares several structures and functions with other allorecognition systems. Structurally, its key regulators reside at a single genomic locus that encodes two highly polymorphic proteins, a transmembrane ligand called TgrC1 and its receptor TgrB1. These proteins exhibit isoform-specific, heterophilic binding across cells. Functionally, this interaction determines the extent to which co-developing D. discoideum strains co-aggregate or segregate during the aggregation phase of multicellular development. The allorecognition system thus affects both development and social evolution, as available evidence suggests that the threat of developmental cheating represents a primary selective force acting on it. Other significant characteristics that may inform the study of allorecognition in general include that D. discoideum's allorecognition system is a continuous and inclusive trait, it is pleiotropic, and it is temporally regulated.",

        "abstract": "Macropinocytosis-the large-scale, non-specific uptake of fluid by cells-is used by Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae to obtain nutrients. These cells form circular ruffles around regions of membrane defined by a patch of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and the activated forms of the small G-proteins Ras and Rac. When this ruffle closes, a vesicle of the medium is delivered to the cell interior for further processing. It is accepted that PIP3 is required for efficient macropinocytosis. Here, we assess the roles of Ras and Rac in Dictyostelium macropinocytosis. Gain-of-function experiments show that macropinocytosis is stimulated by persistent Ras activation and genetic analysis suggests that RasG and RasS are the key Ras proteins involved. Among the activating guanine exchange factors (GEFs), GefF is implicated in macropinocytosis by an insertional mutant. The individual roles of Rho family proteins are little understood but activation of at least some may be independent of PIP3.

The function of this protein and the molecular mechanisms underlying its toxicity are still unclear, but many studies have suggested that the mechanism of \u03b1-synuclein toxicity involves alterations to mitochondrial function. Here we expressed human \u03b1-synuclein and two PD-causing \u03b1-synuclein mutant proteins (with a point mutation, A53T, and a C-terminal 20 amino acid truncation) in the eukaryotic model <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Mitochondrial disease has been well studied in <i>D. discoideum</i> and, unlike in mammals, mitochondrial dysfunction results in a clear set of defective phenotypes. These defective phenotypes are caused by the chronic hyperactivation of the cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Expression of \u03b1-synuclein wild type and mutant forms was toxic to the cells and mitochondrial function was dysregulated. Some but not all of the defective phenotypes could be rescued by down regulation of AMPK revealing both AMPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Importantly, we also show that the C-terminus of \u03b1-synuclein is required and sufficient for the localisation of the protein to the cell cortex in <i>D. discoideum</i>.",

        "abstract": "In Metazoa, a polarized epithelium forms a single-cell-layered barrier that separates the outside from the inside of the organism. In tubular epithelia, the apical side of the cell is constricted relative to the basal side, forming a wedge-shaped cell that can pack into a tube. Apical constriction is mediated by actomyosin activity. In higher animals, apical actomyosin is connected between cells by specialized cell-cell junctions that contain a classical cadherin, the Wnt signaling protein \u03b2-catenin, and the actin-binding protein \u03b1-catenin. The molecular mechanisms that lead to selective accumulation of myosin at the apical surface of cells are poorly understood. We found that the nonmetazoan Dictyostelium discoideum forms a polarized epithelium that surrounds the stalk tube at the tip of the multicellular fruiting body. Although D. discoideum lacks a cadherin homolog, it expresses homologs of \u03b2- and \u03b1-catenin. Both catenins are essential for formation of the tip epithelium, polarized protein secretion, and proper multicellular morphogenesis. Myosin localizes apically in tip epithelial cells, and it appears that constriction of this epithelial tube is required for proper morphogenesis. Localization of myosin II is controlled by the protein IQGAP1 and its binding partners cortexillins I and II, which function downstream of \u03b1- and \u03b2-catenin to exclude myosin from the basolateral cortex and promote apical accumulation of myosin. These studies show that the function of catenins in cell polarity predates the evolution of Wnt signaling and classical cadherins, and that apical localization of myosin is a morphogenetic mechanism conserved from nonmetazoans to vertebrates.",

Here, we investigate the physiological effects and molecular targets of curcumin in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> We show that curcumin exerts acute effects on cell behaviour, reduces cell growth and slows multicellular development. We employed a range of structurally related compounds to show the distinct role of different structural groups in curcumin's effects on cell behaviour, growth and development, highlighting active moieties in cell function, and showing that these cellular effects are unrelated to the well-known antioxidant activity of curcumin. Molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of curcumin and one synthetic analogue (EF24) were then investigated to identify a curcumin-resistant mutant lacking the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit (PsrA) and an EF24-resistant mutant lacking the presenilin 1 orthologue (PsenB). Using <i>in silico</i> docking analysis, we then showed that curcumin might function through direct binding to a key regulatory region of PsrA.

During aggregation it produces and relays a chemical signal (cAMP) which shows spirals and target centers. Nevertheless, the natural emergence of these structures is still not well understood. We present a mechanism for creation of centers and target waves of cAMP in D.d. by adding cell inhomogeneity to a well known reaction-diffusion model of cAMP waves and we characterize its properties. We show how stable activity centers appear spontaneously in areas of higher cell density with the oscillation frequency of these centers depending on their density. The cAMP waves have the characteristic dispersion relation of trigger waves and a velocity which increases with cell density. Chemotactically competent cells react to these waves and create aggregation streams even with very simple movement rules. Finally we argue in favor of the existence of bounded phosphodiesterase to maintain the wave properties once small cell clusters appear.",

Cells sense extracellular cAMP and produce internal caches of cAMP to be released, relaying the signal. These events lead to traveling waves of cAMP washing over the population of cells. While much research has been performed to understand the functioning of the chemotaxis network in D. discoideum, limited work has been done to link the operation of the signal relay network with the chemotaxis network to provide a holistic view of the system. We take inspiration from D. discoideum and propose a model that directly links the relaying of a chemical message to the directional sensing of that signal. Utilizing an excitable dynamical systems model that has been previously validated experimentally, we show that it is possible to have both signal amplification and perfect adaptation in a single module. We show that noise plays a vital role in chemotaxing to static gradients, where stochastic tunneling of transient bursts biases the system towards accurate gradient sensing. Moreover, this model also automatically matches its internal time scale of adaptation to the naturally occurring periodicity of the traveling chemical waves generated in the population. Numerical simulations were performed to study the qualitative phenomenology of the system and explore how the system responds to diverse dynamic spatiotemporal stimuli. Finally, we address dynamical instabilities that impede chemotactic ability in a continuum version of the model.",

Here we focus on recent results revealing how Dictyostelium discoideum senses and kills non-pathogenic bacteria. In this model, genetic analysis of intracellular killing of bacteria has revealed a surprisingly complex array of specialized mechanisms. These results raise new questions on these processes, and challenge current models based largely on studies in mammalian phagocytes. In addition, recent studies suggest one additional level on complexity by revealing how Dictyostelium recognizes specifically various bacterial species and strains, and adapts its metabolism to process them. It remains to be seen to what extent mechanisms uncovered in Dictyostelium are also used in mammalian phagocytic cells.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum (D.\u00a0discoideum) is a simple eukaryote with a unique life cycle in which it differentiates from unicellular amoebae into a fruiting body upon starvation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated with bacterial predation, as well as regulatory events during D.\u00a0discoideum development and differentiation. Coenzyme A (CoA) is a key metabolic integrator in all living cells. A novel function of CoA in redox regulation, mediated by covalent attachment of CoA to cellular proteins in response to oxidative or metabolic stress, has been recently discovered and termed protein CoAlation. In this study, we report that the level of CoA and protein CoAlation in D.\u00a0discoideum are developmentally regulated, and correlate with the temporal expression pattern of genes implicated in CoA biosynthesis during morphogenesis. Furthermore, treatment of growing D.\u00a0discoideum cells with oxidising agents results in a dose-dependent increase of protein CoAlation. However, much higher concentrations were required when compared to mammalian cells and bacteria. Increased resistance of D.\u00a0discoideum to oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has previously been attributed to high levels of catalase activity. In support of this notion, we found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced protein CoAlation is significantly increased in CatA-deficient D.\u00a0discoideum cells. Collectively, this study provides insights into the role of CoA and protein CoAlation in the maintenance of redox homeostasis in amoeba and during D.\u00a0discoideum morphogenesis.",

Here, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling has been combined to identify novel early developmentally regulated proteins in eukaryote cells. These proteomic and transcriptomic experiments were performed in Dictyostelium discoideum given the unique advantages that this organism offers as a eukaryotic model for cell motility and as a nonmammalian model of human disease. By comparing whole-cell proteome analysis of developed (cAMP-pulsed) wild-type AX2 cells and an independent transcriptomic analysis of developed wild-type AX4 cells, our results show that up to 70% of the identified proteins overlap in the two independent studies. Among them, we have found 26 proteins previously related to cAMP signaling and identified 110 novel proteins involved in calcium signaling, adhesion, actin cytoskeleton, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, metabolism, and proteins that previously lacked any annotation. Our study validates previous findings, mostly for the canonical cAMP-pathway, and also generates further insight into the complexity of the transcriptomic changes during early development. This article also compares proteomic data between parental and cells lacking glkA, a GSK-3 kinase implicated in substrate adhesion and chemotaxis in Dictyostelium. This analysis reveals a set of proteins that show differences in expression in the two strains as well as overlapping protein level changes independent of GlkA.",

To try to understand these mechanisms, we have been using a combination of modelling and experiments to study the simple system Dictyostelium discoideum, which forms approximately 20000 cell groups. We found that cells secrete a factor, and as the number of cells increases, the concentration of the factor increases. Diffusion calculations indicated that this lets cells sense the local cell density. Computer simulations predicted, and experiments then showed, that this factor decreases cell-cell adhesion and increases random cell motility. In a group, adhesion forces keep cells together, while random motility forces cause cells to pull apart and separate from each other. As the group size increases above a threshold, the factor concentration goes above a threshold and the cells switch from an adhered state to a separated state. This causes excessively large groups to break apart and/or dissipate, creating an upper limit to group size. In this review, we focus on how computer simulations made testable predictions that led the way to understanding the size regulation mechanism mediated by this factor.",

        "abstract": "Cytokinins (CKs) are a family of evolutionarily conserved growth regulating hormones. While CKs are well-characterized in plant systems, these <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-substituted adenine derivatives are found in a variety of organisms beyond plants, including bacteria, fungi, mammals, and the social amoeba, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Within <i>Dictyostelium</i>, CKs have only been studied in the late developmental stages of the life cycle, where they promote spore encapsulation and dormancy. In this study, we used ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionization-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-(ESI+)-HRMS/MS) to profile CKs during the <i>Dictyostelium</i> life cycle: growth, aggregation, mound, slug, fruiting body, and germination. Comprehensive profiling revealed that <i>Dictyostelium</i> produces 6 CK forms (<i>cis</i>-Zeatin (<i>c</i>Z), discadenine (DA), <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-isopentenyladenine (iP), <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-isopentenyladenine-9-riboside (iPR), <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-isopentenyladenine-9-riboside-5' phosphate (iPRP), and 2-methylthio-<i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-isopentenyladenine (2MeSiP)) in varying abundance across the sampled life cycle stages, thus laying the foundation for the CK biosynthesis pathway to be defined in this organism. Interestingly, iP-type CKs were the most dominant CK analytes detected during growth and aggregation. Exogenous treatment of AX3 cells with various CK types revealed that iP was the only CK to promote the proliferation of cells in culture. In support of previous studies, metabolomics data revealed that DA is one of the most significantly upregulated small molecules during <i>Dictyostelium</i> development, and our data indicates that total CK levels are highest during germination. While much remains to be explored in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, this research offers new insight into the nature of CK biosynthesis, secretion, and function during <i>Dictyostelium</i> growth, development, and spore germination.",

        "abstract": "Many protein-misfolding diseases are caused by proteins carrying prion-like domains. These proteins show sequence similarity to yeast prion proteins, which can interconvert between an intrinsically disordered and an aggregated prion state. The natural presence of prions in yeast has provided important insight into disease mechanisms and cellular proteostasis. However, little is known about prions in other organisms, and it is not yet clear whether the findings in yeast can be generalized. Using bioinformatics tools, we show that Dictyostelium discoideum has the highest content of prion-like proteins of all organisms investigated to date, suggesting that its proteome has a high overall aggregation propensity. To study mechanisms regulating these proteins, we analyze the behavior of several well-characterized prion-like proteins, such as an expanded version of human huntingtin exon 1 (Q103) and the prion domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35 (NM), in D. discoideum. We find that these proteins remain soluble and are innocuous to D. discoideum, in contrast to other organisms, where they form cytotoxic cytosolic aggregates. However, when exposed to conditions that compromise molecular chaperones, these proteins aggregate and become cytotoxic. We show that the disaggregase Hsp101, a molecular chaperone of the Hsp100 family, dissolves heat-induced aggregates and promotes thermotolerance. Furthermore, prion-like proteins accumulate in the nucleus, where they are targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our data suggest that D. discoideum has undergone specific adaptations that increase the proteostatic capacity of this organism and allow for an efficient regulation of its prion-like proteome.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is an intriguing model organism for the study of cell differentiation processes during development, cell signaling, and other important cellular biology questions. The technologies available to genetically manipulate Dictyostelium cells are well-developed. Transfections can be performed using different selectable markers and marker re-cycling, including homologous recombination and insertional mutagenesis. This is supported by a well-annotated genome. However, these approaches are optimized for axenic cell lines growing in liquid cultures and are difficult to apply to non-axenic wild-type cells, which feed only on bacteria. The mutations that are present in axenic strains disturb Ras signaling, causing excessive macropinocytosis required for feeding, and impair cell migration, which confounds the interpretation of signal transduction and chemotaxis experiments in those strains. Earlier attempts to genetically manipulate non-axenic cells have lacked efficiency and required complex experimental procedures. We have developed a simple transfection protocol that, for the first time, overcomes these limitations. Those series of large improvements to Dictyostelium molecular genetics allow wild-type cells to be manipulated as easily as standard laboratory strains. In addition to the advantages for studying uncorrupted signaling and motility processes, mutants that disrupt macropinocytosis-based growth can now be readily isolated. Furthermore, the entire transfection workflow is greatly accelerated, with recombinant cells that can be generated in days rather than weeks. Another advantage is that molecular genetics can further be performed with freshly isolated wild-type Dictyostelium samples from the environment. This can help to extend the scope of approaches used in these research areas.",

        "abstract": "Iron, zinc, and copper play fundamental roles in eucaryotes and procaryotes, and their bioavailability regulates host-pathogen interactions. For intracellular pathogens, the source of metals is the cytoplasm of the host, which in turn manipulates intracellular metal traffic following pathogen recognition. It is established that iron is withheld from the pathogen-containing vacuole, whereas for copper and zinc the evidence is unclear. Most infection studies in mammals have concentrated on effects of metal deficiency/overloading at organismal level. Thus, zinc deficiency or supplementation correlate with high risk of respiratory tract infection or recovery from severe infection, respectively. Iron, zinc, and copper deficiency or overload affects lymphocyte proliferation/maturation, and thus the adaptive immune response. Whether they regulate innate immunity at macrophage level is open, except for iron. The early identification in a mouse mutant susceptible to mycobacterial infection of the iron transporter Nramp1 allowed dissecting Nramp1 role in phagocytes, from the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i> to macrophages. Nramp1 regulates iron efflux from the phagosomes, thus starving pathogenic bacteria for iron. Similar studies for zinc or copper are scant, due to the large number of copper and zinc transporters. In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, zinc and copper transporters include 11 and 6 members, respectively. To assess the role of zinc or copper in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, cells were grown under conditions of metal depletion or excess and tested for resistance to <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> infection. Iron shortage or overload inhibited <i>Dictyostelium</i> cell growth within few generations. Surprisingly, zinc or copper depletion failed to affect growth. Zinc or copper overloading inhibited cell growth at, respectively, 50- or 500-fold the physiological concentration, suggesting very efficient control of their homeostasis, as confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry quantification of cellular metals. <i>Legionella</i> infection was inhibited or enhanced in cells grown under iron shortage or overload, respectively, confirming a major role for iron in controlling resistance to pathogens. In contrast, zinc and copper depletion or excess during growth did not affect <i>Legionella</i> infection. Using Zinpyr-1 as fluorescent sensor, we show that zinc accumulates in endo-lysosomal vesicles, including phagosomes, and the contractile vacuole. Furthermore, we provide evidence for permeabilization of the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole during bacterial proliferation.",

Its ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is encoded in an extrachromosomal palindrome that exists in \u223c100 copies in the cell. In this study, we have set out to investigate the sequence of the expressed rRNA. For this, we have ligated the rRNA ends and performed RT-PCR on these circular RNAs. Sequencing revealed that the mature 26 S, 17 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S rRNAs have sizes of 3741, 1871, 162, and 112 nucleotides, respectively. Unlike the published data, all mature rRNAs of the same type uniformly display the same start and end nucleotides in the analyzed AX2 strain. We show the existence of a short lived primary transcript covering the rRNA transcription unit of 17 S, 5.8 S, and 26 S rRNA. Northern blots and RT-PCR reveal that from this primary transcript two precursor molecules of the 17 S and two precursors of the 26 S rRNA are generated. We have also determined the sequences of these precursor molecules, and based on these data, we propose a model for the maturation of the rRNAs in Dictyostelium discoideum that we compare with the processing of the rRNA transcription unit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

        "abstract": "Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are ubiquitous phosphotransfer enzymes responsible for producing most of the nucleoside triphosphates except for ATP. This role is important for the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins and the metabolism of sugars and lipids. Apart from this housekeeping role NDPKs have been shown to have many regulatory functions in diverse cellular processes including proliferation and endocytosis. Although the protein has been shown to have a positive regulatory role in clathrin- and dynamin-mediated micropinocytosis, its roles in macropinocytosis and phagocytosis have not been studied. The additional non-housekeeping roles of NDPK are often independent of enzyme activity but dependent on the expression level of the protein. In this study we altered the expression level of NDPK in the model eukaryotic organism Dictyostelium discoideum through antisense inhibition and overexpression. We demonstrate that NDPK levels affect growth, endocytosis and exocytosis. In particular we find that Dictyostelium NDPK negatively regulates endocytosis in contrast to the positive regulatory role identified in higher eukaryotes. This can be explained by the differences in types of endocytosis that have been studied in the different systems - phagocytosis and macropinocytosis in Dictyostelium compared with micropinocytosis in mammalian cells. This is the first report of a role for NDPK in regulating macropinocytosis and phagocytosis, the former being the major fluid phase uptake mechanism for macrophages, dendritic cells and other (non dendritic) cells exposed to growth factors.",

They do it by preventing initiation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pulses. Furthermore, these compounds stimulate adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of a 41 kDa cytosolic protein and regulate the glyceraldehyde-3-phospate dehydrogenase activity. Yet, although D. discoideum cells produce NO at a relatively constant rate at the onset of their developmental cycle, there is still no evidence of the presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. In this work, we detect the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity in D. discoideum and we characterise it by specific inhibitors and physical-chemical conditions that allegedly distinguish between NOS-related and -unrelated NADPH-d activity.",

Autocrine proliferation repressor protein A (AprA) is a protein secreted by the eukaryotic microbe <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> AprA is a chemorepellent for and inhibits the proliferation of <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> We previously found that cells sense AprA using G proteins, suggesting the existence of a G protein-coupled AprA receptor. To identify the AprA receptor, we screened mutants lacking putative G protein-coupled receptors. We found that, compared to the wild-type strain, cells lacking putative receptor GrlH (<i>grlH\u00af</i> cells) show rapid proliferation, do not have large numbers of cells moving away from the edges of colonies, are insensitive to AprA-induced proliferation inhibition and chemorepulsion, and have decreased AprA binding.

In addition, little is known about how eukaryotic cells can sense a repellant signal and move away from the source of the repellant, for instance, to organize the movement of cells in a developing embryo or to move immune cells out of a tissue.

Originally, the chlorinated alkylphenone differentiation-inducing factors (DIFs) -1 and -3 were isolated as stalk cell inducers in <i>D. discoideum</i>. Later, DIFs and their derivatives were shown to possess several biologic activities including antitumor and anti-<i>Trypanosoma</i> properties. In this study, we examined the antibacterial activities of approximately 30 DIF derivatives by using several bacterial species. Several of the DIF derivatives strongly suppressed the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the sub-micromolar to low-micromolar range. In contrast, none of the DIF derivatives evaluated had any noteworthy effect on the growth of the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> (MIC, >100 \u00b5M). Most importantly, several of the DIF derivatives strongly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> and vancomycin-resistant <i>E. faecalis</i> and <i>E. faecium</i>. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that treatment with DIF derivatives led to the formation of distinct multilayered structures consisting of cell wall or plasma membrane in <i>S. aureus</i>.

We investigated whether this relationship extends to a plant-parasitic nematode that is active in the rhizosphere and has broad host specificity, damaging crops worldwide. Using a novel assay to examine the interaction between the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, and the plant-parasitic nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., we found that cellular slime molds can repel plant parasitic nematodes. Specifically, the repulsion activity was in response to chemical compounds released by cellular slime mold fruiting bodies. Under laboratory conditions, these soluble chemical extracts from fruiting bodies of D. discoideum showed repulsion activity strong enough to protect plant roots. The fruiting body cell extracts repelled but were not toxic to the plant-parasitic nematodes.",

        "abstract": "Due to their archaic life style and microbivor behavior, amoebae may represent a source of antimicrobial peptides and proteins. The amoebic protozoon <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> has been a model organism in cell biology for decades and has recently also been used for research on host-pathogen interactions and the evolution of innate immunity. In the genome of <i>D. discoideum</i>, genes can be identified that potentially allow the synthesis of a variety of antimicrobial proteins. However, at the protein level only very few antimicrobial proteins have been characterized that may interact directly with bacteria and help in fighting infection of <i>D. discoideum</i> with potential pathogens. Here, we focus on a large group of gene products that structurally belong to the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family and which members we named provisionally Apls (amoebapore-like peptides) according to their similarity to a comprehensively studied antimicrobial and cytotoxic pore-forming protein of the protozoan parasite <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>. We focused on AplD because it is the only Apl gene that is reported to be primarily transcribed further during the multicellular stages such as the mobile slug stage. Upon knock-out (KO) of the gene, <i>aplD</i><sup>-</sup> slugs became highly vulnerable to virulent <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. <i>AplD</i><sup>-</sup> slugs harbored bacterial clumps in their interior and were unable to slough off the pathogen in their slime sheath. Re-expression of AplD in <i>aplD</i><sup>-</sup> slugs rescued the susceptibility toward <i>K. pneumoniae</i>. The purified recombinant protein rAplD formed pores in liposomes and was also capable of permeabilizing the membrane of live <i>Bacillus megaterium</i>. We propose that the multifarious Apl family of <i>D. discoideum</i> comprises antimicrobial effector polypeptides that are instrumental to interact with bacteria and their phospholipid membranes. The variety of its members would allow a complementary and synergistic action against a variety of microbes, which the amoeba encounters in its environment.",

The PAM requirement is limitation for precise genome editing such as single amino-acid substitutions and knock-ins at specific genomic loci since it occurs in narrow editing window. Recently, SpCas9 variants (i.e., xCas9 3.7, SpCas9-NG, and SpRY) were developed that recognise the NG dinucleotide or almost any other PAM sequences in human cell lines. In this study, we evaluated these variants in Dictyostelium discoideum. In the context of targeted mutagenesis at an NG PAM site, we found that SpCas9-NG and SpRY were more efficient than xCas9 3.7. In the context of NA, NT, NG, and NC PAM sites, the editing efficiency of SpRY was approximately 60% at NR (R\u2009=\u2009A and G) but less than 22% at NY (Y\u2009=\u2009T and C). We successfully used SpRY to generate knock-ins at specific gene loci using donor DNA flanked by 60 bp homology arms. In addition, we achieved point mutations with efficiencies as high as 97.7%. This work provides tools that will significantly expand the gene loci that can be targeted for knock-out, knock-in, and precise point mutation in D. discoideum.",

        "abstract": "When starved, the amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum initiate a developmental process that results in the formation of fruiting bodies in which stalks support balls of spores. The nutrients and energy necessary for development are provided by autophagy. Atg1 is a protein kinase that regulates the induction of autophagy in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to a conserved kinase domain, Dictyostelium Atg1 has a C-terminal region that has significant homology to the Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian Atg1 homologues but not to the budding yeast Atg1. We investigated the function of the kinase and conserved C-terminal domains of D. discoideum Atg1 (DdAtg1) and showed that these domains are essential for autophagy and development. Kinase-negative DdAtg1 acts in a dominant-negative fashion, resulting in a mutant phenotype when expressed in the wild-type cells. Green fluorescent protein-tagged kinase-negative DdAtg1 colocalizes with red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged DdAtg8, a marker of preautophagosomal structures and autophagosomes. The conserved C-terminal region is essential for localization of kinase-negative DdAtg1 to autophagosomes labeled with RFP-tagged Dictyostelium Atg8. The dominant-negative effect of the kinase-defective mutant also depends on the C-terminal domain. In cells expressing dominant-negative DdAtg1, autophagosomes are formed and accumulate but seem not to be functional. By using a temperature-sensitive DdAtg1, we showed that DdAtg1 is required throughout development; development halts when the cells are shifted to the restrictive temperature, but resumes when cells are returned to the permissive temperature.",

Here, we describe a CRISPR-based test for gene essentiality (CRISPR-E test) that allows the identification of essential genes. Specifically, we use sgRNA-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 to target the open reading frame of a gene in the genome and analyze the in-frame (3n) and frameshift (3n\u2009+\u20091 and 3n\u2009+\u20092) mutations in the targeted region of the gene in surviving cells. If the gene is non-essential, the cells would carry both in-frame (3n) and frameshift (3n\u2009+\u20091 and 3n\u2009+\u20092) mutations. In contrast, the cells would carry only in-frame (3n) mutations if the targeted gene is essential, and this selective elimination of frameshift (3n\u2009+\u20091 and 3n\u2009+\u20092) mutations of the gene indicate its essentiality. As a proof of concept, we have used this CRISPR-E test in the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum to demonstrate that Dync1li1 is an essential gene while KIF1A and fAR1 are not. We further propose a simple method for quantifying the essentiality of a gene using the CRISPR-E test.",

Using mutants that grow poorly on Gram-negative bacteria but grow well on Gram-positive bacteria, we show that growth depends on cell-density and on prey type. We also found synergy, by showing that pairwise mixes of different mutants grow well on live Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, wild-type amoebae produce diffusible factors that facilitate mutant growth and some mutants exploit the wild type in mixed cultures.

        "abstract": "The slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum's</i> life cycle includes different unicellular and multicellular stages that provide a convenient model for research concerning intracellular and intercellular mechanisms influencing mitochondria's structure and function. We aim to determine the differences between the mitochondria isolated from the slime mold regarding its early developmental stages induced by starvation, namely the unicellular (U), aggregation (A) and streams (S) stages, at the bioenergetic and proteome levels. We measured the oxygen consumption of intact cells using the Clarke electrode and observed a distinct decrease in mitochondrial coupling capacity for stage S cells and a decrease in mitochondrial coupling efficiency for stage A and S cells. We also found changes in spare respiratory capacity. We performed a wide comparative proteomic study. During the transition from the unicellular stage to the multicellular stage, important proteomic differences occurred in stages A and S relating to the proteins of the main mitochondrial functional groups, showing characteristic tendencies that could be associated with their ongoing adaptation to starvation following cell reprogramming during the switch to gluconeogenesis. We suggest that the main mitochondrial processes are downregulated during the early developmental stages, although this needs to be verified by extending analogous studies to the next slime mold life cycle stages.",

Transcript levels are low during growth and vary during development, reaching high levels during the aggregation and late developmental stages. The Arabidopsis ortholog was described as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for abscisic acid present at the plasma membrane, whereas the mammalian ortholog is a Golgi apparatus-associated anion channel functioning as a Golgi apparatus pH regulator. To probe its role in D. discoideum, we generated a strain lacking GPHR. The mutant had different growth characteristics than the AX2 parent strain, exhibited changes during late development, and formed abnormally shaped small slugs and fruiting bodies. An analysis of development-specific markers revealed that their expression was disturbed. The distributions of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus were unaltered at the immunofluorescence level. Likewise, their functions did not appear to be impaired, since membrane proteins were properly processed and glycosylated. Also, changes in the external pH were sensed by the ER, as indicated by a pH-sensitive ER probe, as in the wild type.",

Since directed migration is essential for normal D. discoideum multicellular development, mutants with chemotactic impairments are likely to have abnormal developmental morphologies. We have used multicellular development as a readout in a screen of mutants to identify new potential regulators of chemotaxis. In this chapter, we describe how mutants generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) are analyzed, from assessment of development to detailed characterization of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced responses. Two complementary approaches, plating cells either clonally on a bacterial lawn or as a population on non-nutrient agar, are used to evaluate multicellular development. Once mutants with aberrant developmental phenotypes are identified, their chemotaxis toward cAMP is assessed by both small population and micropipette assays. Furthermore, mutants are tested for defects in both general and specific signaling pathways by examining the recruitment of actin-binding LimE(\u0394coil) or PIP3-binding PH domains to the plasma membrane in response to cAMP stimulation.",

        "abstract": "Ingestion and killing of bacteria by phagocytic cells protect the human body against infections. While many mechanisms have been proposed to account for bacterial killing in phagosomes, their relative importance, redundancy, and specificity remain unclear. In this study, we used the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> amoeba as a model phagocyte and quantified the requirement of 11 individual gene products, including nine putative effectors, for the killing of bacteria. This analysis revealed that radically different mechanisms are required to kill <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> AlyL, a lysozyme-like protein equipped with a distinct bacteriolytic region, plays a specific role in the intracellular killing of <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, with assistance from BpiC and Aoah, two lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding proteins. Rapid killing of <i>E. coli</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> requires the presence of BpiC and of the NoxA NADPH oxidase. No single effector tested is essential for rapid killing of <i>S. aureus</i> or <i>B. subtilis</i> Overall, our observations reveal an unsuspected degree of specificity in the elimination of bacteria in phagosomes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Phagocytic cells ingest and kill bacteria, a process essential for the defense of the human body against infections. Many potential killing mechanisms have been identified in phagocytic cells, including free radicals, toxic ions, enzymes, and permeabilizing peptides. Yet fundamental questions remain unanswered: what is the relative importance of these mechanisms, how redundant are they, and are different mechanisms used to kill different species of bacteria? We addressed these questions using <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, a model phagocytic cell amenable to genetic manipulations and quantitative analysis. Our results reveal that vastly different mechanisms are required to kill different species of bacteria. This very high degree of specificity was unexpected and indicates that a lot remains to be discovered about how phagocytic cells eliminate bacteria.",

        "abstract": "The study of spontaneous mutation rates has revealed a wide range of heritable point mutation rates across species, but there are comparatively few estimates for large-scale deletion and duplication rates. The handful of studies that have directly calculated spontaneous rates of deletion and duplication using mutation accumulation lines have estimated that genes are duplicated and deleted at orders of magnitude greater rates than the spontaneous point mutation rate. In our study, we tested whether spontaneous gene deletion and gene duplication rates are also high in Dictyostelium discoideum, a eukaryote with among the lowest point mutation rates (2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-11</sup> per site per generation) and an AT-rich genome (GC content of 22%). We calculated mutation rates of gene deletions and duplications using whole-genome sequencing data originating from a mutation accumulation experiment and determined the association between the copy number mutations and GC content. Overall, we estimated an average of 3.93\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup> gene deletions and 1.18\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup> gene duplications per gene per generation. While orders of magnitude greater than their point mutation rate, these rates are much lower compared to gene deletion and duplication rates estimated from mutation accumulation lines in other organisms (that are on the order of\u2009~\u200910<sup>-6</sup> per gene/generation). The deletions and duplications were enriched in regions that were AT-rich even compared to the genomic background, in contrast to our expectations if low GC content was contributing to low mutation rates. The low deletion and duplication mutation rates in D. discoideum compared to other eukaryotes mirror their low point mutation rates, supporting previous work suggesting that this organism has high replication fidelity and effective molecular machinery to avoid the accumulation of mutations in their genome.",

        "abstract": "Glucose-regulated 94 kDa protein (Grp94) is a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of multicellular eukaryotes. It is a constitutively expressed protein that is overexpressed in certain abnormal conditions of the cell such as depletion of glucose and calcium, and low oxygen and pH. The protein is also implicated in diseased conditions like cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the consequences of downregulation of Grp94 were investigated at both unicellular and multicellular stages of Dictyostelium discoideum. Previous studies have shown the expression of Dd-Grp94 (Dictyostelium discoideum glucose-regulated 94 kDa protein) in wild-type cells varies during development, and overexpression of Dd-Grp94 leads to abnormal cell shape and inhibition of development (i.e., formation of fruiting bodies). Grp94 is a known calcium binding protein and an efficient calcium buffer. Therefore, in the present study we hypothesized that downregulation of Dd-Grp94 protein would affect Dictyostelium cell structure, growth, and development. We found that Dd-grp94 RNAi recombinants exhibited reduced growth rate, cell size, and a subtle change in cell motility compared to the parental cells. The recombinants also exhibited a delay in development and small fruiting bodies. These results establish that Dd-grp94 plays a crucial role in determining normal cell structure, growth and differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Organisms like Dictyostelium discoideum, often referred to as DNA damage \"extremophiles\", can survive exposure to extremely high doses of radiation and DNA crosslinking agents. These agents form highly toxic DNA crosslinks that cause extensive DNA damage. However, little is known about how Dictyostelium and the other \"extremophiles\" can tolerate and repair such large numbers of DNA crosslinks. Here we describe a comprehensive genetic analysis of crosslink repair in Dictyostelium discoideum. We analyse three gene groups that are crucial for a replication-coupled repair process that removes DNA crosslinks in higher eukarya: The Fanconi anaemia pathway (FA), translesion synthesis (TLS), and nucleotide excision repair. Gene disruption studies unexpectedly reveal that the FA genes and the TLS enzyme Rev3 play minor roles in tolerance to crosslinks in Dictyostelium. However, disruption of the Xpf nuclease subcomponent results in striking hypersensitivity to crosslinks. Genetic interaction studies reveal that although Xpf functions with FA and TLS gene products, most Xpf mediated repair is independent of these two gene groups. These results suggest that Dictyostelium utilises a distinct Xpf nuclease-mediated repair process to remove crosslinked DNA. Other DNA damage-resistant organisms and chemoresistant cancer cells might adopt a similar strategy to develop resistance to DNA crosslinking agents.",

        "abstract": "Centrins are a family of proteins within the calcium-binding EF-hand superfamily. In addition to their archetypical role at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), centrins have acquired multiple functionalities throughout the course of evolution. For example, centrins have been linked to different nuclear activities, including mRNA export and DNA repair. Dictyostelium discoideum centrin B is a divergent member of the centrin family. At the amino acid level, DdCenB shows 51% identity with its closest relative and only paralog, DdCenA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DdCenB and DdCenA form a well-supported monophyletic and divergent group within the centrin family of proteins. Interestingly, fluorescently tagged versions of DdCenB were not found at the centrosome (in whole cells or in isolated centrosomes). Instead, DdCenB localized to the nuclei of interphase cells. This localization disappeared as the cells entered mitosis, although Dictyostelium cells undergo a closed mitosis in which the nuclear envelope (NE) does not break down. DdCenB knockout cells exhibited aberrant nuclear architecture, characterized by enlarged and deformed nuclei and loss of proper centrosome-nucleus anchoring (observed as NE protrusions). At the centrosome, loss of DdCenB resulted in defects in the organization and morphology of the MTOC and supernumerary centrosomes and centrosome-related bodies. The multiple defects that the loss of DdCenB generated at the centrosome can be explained by its atypical division cycle, transitioning into the NE as it divides at mitosis. On the basis of these findings, we propose that DdCenB is required at interphase to maintain proper nuclear architecture, and before delocalizing from the nucleus, DdCenB is part of the centrosome duplication machinery.",

We have characterized more than half of these ABC transporters through a systematic study of mutations in their genes. We have analyzed morphological and transcriptional phenotypes for these mutants during growth and development and found that most of the mutants exhibited rather subtle phenotypes. A few of the genes may share physiological functions, as reflected in their transcriptional phenotypes. Since most of the abc-transporter mutants showed subtle morphological phenotypes, we utilized these transcriptional phenotypes to identify genes that are important for development by looking for transcripts whose abundance was unperturbed in most of the mutants.

The commonly used laboratory strains of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum have extremely high fluid uptake rates when grown in nutrient medium, over 90% of which is due to macropinocytosis. In addition, many of the known core components of mammalian macropinocytosis are also present, making it an excellent model system for studying macropinocytosis. Here, the standard technique to measure internalized fluid using fluorescent dextran as a label is adapted to a 96-well plate format, with the samples analyzed by flow cytometry using a high-throughput sampling (HTS) attachment. Cells are fed non-quenchable fluorescent dextran for a pre-determined length of time, washed by immersion in ice-cold buffer and detached using 5 mM sodium azide, which also stops exocytosis. Cells in each well are then analyzed by flow cytometry. The method can also be adapted to measure membrane uptake and phagocytosis of fluorescent beads or bacteria. This method was designed to allow measurement of fluid uptake by Dictyostelium in a high-throughput, labor and resource efficient manner. It allows simultaneous comparison of multiple strains (e.g. knockout mutants of a gene) and conditions (e.g. cells in different media or treated with different concentrations of inhibitor) in parallel and simplifies time-courses.",

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and potent catechin in green tea, has significant effects on the Dictyostelium life cycle. In the presence of EGCG aggregation is delayed, cells do not stream and development is typically stalled at the loose aggregate stage. The developmental effects very likely result from defects in motility, as EGCG reduces both random movement and chemotaxis of Dictyostelium amoebae.

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic cell division requires the co-ordinated assembly and disassembly of the mitotic spindle, accurate chromosome segregation and temporal control of cytokinesis to generate two daughter cells. While the absolute details of these processes differ between organisms, there are evolutionarily conserved core components common to all eukaryotic cells, whose identification will reveal the key processes that control cell division. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a major protein kinase found throughout the eukaryotes and regulates many processes, including cell differentiation, growth, motility and apoptosis. In animals, GSK-3 associates with mitotic spindles and its inhibition causes mis-regulation of chromosome segregation. Two suppressor screens in yeast point to a more general effect of GSK-3 on cell division, however the direct role of GSK-3 in control of mitosis has not been explored outside the animal kingdom. Here we report that the Dictyostelium discoideum GSK-3 orthologue, GskA, associates with the mitotic spindle during cell division, as seen for its mammalian counterparts. Dictyostelium possesses only a single GSK-3 gene that can be deleted to eliminate all GSK-3 activity. We found that gskA-null mutants failed to elongate their mitotic spindle and were unable to divide in shaking culture, but have no chromosome segregation defect. These results suggest further conservation for the role of GSK-3 in the regulation of spindle dynamics during mitosis, but also reveal differences in the mechanisms ensuring accurate chromosome segregation.",

It typically occurs in synchrony with the cell cycle to ensure that a complete copy of the genetic information is passed on to the next generation of daughter cells. In animal cells, cytokinesis commonly relies on an actomyosin contractile ring that drives equatorial furrowing and separation into the two daughter cells. However, also contractile ring-independent forms of cell division are known that depend on substrate-mediated traction forces. Here, we report evidence of an as yet unknown type of contractile ring-independent cytokinesis that we termed wave-mediated cytofission. It is driven by self-organized cortical actin waves that travel across the ventral membrane of oversized, multinucleated <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells. Upon collision with the cell border, waves may initiate the formation of protrusions that elongate and eventually pinch off to form separate daughter cells. They are composed of a stable elongated wave segment that is enclosed by a cell membrane and moves in a highly persistent fashion.

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the model organism for the evolutionary supergroup of Amoebozoa, is a social amoeba that, upon starvation, undergoes transition from a unicellular to a multicellular organism. In its genome, we identified two genes encoding for tRNA nucleotidyltransferases. Such pairs of tRNA nucleotidyltransferases usually represent collaborating partial activities catalyzing CC- and A-addition to the tRNA 3'-end, respectively. In <i>D. discoideum</i>, however, both enzymes exhibit identical activities, representing bona-fide CCA-adding enzymes. Detailed characterization of the corresponding activities revealed that both enzymes seem to be essential and are regulated inversely during different developmental stages of <i>D. discoideum</i>. Intriguingly, this is the first description of two functionally equivalent CCA-adding enzymes using the same set of tRNAs and showing a similar distribution within the cell. This situation seems to be a common feature in Dictyostelia, as other members of this phylum carry similar pairs of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase genes in their genome.",

The amoeba cells were infected with a different multiplicity of infection (5, 10, and 100) and incubated at different temperatures (22, 25, 27, 30, and 37\u00b0C). The number of intracellular bacteria within <i>D. discoideum</i>, as well as cytotoxicity, was determined at 2, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after infection. Our results showed that the optimal temperature for <i>Francisella</i> intracellular replication within amoeba is 30\u00b0C with the MOI of 10.

        "abstract": "Upon starvation, Dictyostelium discoideum cells halt cell proliferation, aggregate into multicellular organisms, form migrating slugs, and undergo morphogenesis into fruiting bodies while differentiating into dormant spores and dead stalk cells. At almost any developmental stage cells can be forced to dedifferentiate when they are dispersed and diluted into nutrient broth. However, migrating slugs can traverse lawns of bacteria for days without dedifferentiating, ignoring abundant nutrients and continuing development. We now show that developing Dictyostelium cells revert to the growth phase only when bacteria are supplied during the first 4 to 6 h of development but that after this time, cells continue to develop regardless of the presence of food. We postulate that the cells' inability to revert to the growth phase after 6 h represents a commitment to development. We show that the onset of commitment correlates with the cells' loss of phagocytic function. By examining mutant strains, we also show that commitment requires extracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. Moreover, cAMP pulses are sufficient to induce both commitment and the loss of phagocytosis in starving cells, whereas starvation alone is insufficient. Finally, we show that the inhibition of development by food prior to commitment is independent of contact between the cells and the bacteria and that small soluble molecules, probably amino acids, inhibit development during the first few hours and subsequently the cells become unable to react to the molecules and commit to development. We propose that commitment serves as a checkpoint that ensures the completion of cooperative aggregation of developing Dictyostelium cells once it has begun, dampening the response to nutritional cues that might inappropriately block development.",

        "abstract": "The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>'s proteome contains a vast array of simple sequence repeats, providing a unique model to investigate proteostasis. Upon conditions of cellular stress, <i>D. discoideum</i> undergoes a developmental process, transitioning from a unicellular amoeba to a multicellular fruiting body. Little is known about how proteostasis is maintained during <i>D. discoideum</i>'s developmental process. Here, we have identified a novel \u03b1-crystallin domain-containing protein, heat shock protein 48 (HSP48), that is upregulated during <i>D. discoideum</i> development. HSP48 functions in part by forming a biomolecular condensate via its highly positively charged intrinsically disordered carboxy terminus. In addition to HSP48, the highly negatively charged primordial chaperone polyphosphate is also upregulated during <i>D. discoideum</i> development, and polyphosphate functions to stabilize HSP48. Upon germination, levels of both HSP48 and polyphosphate dramatically decrease, consistent with a role for HSP48 and polyphosphate during development. Together, our data demonstrate that HSP48 is strongly induced during <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> development. We also demonstrate that HSP48 forms a biomolecular condensate and that polyphosphate is necessary to stabilize the HSP48 biomolecular condensate.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> During cellular stress, many microbes undergo a transition to a dormant state. This includes the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> that transitions from a unicellular amoeba to a multicellular fruiting body upon starvation. In this work, we identify heat shock protein 48 (HSP48) as a chaperone that is induced during development. We also show that HSP48 forms a biomolecular condensate and is stabilized by polyphosphate.

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is unusual among eukaryotes in having both unicellular and multicellular stages. In the multicellular stage, some cells, called sentinels, ingest toxins, waste and bacteria. The sentinel cells ultimately fall away from the back of the migrating slug, thus removing these substances from the slug. However, some D. discoideum clones (called farmers) carry commensal bacteria through the multicellular stage, while others (called non-farmers) do not. Farmers profit from their beneficial bacteria. To prevent the loss of these bacteria, we hypothesize that sentinel cell numbers may be reduced in farmers, and thus farmers may have a diminished capacity to respond to pathogenic bacteria or toxins. In support, we found that farmers have fewer sentinel cells compared with non-farmers. However, farmers produced no fewer viable spores when challenged with a toxin. These results are consistent with the beneficial bacteria Burkholderia providing protection against toxins. The farmers did not vary in spore production with and without a toxin challenge the way the non-farmers did, which suggests the costs of Burkholderia may be fixed while sentinel cells may be inducible. Therefore, the costs for non-farmers are only paid in the presence of the toxin. When the farmers were cured of their symbiotic bacteria with antibiotics, they behaved just like non-farmers in response to a toxin challenge. Thus, the advantages farmers gain from carrying bacteria include not just food and protection against competitors, but also protection against toxins.",

Our analysis revealed several known CaMBPs in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian cells (e.g., myosin, calcineurin), as well as many novel interactors (e.g., cathepsin D). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting proteins (STRING) analyses linked the CaM interactors to several cellular and developmental processes in <i>Dictyostelium</i> including cytokinesis, gene expression, endocytosis, and metabolism. The primary localizations of the CaM interactors include the nucleus, ribosomes, vesicles, mitochondria, cytoskeleton, and extracellular space. These findings are not only consistent with previous work on CaM and CaMBPs in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, but they also provide new insight on their diverse cellular and developmental roles in this model organism.

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum was instrumental in the discovery and early characterization of inositol pyrophosphates, a class of molecules possessing highly-energetic pyrophosphate bonds. Inositol pyrophosphates regulate diverse biological processes and are attracting attention due to their ability to control energy metabolism and insulin signalling. However, inositol pyrophosphate research has been hampered by the lack of simple experimental procedures to study them. The recent development of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and simple staining to resolve and detect inositol pyrophosphate species has opened new investigative possibilities. This technology is now commonly applied to study in vitro enzymatic reactions. Here we employ PAGE technology to characterize the D. discoideum inositol pyrophosphate metabolism. Surprisingly, only three major bands are detectable after resolving acidic extract on PAGE. We have demonstrated that these three bands correspond to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP\u2086 or Phytic acid) and its derivative inositol pyrophosphates, IP\u2087 and IP\u2088. Biochemical analyses and genetic evidence were used to establish the genuine inositol phosphate nature of these bands. We also identified IP\u2089 in D. discoideum cells, a molecule so far detected only from in vitro biochemical reactions. Furthermore, we discovered that this amoeba possesses three different inositol pentakisphosphates (IP\u2085) isomers, which are largely metabolised to inositol pyrophosphates. Comparison of PAGE with traditional Sax-HPLC revealed an underestimation of the cellular abundance of inositol pyrophosphates by traditional methods. In fact our study revealed much higher levels of inositol pyrophosphates in D. discoideum in the vegetative state than previously detected. A three-fold increase in IP\u2088 was observed during development of D. discoideum a value lower that previously reported. Analysis of inositol pyrophosphate metabolism using ip6k null amoeba revealed the absence of developmentally-induced synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates, suggesting that the alternative class of enzyme responsible for pyrophosphate synthesis, PP-IP\u2085K, doesn't' play a major role in the IP\u2088 developmental increase.",

Bacteria may also adapt to life inside amoebae, resulting in symbiotic relationships. Indeed, particular lineages of obligate bacterial endosymbionts have been found in different amoebae. Here, we screened an extensive collection of Dictyostelium discoideum wild isolates for the presence of these bacterial symbionts using endosymbiont specific PCR primers. We find that these symbionts are surprisingly common, identified in 42% of screened isolates (N\u00a0=\u2009730). Members of the Chlamydiae phylum are particularly prevalent, occurring in 27% of the amoeba isolated. They are novel and phylogenetically distinct from other Chlamydiae. We also found Amoebophilus symbionts in 8% of screened isolates (N\u00a0=\u2009730). Antibiotic-cured amoebae behave similarly to their Chlamydiae or Amoebophilus-infected counterparts, suggesting that these endosymbionts do not significantly impact host fitness, at least in the laboratory. We found several natural isolates were co-infected with multiple endosymbionts, with no obvious fitness effect of co-infection under laboratory conditions.

The simple eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum displays chemotactic locomotion in stages of its life cycle. By characterizing a Dictyostelium mutant defective in chemotactic responses, we identified a novel actin-binding protein serving to modulate cell migration and named it actin-binding protein G (AbpG); this 971-amino acid (aa) protein contains an N-terminal type 2 calponin homology (CH2) domain followed by two large coiled-coil regions. In chemoattractant gradients, abpG(-) cells display normal directional persistence but migrate significantly more slowly than wild-type cells; expressing Flag-AbpG in mutant cells eliminates the motility defect. AbpG is enriched in cortical/lamellipodial regions and colocalizes well with F-actin; aa 401-600 and aa 501-550 fragments of AbpG show the same distribution as full-length AbpG. The aa 501-550 region of AbpG, which is essential for AbpG to localize to lamellipodia and to rescue the phenotype of abpG(-) cells, is sufficient for binding to F-actin and represents a novel actin-binding protein domain. Compared with wild-type cells, abpG(-) cells have significantly higher F-actin levels. Collectively our results suggest that AbpG may participate in modulating actin dynamics to optimize cell locomotion.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and its endosymbiotic bacteria <i>Paraburkholderia</i> provides a model system for studying the development of symbiotic relationships. Laboratory experiments have shown that any of three species of the <i>Paraburkholderia</i> symbiont allow D. discoideum food bacteria to persist through the amoeba life cycle and survive in amoeba spores rather than being fully digested. This phenomenon is termed \"farming,\" as it potentially allows spores dispersed to food-poor locations to grow their own. The occurrence and impact of farming in natural populations, however, have been a challenge to measure. Here, we surveyed natural D. discoideum populations and found that only one of the three symbiont species, Paraburkholderia agricolaris, remained prevalent. We then explored the effect of <i>Paraburkholderia</i> on the amoeba microbiota, expecting that by facilitating bacterial food carriage, it would diversify the microbiota. Contrary to our expectations, <i>Paraburkholderia</i> tended to infectiously dominate the D. discoideum microbiota, in some cases decreasing diversity. Similarly, we found little evidence for <i>Paraburkholderia</i> facilitating the carriage of particular food bacteria. These findings highlight the complexities of inferring symbiont function in nature and suggest the possibility that <i>Paraburkholderia</i> could be playing multiple roles for its host. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The functions of symbionts in natural populations can be difficult to completely discern. The three <i>Paraburkholderia</i> bacterial farming symbionts of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum have been shown in the laboratory environment to allow the amoebas to carry, rather than fully digest, food bacteria. This potentially provides a fitness benefit to the amoebas upon dispersal to food-poor environments, as they could grow their food. We expected that meaningful food carriage would manifest as a more diverse microbiota. Surprisingly, we found that <i>Paraburkholderia</i> tended to infectiously dominate the D. discoideum microbiota rather than diversifying it. We determined that only one of the three <i>Paraburkholderia</i> symbionts has increased in prevalence in natural populations in the past 20\u2009years, suggesting that this symbiont may be beneficial, however. These findings suggest that <i>Paraburkholderia</i> may have an alternative function for its host, which drives its prevalence in natural populations.",

        "abstract": "Multicellular organisms contain various differentiated cells. Fate determination of these cells remains a fundamental issue. The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is a useful model organism for studying differentiation; it proliferates as single cells in nutrient-rich conditions, which aggregate into a multicellular body upon starvation, subsequently differentiating into stalk cells or spores. The fates of these cells can be predicted in the vegetative phase: Cells expressing higher and lower levels of omt12 differentiate into stalk cells and spores, respectively. However, omt12 is merely a marker gene and changes in its expression do not influence the cell fate, and determinant factors remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed cell fate determinants in the stalk-destined and spore-destined cells that were sorted based on omt12 expression. Luciferase assay demonstrated higher levels of intracellular ATP in the stalk-destined cells than in the spore-destined cells. Live-cell observation during development using ATP sensor probes revealed that cells with higher ATP levels differentiated into stalk cells. Furthermore, reducing the ATP level by treating with an inhibitor of ATP production changed the differentiation fates of the stalk-destined cells to spores. These results suggest that intracellular ATP levels influence cell fates in D.\u00a0discoideum differentiation.",

        "abstract": "The Dictyostelium discoideum ampA gene encodes a multifunctional regulator protein that modulates cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions and actin polymerization during growth and is necessary for correct cell type specification and patterning during development. Insertional inactivation of the ampA gene results in defects that define two distinct roles for the ampA gene during development. AmpA is necessary in a non-cell autonomous manner to prevent premature expression of a prespore gene marker. It is also necessary in a cell autonomous manner for the anterior like cells, which express the ampA gene, to migrate to the upper cup during culmination. It is also necessary to prevent excessive cell-cell agglutination when cells are developed in a submerged suspension culture. Here, we demonstrate that a supernatant source of AmpA protein, added extracellularly, can prevent the premature mis-expression of the prespore marker. Synthetic oligopeptides are used to identify the domain of the AmpA protein that is important for preventing cells from mis-expressing the prespore gene. We further demonstrate that a factor capable of inducing additional cells to express the prespore gene marker accumulates extracellularly in the absence of AmpA protein. While the secreted AmpA acts extracellularly to suppress prespore gene expression, the effects of AmpA on cell agglutination and on actin polymerization in growing cells are not due to an extracellular role of secreted AmpA protein. Rather, these effects appear to reflect a distinct cell autonomous role of the ampA gene. Finally, we show that secretion of AmpA protein is brought about by elevating the levels of expression of ampA so that the protein accumulates to an excessive level.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis, or migration up a gradient of a chemoattractant, is the best understood mode of directed migration. Studies using social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum revealed that a complex signal transduction network of parallel pathways amplifies the response to chemoattractants, and leads to biased actin polymerization and protrusion of a pseudopod in the direction of a gradient. In contrast, molecular mechanisms driving other types of directed migration, for example, due to exposure to shear flow or electric fields, are not known. Many regulators of chemotaxis exhibit localization at the leading or lagging edge of a migrating cell, as well as show transient changes in localization or activation following global stimulation with a chemoattractant. To understand the molecular mechanisms of other types of directed migration we developed a method that allows examination of cellular response to acute mechanical stimulation based on brief (2 - 5 s) exposure to shear flow. This stimulation can be delivered in a channel while imaging cells expressing fluorescently-labeled biosensors to examine individual cell behavior. Additionally, cell population can be stimulated in a plate, lysed, and immunoblotted using antibodies that recognize active versions of proteins of interest. By combining both assays, one can examine a wide array of molecules activated by changes in subcellular localization and/or phosphorylation. Using this method we determined that acute mechanical stimulation triggers activation of the chemotactic signal transduction and actin cytoskeleton networks. The ability to examine cellular responses to acute mechanical stimulation is important for understanding the initiating events necessary for shear flow-induced motility. This approach also provides a tool for studying the chemotactic signal transduction network without the confounding influence of the chemoattractant receptor.",

Here, we scrutinized chemotaxis of single Dictyostelium discoideum cells under conditions of starvation using a variety of optical, electrical and acoustic methods. Amebas were seeded on gold electrodes displaying impedance oscillations that were simultaneously analyzed by optical video microscopy to relate synchronous changes in cell density, morphology, and distance from the surface to the transient impedance signal. We found that starved amebas periodically reduce their overall distance from the surface producing a larger impedance and higher total fluorescence intensity in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, we propose that the dominant sources of the observed impedance oscillations observed on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing electrodes are periodic changes of the overall cell-substrate distance of a cell. These synchronous changes of the cell-electrode distance were also observed in the oscillating signal of acoustic resonators covered with amebas. We also found that periodic cell-cell aggregation into transient clusters correlates with changes in the cell-substrate distance and might also contribute to the impedance signal. It turned out that cell-cell contacts as well as cell-substrate contacts form synchronously during chemotaxis of Dictyostelium discoideum cells.",

In this study, we used the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba as a model phagocyte to study the fate of the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae inside phagosomes. Our analysis distinguishes three consecutive phases: bacteria first lose their ability to divide (killing), then their cytosolic content is altered (permeabilization), and finally their DNA is degraded (digestion). Phagosomal acidification and production of free radicals are necessary for rapid killing, membrane-permeabilizing proteins BpiC and AlyL are required for efficient permeabilization. These results illustrate how a combination of genetic and microscopical tools can be used to finely dissect the molecular events leading to bacterial killing and permeabilization in a maturing phagosome.",

        "abstract": "PROPPINs are conserved PtdIns3P-binding proteins required for autophagosome biogenesis that fold into a characteristic group of seven-bladed beta-propellers. Mutations in WDR45/WIPI4, a human member of this family, lead to BPAN, a rare form of neurodegeneration. We have generated mutants for the two PROPPIN proteins present in the model system <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> (Atg18 and Wdr45l) and characterized their function. Lack of Wdr45l greatly impairs autophagy, while Atg18 only causes subtle defects in the maturation of autolysosomes. The strong phenotype of the Wdr45l mutant is strikingly similar to that observed in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells lacking Vmp1, an ER protein required for omegasome formation. Common phenotypes include impaired growth in axenic medium, lack of aggregation, and local enrichment of PtdIns3P as determined by the use of lipid reporters. In addition, Vmp1 and Wdr45l mutants show a chronically active response to ER stress. For both mutants, this altered PtdIns3P localization can be prevented by the additional mutation of the upstream regulator Atg1, which also leads to recovery of axenic growth and reduction of ER stress. We propose that, in addition to an autophagy defect, local autophagy-associated PtdIns3P accumulation might contribute to the pathogenesis of BPAN by disrupting ER homeostasis. The introduction of BPAN-associated mutations in <i>Dictyostelium</i> Wdr45l reveals the impact of pathogenic residues on the function and localization of the protein.",

Together with glucosidase I, this enzyme mediates part of the initial processing of N-glycans; defects in either glucosidase are associated with human diseases and result in an accumulation of incorrectly processed oligosaccharides which are not, or only poor, substrates for a range of downstream enzymes. To examine the effect of the glucosidase II mutation in Dictyostelium, we employed off-line LC-MALDI-TOF MS in combination with chemical and enzymatic treatments and MS/MS to analyze the neutral and anionic N-glycans of the mutant as compared to the wild type. The major neutral species were, as expected, of the composition Hex10-11 HexNAc2-3 with one or two terminal glucose residues. Consistent with the block in processing of neutral N-glycans caused by the absence of glucosidase II, fucose was apparently absent from the N-glycans and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine was rare. The major anionic oligosaccharides were sulfated and/or methylphosphorylated forms of Hex8-11 HexNAc2-3 , many of which surprisingly lacked glucose residues entirely. As anionic N-glycans are considered to be mostly associated with lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium, we hypothesise that glycosidases present in the acidic compartments may act on the oligosaccharides attached to such slime mould proteins. Furthermore, our chosen analytical approach enabled us, via observation of diagnostic negative-mode MS/MS fragments, to determine the fine structure of the methylphosphorylated and sulfated N-glycans of the M31 glucosidase mutant in their native state.",

All these genes are preceded by a putative noncoding RNA gene promoter. Immunoprecipitation showed that snRNAs U1, U2, U4, and U5, but not U6, carry the conserved trimethylated 5' cap structure. A number of divergent U2 species are expressed in Dictyostelium. These RNAs carry the U2 RNA hallmark sequence and structure motifs but have an additional predicted stem-loop structure at the 5' end. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the other spliceosomal RNAs in this study, the new U2 variants were enriched in the cytoplasm and were developmentally regulated.

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is a eukaryotic microbial model system for multicellular development, cell-cell signaling, and social behavior. Key models of social evolution require an understanding of genetic relationships between individuals across the genome or possibly at specific genes, but the nature of variation within D. discoideum is largely unknown. We re-sequenced 137 gene fragments in wild North American strains of D. discoideum and examined the levels and patterns of nucleotide variation in this social microbial species. We observe surprisingly low levels of nucleotide variation in D. discoideum across these strains, with a mean nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.08%, and no strong population stratification among North American strains. We also do not find any clear relationship between nucleotide divergence between strains and levels of social dominance and kin discrimination. Kin discrimination experiments, however, show that strains collected from the same location show greater ability to distinguish self from non-self than do strains from different geographic areas. This suggests that a greater ability to recognize self versus non-self may arise among strains that are more likely to encounter each other in nature, which would lead to preferential formation of fruiting bodies with clonemates and may prevent the evolution of cheating behaviors within D. discoideum populations. Finally, despite the fact that sex has rarely been observed in this species, we document a rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs, the presence of recombinant genotypes among natural strains, and high estimates of the population recombination parameter rho. The SNP data indicate that recombination is widespread within D. discoideum and that sex as a form of social interaction is likely to be an important aspect of the life cycle.",

        "abstract": "Engulfment of extracellular material by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis depends on the ability of cells to generate specialized cup-shaped protrusions. To effectively capture and internalize their targets, these cups are organized into a ring or ruffle of actin-driven protrusion encircling a non-protrusive interior domain. These functional domains depend on the combined activities of multiple Ras and Rho family small GTPases, but how their activities are integrated and differentially regulated over space and time is unknown. Here, we show that the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum coordinates Ras and Rac activity using the multidomain protein RGBARG (RCC1, RhoGEF, BAR, and RasGAP-containing protein). We find RGBARG uses a tripartite mechanism of Ras, Rac, and phospholipid interactions to localize at the protruding edge and interface with the interior of both macropinocytic and phagocytic cups. There, we propose RGBARG shapes the protrusion by expanding Rac activation at the rim while suppressing expansion of the active Ras interior domain. Consequently, cells lacking RGBARG form enlarged, flat interior domains unable to generate large macropinosomes. During phagocytosis, we find that disruption of RGBARG causes a geometry-specific defect in engulfing rod-shaped bacteria and ellipsoidal beads. This demonstrates the importance of coordinating small GTPase activities during engulfment of more complex shapes and thus the full physiological range of microbes, and how this is achieved in a model professional phagocyte.",

        "abstract": "During aggregation of Dictyostelium discoideum, nondissipating, symmetrical, outwardly moving waves of cAMP direct cells towards aggregation centers. It has been assumed that the spatial and temporal characteristics of the front and back of each cAMP wave regulate both chemokinesis and chemotaxis. However, during the period preceding aggregation, cells acquire not only the capacity to chemotax in a spatial gradient of cAMP, but also in a spatial gradient of Ca(2+). The null mutant of the putative IplA Ca(2+) channel gene, iplA(-), undergoes normal chemotaxis in spatial gradients of cAMP and normal chemokinetic responses to increasing temporal gradients of cAMP, both generated in vitro. However, iplA(-) cells lose the capacity to undergo chemotaxis in response to a spatial gradient of Ca(2+), suggesting that IplA is either the Ca(2+) chemotaxis receptor or an essential component of the Ca(2+) chemotaxis regulatory pathway. In response to natural chemotactic waves generated by wild-type cells, the chemokinetic response of iplA(-) cells to the temporal dynamics of the cAMP wave is intact, but the capacity to reorient in the direction of the aggregation center at the onset of each wave is lost. These results suggest that transient Ca(2+) gradients formed between cells at the onset of each natural cAMP wave augment reorientation towards the aggregation center. If this hypothesis proves correct, it will provide a more complex contextual framework for interpreting D. discoideum chemotaxis.",

The relatively small ( approximately 34 Mb) chromosomal genome of Dictyostelium and high efficiency of targeted gene disruption have enabled researchers to characterize many specific gene functions. However, the number of selectable markers in Dictyostelium is restricted, as is the ability to perform effective genetic crosses between strains. Thus, it has been difficult to create multiple mutations within an individual cell to study epistatic relationships among genes or potential redundancies between various pathways. We now describe a robust system for the production of multiple gene mutations in Dictyostelium by recycling a single selectable marker, Blasticidin S resistance, using the Cre-loxP system. We confirm the effectiveness of the system by generating a single cell carrying four separate gene disruptions. Furthermore, the cells remain sensitive to transformation for additional targeted or random mutagenesis requiring Blasticidin selection and for functional expression studies of mutated or tagged proteins using other selectable markers.",

However, few endogenous chemorepellants have been identified, and how they function is unclear. We found that the autocrine signal AprA, which is produced by growing Dictyostelium discoideum cells and inhibits their proliferation, also functions as a chemorepellant. Wild-type cells at the edge of a colony show directed movement outward from the colony, whereas cells lacking AprA do not. Cells show directed movement away from a source of recombinant AprA and dialyzed conditioned media from wild-type cells, but not dialyzed conditioned media from aprA(-) cells. The secreted protein CfaD, the G protein G\u03b18, and the kinase QkgA are necessary for the chemorepellant activity of AprA as well as its proliferation-inhibiting activity, whereas the putative transcription factor BzpN is dispensable for the chemorepellant activity of AprA but necessary for inhibition of proliferation. Phospholipase C and PI3 kinases 1 and 2, which are necessary for the activity of at least one other chemorepellant in Dictyostelium, are not necessary for recombinant AprA chemorepellant activity. Starved cells are not repelled by recombinant AprA, suggesting that aggregation-phase cells are not sensitive to the chemorepellant effect. Cell tracking indicates that AprA affects the directional bias of cell movement, but not cell velocity or the persistence of cell movement. Together, our data indicate that the endogenous signal AprA acts as an autocrine chemorepellant for Dictyostelium cells.",

It has recently been proposed that such heterogeneity exists during normal embryonic development to allow position independent patterning based on 'salt and pepper' differentiation and sorting out. However, the molecular basis of lineage priming and how it leads to reproducible cell type proportioning are poorly understood. To address this, we employed a novel forward genetic approach in the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. These studies reveal that the Ras-GTPase regulator gefE is required for normal lineage priming and salt and pepper differentiation. This is because Ras-GTPase activity sets the intrinsic response threshold to lineage specific differentiation signals. Importantly, we show that although gefE expression is uniform, transcription of its target, rasD, is both heterogeneous and dynamic, thus providing a novel mechanism for heterogeneity generation and position-independent differentiation.

Some of these have come to play an important role in the study of cooperation and conflict, largely because, unlike most animals, they can be genetically manipulated and experimentally evolved. However, whereas animal social behavior can be observed and assessed in natural environments, microbes usually cannot, so we know little about microbial social adaptations in nature. This has led to some difficult-to-resolve controversies about social adaptation even for well-studied traits such as bacterial quorum sensing, siderophore production, and biofilms. Here we use molecular signatures of population genetics and molecular evolution to address controversies over the existence of altruism and cheating in social amoebas. First, we find signatures of rapid adaptive molecular evolution that are consistent with social conflict being a significant force in nature. Second, we find population-genetic signatures of purifying selection to support the hypothesis that the cells that form the sterile stalk evolve primarily through altruistic kin selection rather than through selfish direct reproduction. Our results show how molecular signatures can provide insight into social adaptations that cannot be observed in their natural context, and they support the hypotheses that social amoebas in the wild are both altruists and cheaters.",

The formation of rods is implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, such as certain myopathies and some neurological disorders. It is still not well understood what exactly triggers the formation of intranuclear rods, whether other proteins are involved, and what the underlying mechanisms of rod assembly or disassembly are. In this study, Dictyostelium discoideum was used to examine appearance, stages of assembly, composition, stability, and dismantling of rods. Our data show that intranuclear rods, in addition to actin and cofilin, are composed of a distinct set of other proteins comprising actin-interacting protein 1 (Aip1), coronin (CorA), filactin (Fia), and the 34\u2009kDa actin-bundling protein B (AbpB). A finely tuned spatio-temporal pattern of protein recruitment was found during formation of rods. Aip1 is important for the final state of rod compaction indicating that Aip1 plays a major role in shaping the intranuclear rods. In the absence of both Aip1 and CorA, rods are not formed in the nucleus, suggesting that a sufficient supply of monomeric actin is a prerequisite for rod formation.",

        "abstract": "Prion-like proteins can undergo conformational rearrangements from an intrinsically disordered to a highly ordered amyloid state. This ability to change conformation is encoded in distinctive domains, termed prion domains (PrDs). Previous work suggests that PrDs change conformation to affect protein function and create phenotypic diversity. More recent work shows that PrDs can also undergo many weak interactions when disordered, allowing them to organize the intracellular space into dynamic compartments. However, mutations within PrDs and altered aggregation properties have also been linked to age-related diseases in humans. Thus, the physiological role of prion-like proteins, the mechanisms regulating their conformational promiscuity and the links to disease are still unclear. Here, we summarize recent work with prion-like proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum. This work was motivated by the finding that D. discoideum has the highest content of prion-like proteins of all organisms investigated to date. Surprisingly, we find that endogenous and exogenous prion-like proteins remain soluble in D. discoideum and do not misfold and aggregate. We provide evidence that this is due to specific adaptations in the protein quality control machinery, which may allow D. discoideum to tolerate its highly aggregation-prone proteome. We predict that D. discoideum will be an important model to study the function of prion-like proteins and their mechanistic links to disease.",

We used two independent assays to quantify cell-substrate adhesion in mutants and in wild-type cells as a function of development. Using a microfluidic device that generates a range of hydrodynamic shear stress, we found that substratum adhesion decreases at least 10 fold during the first 6 hr of development of wild type cells. This result was confirmed using a single-cell assay in which cells were attached to the cantilever of an atomic force probe and allowed to adhere to untreated glass surfaces before being retracted. Both of these assays showed that the decrease in substratum adhesion was dependent on the cAMP receptor CAR1 which triggers development. Vegetative cells missing talin as the result of a mutation in talA exhibited slightly reduced adhesive properties compared to vegetative wild-type cells. In sharp contrast to wild-type cells, however, these talA mutant cells did not show further reduction of adhesion during development such that after 5 hr of development they were significantly more adhesive than developed wild type cells. In addition, both assays showed that substrate adhesion was reduced in 0 hr cells when the actin cytoskeleton was disrupted by latrunculin. Consistent with previous observations, substrate adhesion was also reduced in 0 hr cells lacking the membrane proteins SadA or SibA as the result of mutations in sadA or sibA. However, there was no difference in the adhesion properties between wild type AX3 cells and these mutant cells after 6 hr of development, suggesting that neither SibA nor SadA play an essential role in substratum adhesion during aggregation. Our results provide a quantitative framework for further studies of cell substratum adhesion in Dictyostelium.",

Multiple genes were predicted in representatives of each major group of Dictyostelia and expression analysis confirmed that our search approach identifies expressed Class I RNA genes with high accuracy and sensitivity and that the RNAs are developmentally regulated. Further studies showed that Class I RNAs are ubiquitous in Dictyostelia and share highly conserved structure and sequence motifs. In addition, Class I RNA genes appear to be unique to dictyostelid social amoebas because they could not be identified in outgroup genomes, including their closest known relatives. Our results show that Class I RNA is an ancient class of ncRNAs, likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of Dictyostelia dating back at least 600 million years. Based on previous functional analyses and the presented evolutionary investigation, we hypothesize that Class I RNAs were involved in evolution of multicellularity in Dictyostelia.",

        "abstract": "Many of the expanding roles of nucleoside diphosphate kinase have been attributed to its ability to interact with other proteins. One proposal is an interaction with the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase, and here, we apply the simple eukaryotic organism, Dictyostelium discoideum as a test model. Stable cotransformants were created in which NDPK expression was knocked down by antisense inhibition, and AMPK activity was chronically elevated either by constitutive overexpression of its active, catalytic domain (AMPK\u03b1T) or as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction (created by antisense inhibition of expression of a mitochondrial chaperone protein, chaperonin 60). To investigate a biochemical interaction, transformants were created which contained constructs expressing FLAG-NDPK and hexahistidine-tagged full-length AMPK or AMPK\u03b1T. The protein extract from these transformants was used in coimmunoprecipitations. Knock down of NDPK expression suppressed the phenotypic defects that are caused by AMPK hyperactivity resulting either from overexpression of AMPK\u03b1T or from mitochondrial dysfunction. These included rescue of defects in slug phototaxis, fruiting body morphology and growth in a liquid medium. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate a biochemical interaction between the two proteins. The results demonstrate a genetic interaction between NDPK and AMPK in Dictyostelium in that NDPK is required for the phenotypic effects of activated AMPK. Coimmunoprecipitations suggest that this interaction is not mediated by a direct interaction between the two proteins.",

While many aspects of this process are well investigated, the large cell-to-cell variability in the motile characteristics of an otherwise uniform population remains an open question that was largely ignored by previous models. In this article, we present a mathematical model of amoeboid motility that combines noisy bistable kinetics with a dynamic phase field for the cell shape. To capture cell-to-cell variability, we introduce a single parameter for tuning the balance between polarity formation and intracellular noise. We compare numerical simulations of our model to experiments with the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Despite the simple structure of our model, we found close agreement with the experimental results for the center-of-mass motion as well as for the evolution of the cell shape and the overall intracellular patterns. We thus conjecture that the building blocks of our model capture essential features of amoeboid motility and may serve as a starting point for more detailed descriptions of cell motion in chemical gradients and confined environments.",

A lower threshold concentration of 15 mM K+ or Na or 5 mM Ca2+ is required for chemotactic orientation. Although the common buffer solutions used by D. discoideum researchers to study chemotaxis contain sufficient concentrations of cations for chemotactic orientation, the majority contain insufficient levels to facilitate motility.

Some farmer-associated bacteria produce small molecules that promote host farmer growth but inhibit the growth of non-farmer competitors. To test whether the farmers' tolerance is specific or extends to other growth inhibitory bacteria, we tested whether farmer and non-farmer amoebae are differentially affected by E. coli strains of varying pathogenicity.

These amoebae extend pseudopodium - a temporary actin-based protrusion of their body membrane\u00a0to probe the medium and crawl through it. Experiments show highly-ordered patterns in the growth direction of these pseudopodia, which results in persistence cell motility. Here, we propose a discrete model for studying and investigating the cell locomotion based on the experimental evidences. According to our model, Dictyostelium selects its pseudopodium growth direction based on a second-order Markov chain process, in the absence of external cues. Consequently, compared to a random walk process, our model indicates stronger growth in the mean-square displacement of cells, which is consistent with empirical findings. In the presence of external chemical stimulants, cells tend to align with the gradient of chemoattractant molecules. To quantify this tendency, we define a coupling coefficient between the pseudopodium extension direction and the gradient of an external stimulant, which depends on the local stimulant concentration and its gradient. Additionally, we generalize the model to weak-coupling regime by utilizing perturbation methods.",

        "abstract": "Five or more orthophosphates bound together by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds are highly ubiquitous inorganic molecules called polyphosphate. Polyphosphate acts as a signaling molecule eliciting a number of responses in eukaryotic cells, but the mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. Proliferating Dictyostelium discoideum cells accumulate extracellular polyphosphate. At extracellular concentrations similar to those observed in stationary phase cells, polyphosphate inhibits proteasome activity and proliferation, and induces aggregation. Here we identify GrlD as a putative G protein-coupled receptor that mediates binding of extracellular polyphosphate to the cell surface. Cells lacking GrlD do not respond to polyphosphate-induced proteasome inhibition, aggregation, or proliferation inhibition. Polyphosphate also elicits differential effects on cell-substratum adhesion and cytoskeletal F-actin levels based on nutrient availability, and these effects were also mediated by GrlD. Starving cells also accumulate extracellular polyphosphate. Starved cells treated with exopolyphosphatase failed to aggregate effectively, suggesting that polyphosphate also acts as a signaling molecule during starvation-induced development of Dictyostelium. Together, these results suggest that a eukaryotic cell uses a G protein-coupled receptor to mediate the sensing and response to extracellular polyphosphate.",

        "abstract": "When they are fed with bacteria, Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae produce and secrete multilamellar bodies (MLBs), which are composed of membranous material. It has been proposed that MLBs are a waste disposal system that allows D. discoideum to eliminate undigested bacterial remains. However, the real function of MLBs remains unknown. Determination of the biochemical composition of MLBs, especially lipids, represents a way to gain information about the role of these structures. To allow these analyses, a protocol involving various centrifugation procedures has been developed to purify secreted MLBs from amoeba-bacterium cocultures. The purity of the MLB preparation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and by immunofluorescence using H36, an antibody that binds to MLBs. The lipid and fatty acid compositions of pure MLBs were then analyzed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and gas chromatography (GC), respectively, and compared to those of amoebae as well as bacteria used as a food source. While the bacteria were devoid of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), these two polar lipid species were major classes of lipids in MLBs and amoebae. Similarly, the fatty acid composition of MLBs and amoebae was characterized by the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids, while cyclic fatty acids were found only in bacteria. These results strongly suggest that the lipids constituting the MLBs originate from the amoebal metabolism rather than from undigested bacterial membranes. This opens the possibility that MLBs, instead of being a waste disposal system, have unsuspected roles in D. discoideum physiology.",

One way to assess the importance of kin discrimination is to test its effects on increasing relatedness within groups. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum aggregates to form a fruiting body composed of dead stalk and live spores. Previous studies of a natural population showed that where D. discoideum occurs in the soil, multiple clones are often found in the same small soil samples. However, actual fruiting bodies usually contain only one clone. We here performed experiments to gauge the effect of kin-discriminatory segregation on increasing relatedness. We mixed co-occurring clones from this population using a relatedness level found in small soil samples. We found a lower proportion of uniclonal fruiting bodies and a lower level of relatedness compared with natural fruiting bodies. We found that the amount of relatedness increase attributable to kin-discriminatory segregation was small. These findings suggest a relatively minor influence of kin-discriminatory segregation on relatedness in D. discoideum. We discuss our results comparing with the results of previous studies, including those of wild clones and laboratory mutants. We ask why wild clones of D. discoideum exhibit a low degree of kin-discriminatory segregation, and what alternative factors might account for high relatedness in D. discoideum.",

Information concerning the molecules involved in fertilization is accumulating for many species of the metazoan, plant, and fungal lineages, and the evolutionary consideration of sexual reproduction systems is now an interesting issue. Macrocyst formation in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a sexual process in which cells become sexually mature under dark and submerged conditions and fuse with complementary mating-type cells. In the present study, we isolated D. discoideum insertional mutants defective in sexual cell fusion and identified the relevant gene, macA, which encodes a highly glycosylated, 2,041-amino-acid membrane protein (MacA). Although its overall similarity is restricted to proteins of unknown function within dictyostelids, it contains LamGL and discoidin domains, which are implicated in cell adhesion. The growth and development of macA-null mutants were indistinguishable from those of the parental strain. The overexpression of macA using the V18 promoter in a macA-null mutant completely restored its sexual defects. Although the macA gene encoded exactly the same protein in a complementary mating-type strain, it was expressed at a much lower level. These results suggest that MacA is indispensable for gamete interactions in D. discoideum, probably via cell adhesion. There is a possibility that it is controlled in a mating-type-dependent manner.",

Only about a third of field-collected amoebae carry a symbiont.

Before curing, field-collected clones did not vary significantly in overall fitness, but infected hosts produced morphologically different multicellular structures. After curing and reinfecting, host fitness declined. However, natural <i>B. hayleyella</i> hosts suffered fewer fitness costs when reinfected with <i>B. hayleyella,</i> indicating that they have evolved mechanisms to tolerate their symbiont.

        "abstract": "Most multicellular organisms are uniclonal. This is hypothesized to be because uniclonal organisms function better than chimeras (non-clonal organisms), owing to reduced levels of internal genetic conflict. We tested this idea using the social amoeba or slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. When starving, the normally solitary amoebae aggregate to form a differentiated multicellular slug that migrates towards light and forms a fruiting body, facilitating the dispersal of spores. We added 10(7) amoebae to Petri plates containing 1, 2, 5 or 10 clones mixed together. We found an intrinsic cost to chimerism: chimeric slugs moved significantly less far than uniclonal slugs of the same size. However, in nature, joining with other clones to form a chimera should increase slug size, and larger slugs travel further. We incorporated this size effect into a second experiment by giving chimeras more cells than single clones (single clones had 10(6) cells, two-clone chimeras had 2 x 10(6) cells and so on). The uniclonal treatments then simulated a clone in a mixture that refuses to form chimeras. In this experiment, chimeras moved significantly further than the uniclonal slugs, in spite of the intrinsic cost. Thus, chimerism is costly, which may be why it evolves so seldom, but in D. discoideum the benefits of large size appear to compensate.",

IQGAP1 and its binding partner cortexillin I function downstream of \u03b1- and \u03b2-catenin to exclude myosin II from the basolateral cortex and promote apical accumulation of myosin II. Deletion of IQGAP1 or cortexillin compromises epithelial morphogenesis without affecting cell polarity. These results reveal that apical localization of myosin II is a conserved morphogenetic mechanism from nonmetazoans to vertebrates and identify a hierarchy of proteins that regulate the polarity and organization of an epithelial tube in\u00a0a simple model organism.",

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum associates with three species of Paraburkholderia endosymbionts, including P. agricolaris and P. hayleyella. These endosymbionts can be costly to the host but are beneficial in certain contexts because they allow D. discoideum to carry prey bacteria through the dispersal stage. In experiments where no other species are present, P. hayleyella benefits from D. discoideum while P. agricolaris does not. However, the presence of other species may influence this symbiosis. We tested if P. agricolaris and P. hayleyella benefit from D. discoideum in the context of resource competition with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the typical laboratory prey of D. discoideum. Without D. discoideum, K. pneumoniae depressed the growth of both Paraburkholderia symbionts, consistent with competition. P. hayleyella was more harmed by interspecific competition than P. agricolaris. We found that P. hayleyella was rescued from competition by D. discoideum, while P. agricolaris was not. This may be because P. hayleyella is more specialized as an endosymbiont; it has a highly reduced genome compared to P. agricolaris and may have lost genes relevant for resource competition outside of its host.",

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well-studied model organism to explore overall pictures of grouped behavior in developmental biology. The chemical waves secreted by aggregating Dictyostelium is a superb example of pattern formation. The waves are either circular or spiral in shape, according to the incremental population density of a self-aggregating community of individuals. Here, we revisit the spatiotemporal patterns that appear in an excitable medium due to synchronization of randomly firing individuals, but with a more parsimonious attitude. According to our model, a fraction of these individuals are less involved in amplifying external stimulants. Our simulations indicate that the cells enhance the system's asymmetry and as a result, nucleate early sustainable spiral territory zones, provided that their relative population does not exceed a tolerable threshold.",

We detected the first eukaryote diguanylate cyclases in all major groups of Dictyostelia. On food depletion, Dictyostelium discoideum amoebas collect into aggregates, which first transform into migrating slugs and then into sessile fruiting structures. These structures consist of a spherical spore mass that is supported by a column of stalk cells and a basal disk. A polyketide, DIF-1, which induces stalk-like cells in vitro, was isolated earlier. However, its role in vivo proved recently to be restricted to basal disk formation. Here we show that the Dictyostelium diguanylate cyclase, DgcA, produces c-di-GMP as the morphogen responsible for stalk cell differentiation. Dictyostelium discoideum DgcA synthesized c-di-GMP in a GTP-dependent manner and was expressed at the slug tip, which is the site of stalk cell differentiation. Disruption of the DgcA gene blocked the transition from slug migration to fructification and the expression of stalk genes. Fructification and stalk formation were restored by exposing DgcA-null slugs to wild-type secretion products or to c-di-GMP. Moreover, c-di-GMP, but not cyclic di-(3\u2032:5\u2032)-adenosine monophosphate, induced stalk gene expression in dilute cell monolayers. Apart from identifying the long-elusive stalk-inducing morphogen, our work also identifies a role for c-di-GMP in eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "The cooperative developmental system of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is susceptible to exploitation by cheaters-strains that make more than their fair share of spores in chimerae. Laboratory screens in Dictyostelium have shown that the genetic potential for facultative cheating is high, and field surveys have shown that cheaters are abundant in nature, but the cheating mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we describe cheater C (chtC), a strong facultative cheater mutant that cheats by affecting prestalk differentiation. The chtC gene is developmentally regulated and its mRNA becomes stalk-enriched at the end of development. chtC mutants are defective in maintaining the prestalk cell fate as some of their prestalk cells transdifferentiate into prespore cells, but that defect does not affect gross developmental morphology or sporulation efficiency. In chimerae between wild-type and chtC mutant cells, the wild-type cells preferentially give rise to prestalk cells, and the chtC mutants increase their representation in the spore mass. Mixing chtC mutants with other cell-type proportioning mutants revealed that the cheating is directly related to the prestalk-differentiation propensity of the victim. These findings illustrate that a cheater can victimize cooperative strains by exploiting an established developmental pathway.",

Dynamics of intracellular invasion, replication, and prevalence may underscore both host survivability and symbiont stability. More infectious symbionts might exert higher corresponding costs to hosts, which could ultimately disadvantage both partners. Here, we quantify infection patterns of diverse <i>Paraburkholderia</i> symbiont genotypes in their amoeba host <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and probe the relationship between these patterns and host outcomes. We exposed <i>D. discoideum</i> to thirteen strains of <i>Paraburkholderia</i> each belonging to one of the three symbiont species found to naturally infect <i>D. discoideum</i>: <i>Paraburkholderia agricolaris, Paraburkholderia hayleyella,</i> and <i>Paraburkholderia bonniea</i>. We quantified the infection prevalence and intracellular density of fluorescently labeled symbionts along with the final host population size using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. We find that infection phenotypes vary across symbiont strains. Symbionts belonging to the same species generally display similar infection patterns but are interestingly distinct when it comes to host outcomes. This results in final infection loads that do not strongly correlate to final host outcomes, suggesting other genetic factors that are not a direct cause or consequence of symbiont abundance impact host fitness.",

The external flow advects the signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) downstream, while the chemotactic cells attached to the solid substrate are not transported with the flow. At high flow velocities, elongated cAMP waves are formed that cover the whole length of the channel and propagate both parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction. While the wave period and transverse propagation velocity are constant, parallel wave velocity and the wave width increase linearly with the imposed flow. We also observe that the acquired wave shape is highly dependent on the wave generation site and the strength of the imposed flow. We compared the wave shape and velocity with numerical simulations performed using a reaction-diffusion model and found excellent agreement. These results are expected to play an important role in understanding the process of pattern formation and aggregation of D. discoideum that may experience fluid flows in its natural habitat.",

We report that AcbA is localized in vesicles that accumulate in the cortex of prespore cells just prior to sporulation. These vesicles are not observed after cells are stimulated to release AcbA but remain visible after stimulation in cells lacking the Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP). Acyl-CoA binding is required for the inclusion of AcbA in these vesicles, and the secretion of AcbA requires N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). About 1% of the total cellular AcbA can be purified within membrane-bound vesicles. The yield of vesicles decreases dramatically when purified from wild-type cells that were stimulated to release AcbA, whereas the yield from GRASP mutant cells was only modestly altered by stimulation. We suggest that these AcbA-containing vesicles are secretion intermediates and that GRASP functions at a late step leading to the docking/fusion of these vesicles at the cell surface.",

In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, there is evidence that some clones ('cheaters') contribute disproportionately to the viable spores in a fruiting body while avoiding the dead stalk cell fate. It remains unclear, however, whether this cheating is actually the product of selection. Here, I report the results of an experimental evolution study designed to test whether clones of D. discoideum will evolve resistance to cheating in the laboratory with genetic variation created only through spontaneous mutation. Two strains, one green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled and one wild-type, were allowed to grow and develop together before the wild-type strain was removed and replaced with a na\u00efve strain evolving in parallel. Over the course of 10 social generations, the GFP-labelled strain reliably increased its representation in the spores relative to control populations that had never experienced the competitor. This competitive advantage extended to the non-social, vegetative growth portion of the life cycle, but not to pairwise competition with two other strains. These results indicate strong antagonism between strains, mediated by ample mutational variation for cheating and also suggest that arms races between strains in the wild may be common.",

The social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, is known to use peptides to trigger sporulation within fruiting bodies, but their sequences have not been defined. We found that the peptide signal spore differentiation factor 2 (SDF-2) is processed from acyl-CoA binding protein, AcbA. The mammalian homolog of AcbA is processed to diazepam binding inhibitor that binds to the GABA(A) receptor in the brain and to peripheral 1,4 benzodiazepine receptors. Although Dictyostelium has neither GABA(A) nor peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, we find that both a diazepam binding inhibitor peptide and diazepam (Valium) can mimic SDF-2 in a Dictyostelium bioassay. Mutants lacking AcbA sporulate well only when developed in chimeras with WT cells. Using a yeast system we show that ligand binding to the SDF-2 receptor histidine kinase, DhkA, inhibits phosphorelay, which can account for its ability to induce rapid sporulation.",

This constitutes a quorum-sensing mechanism allowing coordinated regulation of cellular adhesion in a Dictyostelium population. In order to understand the mechanism underlying this regulation, we analyzed the expression of recently identified Dictyostelium adhesion molecules (Sib proteins) that present features also found in mammalian integrins. sibA and sibC are both expressed in vegetative Dictyostelium cells, but the expression of sibC is repressed strongly in conditions where cellular adhesion decreases. Analysis of sibA and sibC mutant cells further suggests that variations in the expression levels of sibC account largely for changes in cellular adhesion in response to environmental cues.",

In this study, we isolated a Dictyostelium mutant (fspA KO) unable to grow in the presence of non-capsulated Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria, but growing as efficiently as wild-type cells in the presence of other bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis. fspA KO cells were also unable to respond to K.\u2009pneumoniae and more specifically to bacterially secreted folate in a chemokinetic assay, while they responded readily to B.\u2009subtilis. Remarkably, both WT and fspA KO cells were able to grow in the presence of capsulated LM21 K.\u2009pneumoniae, and responded to purified capsule, indicating that capsule recognition may represent an alternative, FspA-independent mechanism for K.\u2009pneumoniae sensing. When LM21 capsule synthesis genes were deleted, growth and chemokinetic response were lost for fspA KO cells, but not for WT cells. Altogether, these results indicate that Dictyostelium amoebae use specific recognition mechanisms to respond to different K.\u2009pneumoniae elements.",

On the other hand, the CbfA and CbfB proteins have completely different carboxy-terminal domains, suggesting that the plasticity of such domains may have contributed to the adaptation of the CbfA-like transcription factors to the rapid genome evolution in the dictyostelid clade. To support this hypothesis we performed DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR measurements and found that CbfA regulates at least 160 genes during the vegetative growth of D. discoideum cells. Functional annotation of these genes revealed that CbfA predominantly controls the expression of gene products involved in housekeeping functions, such as carbohydrate, purine nucleoside/nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism. The CbfA protein displays two different mechanisms of gene regulation. The expression of one set of CbfA-dependent genes requires at least the JmjC/ZF domain of the CbfA protein and thus may depend on chromatin modulation. Regulation of the larger group of genes, however, does not depend on the entire CbfA protein and requires only the carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA (CbfA-CTD). An AT-hook motif located in CbfA-CTD, which is known to mediate DNA binding to A+T-rich sequences in vitro, contributed to CbfA-CTD-dependent gene regulatory functions in vivo.",

        "abstract": "AprA and CfaD are secreted proteins that function as autocrine signals to inhibit cell proliferation in Dictyostelium discoideum. Cells lacking AprA or CfaD proliferate rapidly, and adding AprA or CfaD to cells slows proliferation. Cells lacking the ROCO kinase QkgA proliferate rapidly, with a doubling time 83% of that of the wild type, and overexpression of a QkgA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein slows cell proliferation. We found that qkgA(-) cells accumulate normal levels of extracellular AprA and CfaD. Exogenous AprA or CfaD does not slow the proliferation of cells lacking qkgA, and expression of QkgA-GFP in qkgA(-) cells rescues this insensitivity. Like cells lacking AprA or CfaD, cells lacking QkgA tend to be multinucleate, accumulate nuclei rapidly, and show a mass and protein accumulation per nucleus like those of the wild type, suggesting that QkgA negatively regulates proliferation but not growth. Despite their rapid proliferation, cells lacking AprA, CfaD, or QkgA expand as a colony on bacteria less rapidly than the wild type. Unlike AprA and CfaD, QkgA does not affect spore viability following multicellular development. Together, these results indicate that QkgA is necessary for proliferation inhibition by AprA and CfaD, that QkgA mediates some but not all of the effects of AprA and CfaD, and that QkgA may function downstream of these proteins in a signal transduction pathway regulating proliferation.",

The transcription factor A family has been shown to be important for transcription of the human mitochondrial DNA, with some of its regulatory activity located in its extended C-terminal tail. The mitochondrial transcription factor B family often has functions not only in transcription, but also in mitochondrial rRNA modification, a hallmark of its \u03b1-proteobacterial origin. We have identified and characterised a mitochondrial transcription factor B homolog in the soil dwelling cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, an organism widely established as a model for studying eukaryotic cell biology. Using in bacterio functional assays, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial transcription factor B homolog not only functions as a mitochondrial transcription factor, but that it also has a role in rRNA methylation. Additionally, we show that the transcriptional activation properties of the D. discoideum protein are located in its extended C-terminal tail, a feature not seen before in the mitochondrial transcription factor B family, but reminiscent of the human mitochondrial transcription factor A. This report contributes to our current understanding of the complexities of mitochondrial transcription, and its evolution in eukaryotes.",

In addition to nanobeam small-angle x-ray scattering, we have evaluated the x-ray differential phase contrast in view of the projected electron density. Different experimental aspects of the x-ray experiment, sample preparation, and data analysis are discussed.

The mechanical forces exerted on the substratum during these contractions have recently been quantified using traction force experiments. Based on the results from these experiments, we present a biomechanical model of the contraction phase of Dictyostelium discoideum motility with an emphasis on the adhesive properties of the cell-substratum contact. Our model assumes that the cell contracts at a constant rate and is bound to the substratum by adhesive bridges that are modeled as elastic springs. These bridges are established at a spatially uniform rate while detachment occurs at a spatially varying, load-dependent rate. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming a rigid substratum, we find that the cell speed depends only weakly on the detachment kinetics of the cell-substratum interface, in agreement with experimental data. By varying the parameters that control the adhesive and contractile properties of the cell, we are able to make testable predictions. We also extend our model to include a flexible substrate and show that our model is able to produce substratum deformations and force patterns that are quantitatively and qualitatively in agreement with experimental data.",

The Dictyostelium discoideum retinoblastoma orthologue RblA affects the differentiation of cells during multicellular development, but it is unclear whether RblA has a significant effect on Dictyostelium cell proliferation, which is inhibited by the secreted proteins AprA and CfaD. We found that rblA\u207b cells in shaking culture proliferate to a higher density, die faster after reaching stationary density, and, after starvation, have a lower spore viability than wild-type cells, possibly because in shaking culture, rblA\u207b cells have both increased cytokinesis and lower extracellular accumulation of CfaD. However, rblA\u207b cells have abnormally slow proliferation on bacterial lawns. Recombinant AprA inhibits the proliferation of wild-type cells but not that of rblA\u207b cells, whereas CfaD inhibits the proliferation of both wild-type cells and rblA\u207b cells. Similar to aprA\u207b cells, rblA\u207b cells have a normal mass and protein accumulation rate on a per-nucleus basis, indicating that RblA affects cell proliferation but not cell growth. AprA also functions as a chemorepellent, and RblA is required for proper AprA chemorepellent activity despite the fact that RblA does not affect cell speed. Together, our data indicate that an autocrine proliferation-inhibiting factor acts through RblA to regulate cell density in Dictyostelium, suggesting that such factors may signal through retinoblastoma-like proteins to control the sizes of structures such as developing organs or tumors.",

Loss of ampA function results in reduced ability of growing cells to migrate to folic acid and causes small plaques on bacterial lawns, while overexpression of AmpA results in a rapid-migration phenotype and correspondingly larger plaques than seen with wild-type cells. To help understand how the ampA gene functions, second-site suppressors were created by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) mutagenesis. These mutants were selected for their ability to reduce the large plaque size of the AmpA overexpresser strain. The lmbd2B gene was identified as a suppressor of an AmpA-overexpressing strain. The lmbd2B gene product belongs to the evolutionarily conserved LMBR1 protein family, some of whose known members are endocytic receptors associated with human diseases, such as anemia. In order to understand lmbd2B function, mRFP fusion proteins were created and lmbd2B knockout cell lines were established. Our findings indicate that the LMBD2B protein is found associated with endocytic cups. It colocalizes with proteins that play key roles in endocytic events and is localized to ruffles on the dorsal surfaces of growing cells. Vegetative lmbd2B-null cells display defects in cell migration. These cells have difficulty sensing the chemoattractant folic acid, as indicated by a decrease in their chemotactic index. lmbd2B-null cells also appear to have difficulty establishing a front/back orientation to facilitate migration. A role for lmbd2B in development is also suggested. Our research gives insight into the function of a previously uncharacterized branch of the LMBR1 family of proteins. We provide evidence of an LMBR1 family plasma membrane protein that associates with endocytic cups and plays a role in chemotaxis.",

In the present study, we have applied HPLC and mass spectrometric methods to show that the major N-glycans in axenic cultures of the AX3 strain are oligomannosidic forms, most of which carry core fucose and/or intersecting and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues, including the major structure with the composition Man8GlcNAc4Fuc1. The postulated alpha1,3-linkage of the core fucose correlates with the cross-reactivity of Dictyostelium glycoproteins with a horseradish peroxidase antiserum; a corresponding core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase activity capable of modifying oligomannosidic N-glycans was detected in axenic Dictyostelium extracts. The presence of fucose on the N-glycans and the reactivity to the antiserum, but not the fucosyltransferase activity, are abolished in the fucose-deficient HL250 strain. In later stages of development, N-glycans at the mound and culmination stages show a reduction in both the size and the degree of modification by intersecting/bisecting residues compared with mid-exponential phase cultures, consistent with the hypothesis that glycosidase and glycosyltransferase expression levels are altered during the slime mould life cycle.",

Metazoan membrane-bound adenylate cyclases are composed of 12 transmembrane spanning regions, and two cyclase domains which function as a heterodimer and are activated by G-proteins. In contrast, membrane-bound guanylate cyclases have only one transmembrane spanning region and one cyclase domain, and are activated by extracellular ligands to form a homodimer. In the cellular slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum, membrane-bound guanylate cyclase activity is induced after cAMP stimulation; a G-protein-coupled cAMP receptor and G-proteins are essential for this activation. We have cloned a Dictyostelium gene, DdGCA, encoding a protein with 12 transmembrane spanning regions and two cyclase domains. Sequence alignment demonstrates that the two cyclase domains are transposed, relative to these domains in adenylate cyclases. DdGCA expressed in Dictyostelium exhibits high guanylate cyclase activity and no detectable adenylate cyclase activity. Deletion of the gene indicates that DdGCA is not essential for chemotaxis or osmo-regulation. The knock-out strain still exhibits substantial guanylate cyclase activity, demonstrating that Dictyostelium contains at least one other guanylate cyclase.",

By using the MS2 bacteriophage system, we now visualize the distribution of ACA mRNA in live chemotaxing cells. We found that the ACA mRNA localization is not dependent on the translation of the protein product and requires multiple cis-acting elements within the ACA-coding sequence. We show that ACA mRNA is associated with actively translating ribosomes and is transported along microtubules towards the back of cells. By monitoring the recovery of ACA-YFP after photobleaching, we observed that local translation of ACA-YFP occurs at the back of cells.

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a widely used model organism for studying basic functions of protozoan and metazoan cells, such as osmoregulation and cell motility. There is evidence from other species that cellular water channels, aquaporins (AQP), are central to both processes. Yet, data on D. discoideum AQPs is almost absent. Despite cloning of two putative D. discoideum AQPs, WacA, and AqpA, water permeability has not been shown. Further, WacA and AqpA are expressed at the late multicellular stage and in spores but not in amoebae. We cloned a novel AQP, AqpB, from amoeboidal D. discoideum cells. Wild-type AqpB was impermeable to water, glycerol, and urea when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Neither stepwise truncation of the N terminus nor selected point mutations activated the water channel. However, mutational truncation by 12 amino acids of an extraordinary long intracellular loop induced water permeability of AqpB, hinting at a novel gating mechanism. This AqpB mutant was inhibited by mercuric chloride, confirming the presence of a cysteine residue in the selectivity filter as predicted by our structure model. We detected AqpB by Western blot analysis in a glycosylated and a non-glycosylated form throughout all developmental stages. When expressed in D. discoideum amoebae, AqpB-GFP fusion constructs localized to vacuolar structures, to the plasma membrane, and to lamellipodia-like membrane protrusions. We conclude that the localization pattern in conjunction with channel gating may be indicative of AqpB functions in osmoregulation as well as cell motility of D. discoideum.",

We demonstrate here that M. marinum grows within Dictyostelium discoideum cells, allowing the genetic analysis of host factors that may modulate the replication of mycobacterial species. Intracellular growth of M. marinum was shown to mimic the properties previously observed for growth within cultured phagocytes. A defined bacterial mutant defective for growth within phagocytic cells was shown to be similarly defective for growth within D. discoideum. To test the role of host coronin, which was previously hypothesized to positively modulate mycobacterial growth within mouse macrophages, a defined D. discoideum coronin mutant was analyzed. Surprisingly, the absence of coronin resulted in enhanced intracellular replication of M. marinum relative to the control wild-type strain. Consistent with previous observations, some phagosomes showed persistence of coronin about the surface of the compartment, but colocalization of the protein was far from uniform. We conclude that in D. discoideum factors other than coronin support intracellular replication of M. marinum.",

Much can be learned from single gene knockouts in a eukaryote microbe. The mutants can be competed with the parent to discern the social impact of that specific gene. Dictyostelium discoideum is a social amoeba that exhibits cooperative behavior in the construction of a multicellular fruiting body. It is a good model organism to study the genetic basis of cooperation since it has a sequenced genome and it is amenable to genetic manipulation. When two strains of D. discoideum are mixed, a cheater strain can exploit its social partner by differentiating more spore than its fair share relative to stalk cells. Cheater strains can be generated in the lab or found in the wild and genetic analyses have shown that cheating behavior can be achieved through many pathways.",

        "abstract": "myo-Inositol and its downstream metabolites participate in diverse physiological processes. Nevertheless, considering their variety, it is likely that additional roles are yet to be uncovered. Biosynthesis of myo-inositol takes place via an evolutionarily conserved metabolic pathway and is strictly dependent on inositol-3-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Genetic manipulation of this enzyme will disrupt the cellular inositol supply. Two methods, based on gene deletion and antisense strategy, were used to generate mutants of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum. These mutants are inositol-auxotrophic and show phenotypic changes under inositol starvation. One remarkable attribute is their inability to live by phagocytosis of bacteria, which is the exclusive nutrient source in their natural environment. Cultivated on fluid medium, the mutants lose their viability when deprived of inositol for longer than 24 h. Here, we report a study of the alterations in the first 24 h in cellular inositol, inositol phosphate and phosphoinositide concentrations, whereby a rapidly accumulating phosphorylated compound was detected. After its identification as 2,3-BPG (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate), evidence could be found that the internal disturbances of inositol homoeostasis trigger the accumulation. In a first attempt to characterize this as a physiologically relevant response, the efficient in vitro inhibition of a D. discoideum inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.56) by 2,3-BPG is presented.",

We focus on the interplay between cell-substrate adhesion and cell-cell adhesion. We show that the loss of cell-surface contact does not significantly alter the dynamic pattern of protrusions and retractions of fast migrating amoeboid cells (Dictyostelium discoideum), but significantly changes their ability to adhere to other cells. Analysis of the dynamics of cell shapes reveals that cells that are adherent to a surface may coordinate their motion with neighbouring cells through protrusion waves that travel across cell-cell contacts. However, while shape waves exist if cells are detached from surfaces, they do not couple cell to cell. In addition, our investigation of actin polymerization indicates that loss of cell-surface adhesion changes actin polymerization at cell-cell contacts. To further investigate cell-cell/cell-substrate interactions, we used optical micromanipulation to form cell-substrate contact at controlled locations. We find that both cell-shape dynamics and cytoskeletal activity respond rapidly to the formation of cell-substrate contact.",

With the use of these models we are able to understand how modulation of adhesion and motile forces by CF can facilitate stream breakup. In addition, the modelling suggests a new possible mechanism for stream breakup involving the frequency of cell reorientation.",

The genome of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum encodes 11 Roco proteins. To study the functions of these proteins, we systematically knocked out the roco genes. Previously described functions for GbpC, Pats1, and QkgA (Roco1 to Roco3) were confirmed, while novel developmental defects were identified in roco4- and roco11-null cells. Cells lacking Roco11 form larger fruiting bodies than wild-type cells, while roco4-null cells show strong developmental defects during the transition from mound to fruiting body; prestalk cells produce reduced levels of cellulose, leading to unstable stalks that are unable to properly lift the spore head. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of four slime mold species reveals that QkgA and Roco11 evolved relatively late by duplication of an ancestor roco4 gene (later than approximately 300 million years ago), contrary to the situation with other roco genes, which were already present before the split of the common ancestor of D. discoideum and Polysphondylium pallidum (before approximately 600 million years ago). Together, our data show that the Dictyostelium Roco proteins serve a surprisingly diverse set of functions and highlight Roco4 as a key protein for proper stalk cell formation.",

Here we study this question for a particular system, the slug stage of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd). We investigate how cells in the interior of a migrating slug can effectively transmit stress to the substrate and thereby contribute to the overall motive force. Theoretical analysis suggests necessary conditions on the behavior of individual cells, and computational results shed light on experimental results concerning the total force exerted by a migrating slug. The model predicts that only cells in contact with the substrate contribute to the translational motion of the slug. Since the model is not based specifically on the mechanical properties of Dd cells, the results suggest that this behavior will be found in many developing systems.",

We mixed eight genetically distinct wild isolates and maintained twelve replicated populations at a high and a low relatedness treatment.

To identify early events, we examined potentially dying cells at a time when the classical signs of Dictyostelium cell death, such as heavy vacuolization and membrane lesions, were not yet apparent. We observed that most cells proceeded through a stereotyped series of differentiation stages, including the emergence of \"paddle\" cells showing high motility and strikingly marked subcellular compartmentalization with actin segregation. Paddle cell emergence and subsequent demise with paddle-to-round cell transition may be critical to the cell death process, as they were contemporary with irreversibility assessed through time-lapse videos and clonogenicity tests. Paddle cell demise was not related to formation of the cellulose shell because cells where the cellulose-synthase gene had been inactivated underwent death indistinguishable from that of parental cells. A major subcellular alteration at the paddle-to-round cell transition was the disappearance of F-actin. The Dictyostelium vacuolar cell death pathway thus does not require cellulose synthesis and includes early actin rearrangements (F-actin segregation, then depolymerization), contemporary with irreversibility, corresponding to the emergence and demise of highly polarized paddle cells.",

For a given cell, detachment occurs for values of the applied hydrodynamic stress above a threshold. Cells are removed from the substrate with an apparent first-order rate constant that strongly depends on the applied stress. The threshold stress depends on cell size and physicochemical properties of the substrate, but is not affected by depolymerization of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton. In contrast, the kinetics of cell detachment is almost independent of cell size, but is strongly affected by a modification of the substrate and the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton. These results are interpreted in the framework of a peeling model. The threshold stress and the cell-detachment rate measure the local equilibrium energy and the dissociation rate constant of the adhesion bridges, respectively.",

The aggregative nature of multicellular development makes the cells vulnerable to exploitation by cheaters, and the potential for cheating is indeed high. Cells might avoid being victimized if they can discriminate among individuals and avoid those that are genetically different. We tested how widely social amoebae cooperate by mixing isolates from different localities that cover most of their natural range. We show here that different isolates partially exclude one another during aggregation, and there is a positive relationship between the extent of this exclusion and the genetic distance between strains. Our findings demonstrate that D. discoideum cells co-aggregate more with genetically similar than dissimilar individuals, suggesting the existence of a mechanism that discerns the degree of genetic similarity between individuals in this social microorganism.",

Pathogenicity of C. neoformans for macrophages and vertebrate hosts may be a mechanism selected in evolution for protection against environmental predators. In this study, we investigated whether Dictyostelium discoideum could serve as an alternate host for C. neoformans. D. discoideum has a defined genetic system which provides significant advantages for the study of fungus-amoeba interactions. Our results show that D. discoideum is susceptible to infection with C. neoformans and that the interactions are similar to those described previously for this fungus with macrophages and Acanthamoeba castellanii. Acapsular C. neoformans cells did not replicate when coincubated with D. discoideum. However, incubation of acapsular C. neoformans with D. discoideum mutants defective in myosin VII synthesis resulted in infection, validating the concept that avirulent organisms can be virulent in impaired hosts even at the unicellular level. Phagocytosis of C. neoformans by D. discoideum could be inhibited with capsule-specific antibodies and various sugars. Passage of an encapsulated C. neoformans strain through D. discoideum cultures increased virulence and was accompanied by larger capsules and faster time to melanization. These results add to the evidence implicating soil ameboid predators as important factors for the maintenance of C. neoformans virulence in the environment and suggest that D. discoideum promises to be an extremely useful system for studying the interaction of C. neoformans with phagocytic cells.",

Imaging GFP-labeled AP180 showed that it localized to punctae at the plasma membrane, the contractile vacuole, and the cytoplasm and associated with clathrin. AP180 null cells did not display defects characteristic of clathrin mutants and continued to localize clathrin punctae on their plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm. However, like clathrin mutants, AP180 mutants, were osmosensitive. When immersed in water, AP180 null cells formed abnormally large contractile vacuoles. Furthermore, the cycle of expansion and contraction for contractile vacuoles in AP80 null cells was twice as long as that of wild-type cells. Taken together, our results suggest that AP180 plays a unique role as a regulator of contractile vacuole morphology and activity in Dictyostelium.",

In Dictyostelium discoideum, small GTPase methylation occurs seconds after stimulation of starving cells by cAMP and returns quickly to basal levels, suggesting an important role in cAMP-dependent signaling. Deleting the isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase-encoding gene causes dramatic defects. Starving mutant cells do not propagate cAMP waves in a sustained manner, and they do not aggregate. Motility is rescued when cells are pulsed with exogenous cAMP, or coplated with wild-type cells, but the rescued cells exhibit altered polarity. cAMP-pulsed methyltransferase-deficient cells that have aggregated fail to differentiate, but mutant cells plated in a wild-type background are able to do so. Localization of and signaling by RasG is altered in the mutant. Localization of the heterotrimeric Ggamma protein subunit was normal, but signaling was altered in mutant cells.

Single, unrelated genes are sufficient to determine two of the mating types, whereas homologs of both these genes are required in the composite type.

We have performed an initial test of this hypothesis in the model system Dictyostelium discoideum, which contains an ortholog of human PTEN, ptenA. Deletion of ptenA results in defects in motility, chemotaxis, aggregation and multicellular morphogenesis. D. discoideum also contains lpten, a newly discovered homolog of ptenA.

Tight control of actin dynamics is required for many cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, chemotaxis, endocytosis, exocytosis, and multicellular development. Here we describe a putative p21-activated protein kinase, PakD, that regulates the actin cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium discoideum. We found that cells lacking pakD are unable to aggregate and thus unable to develop. Compared to the wild type, cells lacking PakD have decreased membrane extensions, suggesting defective regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. pakD(-) cells show poor chemotaxis toward cyclic AMP (cAMP) but normal chemotaxis toward folate, suggesting that PakD mediates some but not all chemotaxis responses. pakD(-) cells have decreased polarity when placed in a cAMP gradient, indicating that the chemotactic defects of the pakD(-) cells may be due to an impaired cytoskeletal response to cAMP. In addition, while wild-type cells polymerize actin in response to global stimulation by cAMP, pakD(-) cells exhibit F-actin depolymerization under the same conditions. Taken together, the results suggest that PakD is part of a pathway coordinating F-actin organization during development.",

        "abstract": "A pair of adjacent genes, impA and dia1, are divergently transcribed but expressed at different stages in the life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum. The intervening 654-bp region carries cis-acting regions that are essential for transcription in both directions as well as repression of dia1 in growing cells. We have focused on a 112-bp region proximal to dia1 that is essential for bidirectional transcription. Analyses of a set of internal deletions showed that the sequence between positions 80 and 97 (TTTGAATTTTTTGAATTT) is critical and that bases outside this region are dispensable. Site-directed mutations within this critical region confirmed the importance of this sequence for transcription both to the right and to the left. However, insertions of either 6 or 24 Ts into the run of 6 Ts separating the repeated GAA sequence had little effect on the functioning of the site in either direction, suggesting that factors recognize the half-sites TTGAATT separately. Inversion of the bases between positions 80 and 97 greatly reduced expression in both directions, indicating that orientation is critical for expression of both the nearby impA gene and the distal dia1 gene, which is more than 500 bp away. Comparison of 38 mutant constructs with multiple random variations in the region indicated that transcription factors may bind to a range of related sequences and still retain function. All functional constructs directed transcription both leftward and rightward, while all nonfunctional constructs were impaired for transcription in both directions. It appears that the same transcription complex controls transcription of both impA and dia1.",

Even in social insects with high cooperation, the right to reproduce falls to the well-fed queens rather than to poorly fed workers. In Dictyostelium discoideum, formerly solitary amoebae aggregate when faced with starvation, and some cells die to form a stalk which others ride up to reach a better location to sporulate. The first cells to starve have lower energy reserves than those that starve later, and previous studies have shown that the better-fed cells in a mix tend to form disproportionately more reproductive spores. Therefore, one might expect that the first cells to starve and initiate the social stage should act altruistically and form disproportionately more of the sterile stalk, thereby enticing other better-fed cells into joining the aggregate. This would resemble caste determination in social insects, where altruistic workers are typically fed less than reproductive queens. However, we show that the opposite result holds: the first cells to starve become reproductive spores, presumably by gearing up for competition and outcompeting late starvers to become prespore first. These findings pose the interesting question of why others would join selfish organizers.",

        "abstract": "When individual amoebae of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum are starving, they aggregate to form a multicellular migrating slug, which moves toward a region suitable for culmination. The culmination of the morphogenesis involves complex cell movements that transform a mound of cells into a globule of spores on a slender stalk. The movement has been likened to a \"reverse fountain,\" whereby prestalk cells in the upper part form a stalk that moves downwards and anchors to the substratum, while prespore cells in the lower part move upwards to form the spore head. So far, however, no satisfactory explanation has been produced for this process. Using a computer simulation that we developed, we now demonstrate that the processes that are essential during the earlier stages of the morphogenesis are in fact sufficient to produce the dynamics of the culmination stage. These processes are cAMP signaling, differential adhesion, cell differentiation, and production of extracellular matrix. Our model clarifies the processes that generate the observed cell movements. More specifically, we show that periodic upward movements, caused by chemotactic motion, are essential for successful culmination, because the pressure waves they induce squeeze the stalk downwards through the cell mass. The mechanisms revealed by our model have a number of self-organizing and self-correcting properties and can account for many previously unconnected and unexplained experimental observations.",

Mutants lacking the catalytic domain of PkcA (pkcA(-)) did not exhibit tip dominance. A striking phenotype of pkcA- was the formation of an aggregate with a central hollow, and aggregates later fragmented to form small mounds, each becoming a fruiting body. Optical density wave patterns of cAMP in the late aggregates showed several cAMP wave generation centers. We attribute these defects in pkcA(-) to impaired cAMP signaling, altered cell motility and decreased expression of the cell adhesion molecules - CadA and CsaA. pkcA(-) slugs showed ectopic expression of ecmA in the prespore region. Further, the use of a PKC-specific inhibitor, GF109203X that inhibits the activity of catalytic domain phenocopied pkcA(-).",

Fifty-four prespore-specific genes were verified by in situ hybridization, including 18 that had been previously shown to be cell type specific. The 36 new genes more than doubles the number of available prespore markers. At the slug stage, the prespore genes hybridized to cells uniformly in the posterior 80% of wild-type slugs but hybridized to the posterior 90% of slugs lacking the secreted alkylphenone differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1). There was a compensatory twofold decrease in prestalk cells in DIF-less slugs. Removal of prespore cells resulted in cell type conversion in both wild-type and DIF-less anterior fragments.

One of the most successful answers to the challenge of establishing a spiral wave pattern in a colony of homogeneously distributed D. discoideum cells has been the suggestion of a developmental path the cells follow (Lauzeral and coworkers). This is a well-defined change in properties each cell undergoes on a longer time scale than the typical dynamics of the cell. Here we show that this concept leads to an inhomogeneous and systematic spatial distribution of spiral waves, which can be predicted from the distribution of cells on the developmental path.

        "abstract": "Here, we describe the identification and characterization of the cytokinesis-deficient mutant cell line 17HG5, which was generated in a restriction enzyme-mediated integration mutagenesis screen designed to isolate genes required for cytokinesis in Dictyostelium discoideum. Phenotypic characterization of the 17HG5 cell line revealed no apparent defects in the global functionality of the actomyosin cytoskeleton except for the observed cytokinesis defect when grown in suspension culture. Plasmid rescue was used to identify the disrupted gene locus (pats1; protein associated with the transduction of signal 1). that caused the cytokinesis defect. Disruption of the pats1 locus was recreated through homologous recombination in several independent cell lines, each recapitulating the cytokinesis-defective phenotype and thereby confirming that this gene locus is important for proper cytokinesis. Sequence data obtained by analysis of the genomic region flanking the inserted restriction enzyme-mediated integration plasmid revealed an 8892-bp genomic open reading frame encoding a 2964-amino-acid protein. The putative pats1 protein contains 3 regulatory domains (RI-phosphatase, RII-GTP-binding, R-III protein kinase), 13 leucine-rich repeats, and 8 WD-40 repeats. These regulatory domains coupled with the protein-protein interacting domains suggest that pats1 is involved in signal transduction during cytokinesis in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "Huntingtin is a large HEAT repeat protein first identified in humans, where a polyglutamine tract expansion near the amino terminus causes a gain-of-function mechanism that leads to selective neuronal loss in Huntington's disease (HD). Genetic evidence in humans and knock-in mouse models suggests that this gain-of-function involves an increase or deregulation of some aspect of huntingtin's normal function(s), which remains poorly understood. As huntingtin shows evolutionary conservation, a powerful approach to discovering its normal biochemical role(s) is to study the effects caused by its deficiency in a model organism with a short life-cycle that comprises both cellular and multicellular developmental stages. To facilitate studies aimed at detailed knowledge of huntingtin's normal function(s), we generated a null mutant of hd, the HD ortholog in Dictyostelium discoideum. Dictyostelium cells lacking endogenous huntingtin were viable but during development did not exhibit the typical polarized morphology of Dictyostelium cells, streamed poorly to form aggregates by accretion rather than chemotaxis, showed disorganized F-actin staining, exhibited extreme sensitivity to hypoosmotic stress, and failed to form EDTA-resistant cell-cell contacts. Surprisingly, chemotactic streaming could be rescued in the presence of the bivalent cations Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) but not pulses of cAMP. Although hd(-) cells completed development, it was delayed and proceeded asynchronously, producing small fruiting bodies with round, defective spores that germinated spontaneously within a glassy sorus. When developed as chimeras with wild-type cells, hd(-) cells failed to populate the pre-spore region of the slug. In Dictyostelium, huntingtin deficiency is compatible with survival of the organism but renders cells sensitive to low osmolarity, which produces pleiotropic cell autonomous defects that affect cAMP signaling and as a consequence development. Thus, Dictyostelium provides a novel haploid organism model for genetic, cell biological, and biochemical studies to delineate the functions of the HD protein.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis, the guided motion of cells by chemical gradients, plays a crucial role in many biological processes. In the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, chemotaxis is critical for the formation of cell aggregates during starvation. The cells in these aggregates generate a pulse of the chemoattractant, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), every 6 min to 10 min, resulting in surrounding cells moving toward the aggregate. In addition to periodic pulses of cAMP, the cells also secrete phosphodiesterase (PDE), which degrades cAMP and prevents the accumulation of the chemoattractant. Here we show that small aggregates of <i>Dictyostelium</i> can disperse, with cells moving away from instead of toward the aggregate. This surprising behavior often exhibited oscillatory cycles of motion toward and away from the aggregate. Furthermore, the onset of outward cell motion was associated with a doubling of the cAMP signaling period. Computational modeling suggests that this dispersal arises from a competition between secreted cAMP and PDE, creating a cAMP gradient that is directed away from the aggregate, resulting in outward cell motion. The model was able to predict the effect of PDE inhibition as well as global addition of exogenous PDE, and these predictions were subsequently verified in experiments. These results suggest that localized degradation of a chemoattractant is a mechanism for morphogenesis.",

DET1 is largely restricted to multicellular eukaryotes, and here we report the characterization of a DET1 homolog from the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. As in other species, Dictyostelium DET1 is nuclear localized. In contrast to other species, where it is an essential protein, loss of DET1 is nonlethal in Dictyostelium, although viability is significantly reduced. The phenotype of the det1(-) mutant is highly pleiotropic and results in a large degree of heterogeneity in developmental parameters. Loss of DET1 results in delayed and abnormal development with enlarged aggregation territories. Mutant slugs displayed cell type patterning with a bias toward the prestalk pathway. A number of DET1-interacting proteins are conserved in Dictyostelium, and the apparently conserved role of DET1 in regulatory pathways involving the bZIP transcription factors DimB, c-Jun, and HY5 suggests a highly conserved mechanism regulating development in multicellular eukaryotes. While the mechanism by which DET1 functions is unclear, it appears that it has a key role in regulation of developmental plasticity and integration of information on environmental conditions into the developmental program of an organism.",

        "abstract": "Studies of social microbes often focus on one fitness component (reproductive success within the social complex), with little information about or attention to other stages of the life cycle or the ecological context. This can lead to paradoxical results. The life cycle of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum includes a multicellular stage in which not necessarily clonal amoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a possibly chimeric (genetically heterogeneous) fruiting body made of dead stalk cells and spores. The lab-measured reproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism that should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with observations from nature. Two studies have suggested that this inconsistency stems from the one-dimensional assessment of fitness (spore production) and that the solution lies in tradeoffs between multiple life-history traits, e.g.: spore size versus viability; and spore-formation (via aggregation) versus staying vegetative (as non-aggregated cells). We develop an ecologically-grounded, socially-neutral model (i.e. no social interactions between genotypes) for the life cycle of social amoebae in which we theoretically explore multiple non-social life-history traits, tradeoffs and tradeoff-implementing mechanisms. We find that spore production comes at the expense of time to complete aggregation, and, depending on the experimental setup, spore size and viability. Furthermore, experimental results regarding apparent social interactions within chimeric mixes can be qualitatively recapitulated under this neutral hypothesis, without needing to invoke social interactions. This allows for simple potential resolutions to the previously paradoxical results. We conclude that the complexities of life histories, including social behavior and multicellularity, can only be understood in the appropriate multidimensional ecological context, when considering all stages of the life cycle.",

        "abstract": "Developing Dictyostelium cells form aggregation streams that break into groups of approximately 2 x 10(4) cells. The breakup and subsequent group size are regulated by a secreted multisubunit counting factor (CF). To elucidate how CF regulates group size, we isolated second-site suppressors of smlA(-), a transformant that forms small groups due to oversecretion of CF. smlA(-) sslA1(CR11) cells form roughly wild-type-size groups due to an insertion in the beginning of the coding region of sslA1, one of two highly similar genes encoding a novel protein. The insertion increases levels of SslA. In wild-type cells, the sslA1(CR11) mutation forms abnormally large groups. Reducing SslA levels by antisense causes the formation of smaller groups. The sslA(CR11) mutation does not affect the extracellular accumulation of CF activity or the CF components countin and CF50, suggesting that SslA does not regulate CF secretion. However, CF represses levels of SslA. Wild-type cells starved in the presence of smlA(-) cells, recombinant countin, or recombinant CF50 form smaller groups, whereas sslA1(CR11) cells appear to be insensitive to the presence of smlA(-) cells, countin, or CF50, suggesting that the sslA1(CR11) insertion affects CF signal transduction. We previously found that CF reduces intracellular glucose levels. sslA(CR11) does not significantly affect glucose levels, while glucose increases SslA levels. Together, the data suggest that SslA is a novel protein involved in part of a signal transduction pathway regulating group size.",

Are loners incidental byproducts of large-scale coordination attempts, or are they part of a mosaic of life-history strategies? Here, we provide empirical evidence of naturally occurring heritable variation in loner behavior in the model social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We propose that Dictyostelium loners-cells that do not join the multicellular life stage-arise from a dynamic population-partitioning process, the result of each cell making a stochastic, signal-based decision. We find evidence that this imperfectly synchronized multicellular development is affected by both abiotic (environmental porosity) and biotic (signaling) factors. Finally, we predict theoretically that when a pair of strains differing in their partitioning behavior coaggregate, cross-signaling impacts slime-mold diversity across spatiotemporal scales. Our findings suggest that loners could be critical to understanding collective and social behaviors, multicellular development, and ecological dynamics in D. discoideum. More broadly, across taxa, imperfect coordination of collective behaviors might be adaptive by enabling diversification of life-history strategies.",

        "abstract": "Cellular slime molds, including the well-studied Dictyostelium discoideum, are amoebae whose life cycle includes both a single-cellular and a multicellular stage. To achieve the multicellular stage, individual amoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a fruiting body made of dead stalk cells and reproductive spores, a process that has been described in terms of cooperation and altruism. When amoebae aggregate they do not perfectly discriminate against nonkin, leading to chimeric fruiting bodies. Within chimeras, complex interactions among genotypes have been documented, which should theoretically reduce genetic diversity. This is however inconsistent with the great diversity of genotypes found in nature. Recent work has shown that a little-studied component of D. discoideum fitness--the loner cells that do not participate in the aggregation--can be selected for depending on environmental conditions and that, together with the spores, they could represent a bet-hedging strategy. We suggest that in all cellular slime molds the existence of loners could resolve the apparent diversity paradox in two ways. First, if loners are accounted for, then apparent genotypic skew in the spores of chimeras could simply be the result of different investments into spores versus loners. Second, in an ecosystem with multiple local environments differing in their food recovery characteristics and connected globally via weak-to-moderate dispersal, coexistence of multiple genotypes can occur. Finally, we argue that the loners make it impossible to define altruistic behavior, winners or losers, without a clear description of the ecology.",

This is especially challenging for horizontally transferred bacterial symbionts where relationships must be repeatedly established anew. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum farming symbiosis, two species of inedible Burkholderia bacteria (Burkholderia agricolaris and Burkholderia hayleyella) initiate stable associations with naive D. discoideum hosts and cause carriage of additional bacterial species. However, it is not clear how the association between D. discoideum and its carried Burkholderia is formed and maintained. Here, we look at precisely how Burkholderia finds its hosts. We found that both species of Burkholderia clones isolated from D. discoideum, but not other tested Burkholderia species, are attracted to D. discoideum supernatant, showing that the association is not simply the result of haphazard engulfment by the amoebas. The chemotactic responses are affected by both partners. We find evidence that B. hayleyella prefers D. discoideum clones that currently or previously carried Burkholderia, while B. agricolaris does not show this preference. However, we find no evidence of Burkholderia preference for their own host clone or for other hosts of their own species. We further investigate the chemical differences of D. discoideum supernatants that might explain the patterns shown above using a mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach. These results show that these bacterial symbionts are able to preferentially find and to some extent choose their unicellular partners. In addition, this study also suggests that bacteria can actively search for and target phagocytic cells, which may help us better understand how bacteria interact with immune systems.",

Interestingly, two entirely novel classes of RNAs were identified of which one is developmentally regulated. The RNAs within each class share conserved 5'- and 3'-termini that can potentially form stem structures. RNAs of both classes show predominantly cytoplasmic localization. In addition, based on conserved structure and/or sequence motifs, several of the identified ncRNAs could be divided into classes known from other organisms, e.g. 18 small nucleolar RNA candidates (17 box C/D, of which a few are developmentally regulated, and one box H/ACA). Two ncRNAs showed a high degree of similarity to the small nuclear U2 RNA and signal recognition particle RNA (SRP RNA), respectively.

        "abstract": "The evolution of cooperation is a paradox because natural selection should favor exploitative individuals that avoid paying their fair share of any costs. Such conflict between the self-interests of cooperating individuals often results in the evolution of complex, opponent-specific, social strategies and counterstrategies. However, the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying complex social strategies, and therefore the evolution of cooperative behavior, are largely unknown. To address this dearth of empirical data, we combine mathematical modeling, molecular genetic, and developmental approaches to test whether variation in the production of and response to social signals is sufficient to generate the complex partner-specific social success seen in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Firstly, we find that the simple model of production of and response to social signals can generate the sort of apparent complex changes in social behavior seen in this system, without the need for partner recognition. Secondly, measurements of signal production and response in a mutant with a change in a single gene that leads to a shift in social behavior provide support for this model. Finally, these simple measurements of social signaling can also explain complex patterns of variation in social behavior generated by the natural genetic diversity found in isolates collected from the wild. Our studies therefore demonstrate a novel and elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural variation in complex social strategies in D. discoideum. More generally, they suggest that simple rules governing interactions between individuals can be sufficient to generate a diverse array of outcomes that appear complex and unpredictable when those rules are unknown.",

In <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, polyphosphate is used as a secreted signal that inhibits cytokinesis in an autocrine negative feedback loop. To elucidate how cells respond to this unusual signal, we undertook a proteomic analysis of cells treated with physiological levels of polyphosphate and observed that polyphosphate causes cells to decrease levels of actin cytoskeleton proteins, possibly explaining how polyphosphate inhibits cytokinesis. Polyphosphate also causes proteasome protein levels to decrease, and in both <i>Dictyostelium</i> and human leukemia cells, decreases proteasome activity and cell proliferation. Polyphosphate also induces <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells to begin development by increasing expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule CsA (also known as CsaA) and causing aggregation, and this effect, as well as the inhibition of proteasome activity, is mediated by Ras and Akt proteins. Surprisingly, Ras and Akt do not affect the ability of polyphosphate to inhibit proliferation, suggesting that a branching pathway mediates the effects of polyphosphate, with one branch affecting proliferation, and the other branch affecting development.",

        "abstract": "Natural selection should favour generalist predators that outperform specialists across all prey types. Two genetic solutions could explain why intraspecific variation in predatory performance is, nonetheless, widespread: mutations beneficial on one prey type are costly on another (antagonistic pleiotropy), or mutational effects are prey-specific, which weakens selection, allowing variation to persist (relaxed selection). To understand the relative importance of these alternatives, we characterised natural variation in predatory performance in the microbial predator Dictyostelium discoideum. We found widespread nontransitive differences among strains in predatory success across different bacterial prey, which can facilitate stain coexistence in multi-prey environments. To understand the genetic basis, we developed methods for high throughput experimental evolution on different prey (REMI-seq). Most mutations (~77%) had prey-specific effects, with very few (~4%) showing antagonistic pleiotropy. This highlights the potential for prey-specific effects to dilute selection, which would inhibit the purging of variation and prevent the emergence of an optimal generalist predator.",

        "abstract": "Galvanotaxis, or electrotaxis, plays an essential role in wound healing, embryogenesis, and nerve regeneration. Up until now great efforts have been made to identify the underlying mechanism related to galvanotaxis in various cells under direct current electric field (DCEF) in laboratory studies. However, abundant clinical research shows that non-DCEFs including monopolar or bipolar electric field may also contribute to wound healing and regeneration, although the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we designed a novel electric stimulator and applied DCEF, pulsed DCEF (pDCEF), and bipolar pulse electric field (bpEF) to the cells of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. The cells had better directional performance under asymmetric 90% duty cycle pDCEF and 80% duty cycle bpEF compared to DCEF, with 10\u2009Hz frequency electric fields eliciting a better cell response than 5\u2009Hz. Interestingly, electrically neutral 50% duty cycle bpEF triggered the highest migration speed, albeit in random directions. The results suggest that electric pulses are vital to galvanotaxis and non-DCEF is promising in both basic and clinical researches.",

We present genetic evidence that the misspecification of cell types seen in mutants of the serine protease/ABC transporter TagA results from the loss of normal interactions with AcbA. Developmental phenotypes resulting from aberrant expression of the TagA protease domain, such as the formation of supernumerary tips on aggregates and the production of excess prestalk cells, are suppressed by null mutations in the acbA gene. Phenotypes resulting from the deletion of tagA, such as overexpression of the prestalk gene ecmB and the misexpression of the prespore gene cotB in stalk cells, are also observed in acbA mutants. Moreover, tagA- mutants fail to produce SDF-2 during fruiting body morphogenesis but are able to do so if they are stimulated with exogenous SDF-2. These results indicate that the developmental program depends on TagA and AcbA working in concert with each other during cell type differentiation and suggest that TagA is required for normal SDF-2 signaling during spore encapsulation.",

        "abstract": "Much remains to be understood about how a group of cells or a tissue senses and regulates its size. Dictyostelium discoideum cells sense and regulate the size of groups and fruiting bodies using a secreted 450-kDa complex of proteins called counting factor (CF). Low levels of CF result in large groups, and high levels of CF result in small groups. We previously found three components of CF (D. A. Brock and R. H. Gomer, Genes Dev. 13:1960-1969, 1999; D. A. Brock, R. D. Hatton, D.-V. Giurgiutiu, B. Scott, R. Ammann, and R. H. Gomer, Development 129:3657-3668, 2002; and D. A. Brock, R. D. Hatton, D.-V. Giurgiutiu, B. Scott, W. Jang, R. Ammann, and R. H. Gomer, Eukaryot. Cell 2:788-797, 2003). We describe here a fourth component, CF60. CF60 has similarity to acid phosphatases, although it has very little, if any, acid phosphatase activity. CF60 is secreted by starving cells and is lost from the 450-kDa CF when a different CF component, CF50, is absent. Although we were unable to obtain cells lacking CF60, decreasing CF60 levels by antisense resulted in large groups, and overexpressing CF60 resulted in small groups. When added to wild-type cells, conditioned starvation medium from CF60 overexpressor cells as well as recombinant CF60 caused the formation of small groups. The ability of recombinant CF60 to decrease group size did not require the presence of the CF component CF45-1 or countin but did require the presence of CF50. Recombinant CF60 does not have acid phosphatase activity, indicating that the CF60 bioactivity is not due to a phosphatase activity. Together, the data suggest that CF60 is a component of CF, and thus this secreted signal has four different protein components.",

Here, we examine the dynamics of cytokinesis by using a combination of microscopy, dynamic measurements, and genetic analysis. We find that cytokinesis proceeds through a single sequence of shape changes, but the kinetics of the transformation from one shape to another differs dramatically between strains. We interpret the measurements in a simple and quantitative manner by using a previously uncharacterized analytic model. From the analysis, wild-type cytokinesis appears to proceed through an active, extremely regulated process in which globally distributed proteins generate resistive forces that slow the rate of furrow ingression. Finally, we propose that, in addition to myosin II, a Laplace pressure, resulting from material properties and the geometry of the dividing cell, generates force to help drive furrow ingression late in cytokinesis.",

In order to determine whether these transcripts could possibly derive from processing of even larger transcripts, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) were performed in an attempt to amplify the intervening regions between the eight major transcripts. All but one intervening region were successfully reverse transcribed and amplified, indicating that even larger transcripts existed and that the eight major transcripts detected previously may be the products of transcript processing. Southern hybridization analyses of DNA fragments representing the sequences between the eight major transcripts with in vitro capped mitochondrial RNA identified the 5' end of only one of the eight major transcripts as a genuine transcription start site. The ability to initiate transcription from DNA sequences upstream of the identified transcription initiation site was demonstrated in bacterial cells expressing the Dictyostelium mitochondrial RNA polymerase. We conclude that transcription of the Dictyostelium mitochondrial genome is initiated at a single site, generating a large polycistronic transcript that is very efficiently, probably cotranscriptionally processed into mature RNA species. This is the first report on a protist mitochondrial DNA that is, although much larger in size than its metazoan counterparts, transcribed from a single transcription initiation site.",

Multiple prior studies have implicated the patterning of focal adhesions in contact guidance. However, we observe significant contact guidance of Dictyostelium along surfaces with nanoscale ridges or grooves, even though this organism lacks integrin-based adhesions. Cells that move parallel to nanoridges are faster, more protrusive at their fronts, and more elongated than are cells that move perpendicular to nanoridges. Quantitative studies show that nanoridges spaced 1.5 \u03bcm apart exhibit the greatest contact guidance efficiency. Because Dictyostelium cells exhibit oscillatory shape dynamics, we model contact guidance as a process in which stochastic cellular harmonic oscillators couple to the periodicity of the nanoridges. In support of this connection, we find that nanoridges nucleate actin polymerization waves of nanoscale width that propagate parallel to the nanoridges.",

They exist within a high-molecular-weight complex that reversibly inhibits cell proliferation, but not growth, via cell surface receptors and a signaling pathway that includes G proteins. How the production of these two proteins is regulated is unknown. Dictyostelium cells possess three GCN2-type eukaryotic initiation factor 2 \u03b1 subunit (eIF2\u03b1) kinases, proteins that phosphorylate the translational initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 and possess a tRNA binding domain involved in their regulation. The Dictyostelium kinases have been shown to function during development in regulating several processes. We show here that expression of an unregulated, activated kinase domain greatly inhibits cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect on proliferation is not due to a general inhibition of translation. Instead, it is due to enhanced production of a secreted factor(s). Indeed, extracellular CfaD and AprA proteins, but not their mRNAs, are overproduced in cells expressing the activated kinase domain. The inhibition of proliferation is not seen when the activated kinase domain is expressed in cells lacking CfaD or AprA or in cells that contain a nonphosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1. We conclude that production of the chalones CfaD and AprA is translationally regulated by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Both proteins are upregulated at the culmination of development, and this enhanced production is lacking in a strain that possesses a nonphosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in either of two presenilin genes can cause familial Alzheimer's disease. Presenilins have both proteolysis-dependent functions, as components of the \u03b3-secretase complex, and proteolysis-independent functions in signalling. In this study, we investigate a conserved function of human presenilins in the development of the simple model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. We show that the block in Dictyostelium development caused by the ablation of both Dictyostelium presenilins is rescued by the expression of human presenilin 1, restoring the terminal differentiation of multiple cell types. This developmental role is independent of proteolytic activity, because the mutation of both catalytic aspartates does not affect presenilin ability to rescue development, and the ablation of nicastrin, a \u03b3-secretase component that is crucial for proteolytic activity, does not block development. The role of presenilins during Dictyostelium development is therefore independent of their proteolytic activity. However, presenilin loss in Dictyostelium results in elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and enhanced stimulation-induced calcium release, suggesting that presenilins regulate these intracellular signalling pathways. Our data suggest that presenilin proteins perform an ancient non-proteolytic role in regulating intracellular signalling and development, and that Dictyostelium is a useful model for analysing human presenilin function.",

To decipher this collective process, we combined two technological developments: porphyrin-based O<sub>2</sub> -sensing films and microfluidic O<sub>2</sub> gradient generators. We showed that <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells exhibit aerotactic and aerokinetic response in a low range of O<sub>2</sub> concentration indicative of a very efficient detection mechanism. Cell behaviors under self-generated or imposed O<sub>2</sub> gradients were modeled using an in silico cellular Potts model built on experimental observations. This computational model was complemented with a parsimonious 'Go or Grow' partial differential equation (PDE) model. In both models, we found that the collective migration of a dense ring can be explained by the interplay between cell division and the modulation of aerotaxis.",

In an intricate process governed by the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system and a plethora of effector proteins, the nascent LCV interferes with a number of intracellular trafficking pathways, including retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. Conserved retrograde trafficking components, such as the retromer coat complex or the phosphoinositide (PI) 5-phosphatase <i>D. discoideum</i> 5-phosphatase 4 (Dd5P4)/oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL), restrict intracellular replication of <i>L. pneumophila</i> by an unknown mechanism.

The actin-nucleating protein and retromer interactor WASH (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein [WASP] and suppressor of cAMP receptor [SCAR] homologue) promotes the accumulation of Rab1 and Rab8 on LCVs. Collectively, our findings validate IFC for the quantitative and unbiased analysis of the pathogen vacuole composition and reveal the impact of retrograde-linked PI metabolism and actin dynamics on the LCV composition.

        "abstract": "Initial immunological defense mechanisms to pathogen invasion rely on innate pathways of chemotaxis and phagocytosis, original to ancient phagocytes. Although chemotaxis has been well-studied in mammalian and model systems using purified chemoattractants in defined conditions, directed movement toward live bacteria has been more difficult to assess. <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> is a professional phagocyte that chemotaxes toward bacteria during growth-phase in a process to locate nutrient sources. Using <i>Dictyostelium</i> as a model, we have developed a system that is able to quantify chemotaxis to very high sensitivity. Here, <i>Dictyostelium</i> can detect various chemoattractants at concentrations <1 nM. Given this exceedingly sensitive signal response, <i>Dictyostelium</i> will migrate directionally toward live gram positive and gram negative bacteria, in a highly quantifiable manner, and dependent upon bacterially-secreted chemoattractants. Additionally, we have developed a real-time, quantitative assay for phagocytosis of live gram positive and gram negative bacteria. To extend the analyses of endocytic functions, we further modified the system to quantify cellular uptake <i>via</i> macropinocytosis of smaller (<100 kDa) molecules. These various approaches provide novel means to dissect potential for identification of novel chemoattractants and mechanistic factors that are essential for chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and/or macropinocytosis and for more detailed understanding in host-pathogen interactive defenses.",

        "abstract": "Biological cells are often found to sense their chemical environment near the single-molecule detection limit. Surprisingly, this precision is higher than simple estimates of the fundamental physical limit, hinting towards active sensing strategies. In this work, we analyse the effect of cell memory, e.g. from slow biochemical processes, on the precision of sensing by cell-surface receptors. We derive analytical formulas, which show that memory significantly improves sensing in weakly fluctuating environments. However, surprisingly when memory is adjusted dynamically, the precision is always improved, even in strongly fluctuating environments. In support of this prediction we quantify the directional biases in chemotactic Dictyostelium discoideum cells in a flow chamber with alternating chemical gradients. The strong similarities between cell sensing and control engineering suggest universal problem-solving strategies of living matter.",

        "abstract": "By generating a population of Dictyostelium cells that are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle we have examined the influence of cell cycle status on cell fate specification, cell type proportioning and its regulation, and terminal differentiation. The lack of observable mitosis during the development of these cells and the quantification of their cellular DNA content suggests that they remain in G1 throughout development. Furthermore, chromosomal DNA synthesis was not detectable these cells, indicating that no synthesis phase had occurred, although substantial mitochondrial DNA synthesis did occur in prespore cells. The G1-phase cells underwent normal morphological development and sporulation but displayed an elevated prespore/prestalk ratio of 5.7 compared to the 3.0 (or 3:1) ratio normally observed in populations dominated by G2-phase cells. When migrating slugs produced by G1-phase cells were bisected, each half could reestablish the 5.7 (or 5.7:1) prespore/prestalk ratio. These results demonstrate that Dictyostelium cells can carry out the entire developmental cycle in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and that passage from G2 into G1 phase is not required for sporulation. Our results also suggest that the population asymmetry provided by the distribution of cells around the cell cycle at the time of starvation is not strictly required for cell type proportioning. Finally, when developed together with G2-phase cells, G1-phase cells preferentially become prespore cells and exclude G2-phase cells from the prespore-spore cell population, suggesting that G1-phase cells have an advantage over G2-phase cells in executing the spore cell differentiation pathway.",

        "abstract": "The SCAR/WAVE complex drives actin-based protrusion, cell migration, and cell separation during cytokinesis. However, the contribution of the individual complex members to the activity of the whole remains a mystery. This is primarily because complex members depend on one another for stability, which limits the scope for experimental manipulation. Several studies suggest that Abi, a relatively small complex member, connects signaling to SCAR/WAVE complex localization and activation through its polyproline C-terminal tail. We generated a deletion series of the Dictyostelium discoideum Abi to investigate its exact role in regulation of the SCAR complex and identified a minimal fragment that would stabilize the complex. Surprisingly, loss of either the N terminus of Abi or the C-terminal polyproline tail conferred no detectable defect in complex recruitment to the leading edge or the formation of pseudopods. A fragment containing approximately 20% Abi--and none of the sites that couple to known signaling pathways--allowed the SCAR complex to function with normal localization and kinetics. However, expression of N-terminal Abi deletions exacerbated the cytokinesis defect of the Dictyostelium abi mutant, which was earlier shown to be caused by the inappropriate activation of SCAR. This demonstrates, unexpectedly, that Abi does not mediate the SCAR complex's ability to make pseudopods, beyond its role in complex stability. Instead, we propose that Abi has a modulatory role when the SCAR complex is activated through other mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In both randomly moving Dictyostelium and mammalian cells, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and F-actin are known to propagate as waves at the membrane and act to push out the protruding edge. To date, however, the relationship between the wave geometry and the patterns of amoeboid shape change remains elusive. Here, by using phase map analysis, we show that morphology dynamics of randomly moving Dictyostelium discoideum cells can be characterized by the number, topology, and position of spatial phase singularities, i.e., points that represent organizing centers of rotating waves. A single isolated singularity near the cellular edge induced a rotational protrusion, whereas a pair of singularities supported a symmetric extension. These singularities appeared by strong phase resetting due to de novo nucleation at the back of preexisting waves. Analysis of a theoretical model indicated excitability of the system that is governed by positive feedback from phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate to PI3-kinase activation, and we showed experimentally that this requires F-actin. Furthermore, by incorporating membrane deformation into the model, we demonstrated that geometries of competing waves explain most of the observed semiperiodic changes in amoeboid morphology.",

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the proteic content of MLBs. The lipid composition of MLBs is mainly amoebal in origin, suggesting that MLB formation is a protozoa-driven process that could play a significant role in amoebal physiology. We identified four major proteins on purified MLBs using mass spectrometry in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms governing MLB formation and, eventually, to elucidate the true function of MLBs. These proteins were SctA, PhoPQ, PonC and a protein containing a cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase (CDD) zinc-binding region. SctA is a component of pycnosomes, which are membranous materials that are continuously secreted by amoebae. The presence of SctA on MLBs was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting using a specific anti-SctA antibody. The CDD protein may be one of the proteins recognized by the H36 antibody, which was used as a MLB marker in a previous study. The function of the CDD protein is unknown. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses confirmed that the H36 antibody is a better marker of MLBs than the anti-SctA antibody. This study is an additional step to elucidate the potential role of MLBs and revealed that only a small set of proteins appeared to be present on MLBs.",

        "abstract": "Oxidation of halides and thiocyanate by heme peroxidases to antimicrobial oxidants is an important cornerstone in the innate immune system of mammals. Interestingly, phylogenetic and physiological studies suggest that homologous peroxidases are already present in mycetozoan eukaryotes such as <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> This social amoeba kills bacteria via phagocytosis for nutrient acquisition at its single-cell stage and for antibacterial defense at its multicellular stages. Here, we demonstrate that peroxidase A from <i>D. discoideum</i> (DdPoxA) is a stable, monomeric, glycosylated, and secreted heme peroxidase with homology to mammalian peroxidases. The first crystal structure (2.5 \u00c5 resolution) of a mycetozoan peroxidase of this superfamily shows the presence of a post-translationally-modified heme with one single covalent ester bond between the 1-methyl heme substituent and Glu-236. The metalloprotein follows the halogenation cycle, whereby compound I oxidizes iodide and thiocyanate at high rates (>10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and bromide at very low rates. It is demonstrated that DdPoxA is up-regulated and likely secreted at late multicellular development stages of <i>D. discoideum</i> when migrating slugs differentiate into fruiting bodies that contain persistent spores on top of a cellular stalk. Expression of DdPoxA is shown to restrict bacterial contamination of fruiting bodies. Structure and function of DdPoxA are compared with evolutionary-related mammalian peroxidases in the context of non-specific immune defense.",

Dictyostelium cells exhibit kin discrimination--a potential defense against cheaters, which sporulate without contributing to the stalk. Kin discrimination depends on strain relatedness, and the polymorphic genes tgrB1 and tgrC1 are potential components of that mechanism. Here, we demonstrate a direct role for these genes in kin discrimination. We show that a matching pair of tgrB1 and tgrC1 alleles is necessary and sufficient for attractive self-recognition, which is mediated by differential cell-cell adhesion. We propose that TgrB1 and TgrC1 proteins mediate this adhesion through direct binding. This system is a genetically tractable ancient model of eukaryotic self-recognition.",

        "abstract": "Establishment of multicellularity represents a major transition in eukaryote evolution. A subgroup of Amoebozoa, the dictyosteliids, has evolved a relatively simple aggregative multicellular stage resulting in a fruiting body supported by a stalk. Protosteloid amoeba, which are scattered throughout the amoebozoan tree, differ by producing only one or few single stalked spores. Thus, one obvious difference in the developmental cycle of protosteliids and dictyosteliids seems to be the establishment of multicellularity. To separate spore development from multicellular interactions, we compared the genome and transcriptome of a Protostelium species (Protostelium aurantium var. fungivorum) with those of social and solitary members of the Amoebozoa. During fruiting body formation nearly 4,000 genes, corresponding to specific pathways required for differentiation processes, are upregulated. A comparison with genes involved in the development of dictyosteliids revealed conservation of >500 genes, but most of them are also present in Acanthamoeba castellanii for which fruiting bodies have not been documented. Moreover, expression regulation of those genes differs between P. aurantium and Dictyostelium discoideum. Within Amoebozoa differentiation to fruiting bodies is common, but our current genome analysis suggests that protosteliids and dictyosteliids used different routes to achieve this. Most remarkable is both the large repertoire and diversity between species in genes that mediate environmental sensing and signal processing. This likely reflects an immense adaptability of the single cell stage to varying environmental conditions. We surmise that this signaling repertoire provided sufficient building blocks to accommodate the relatively simple demands for cell-cell communication in the early multicellular forms.",

        "abstract": "We recently isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum cells a DNA-binding protein, CbfA, that interacts in vitro with a regulatory element in retrotransposon TRE5-A. We have generated a mutant strain that expresses CbfA at <5% of the wild-type level to characterize the consequences for D. discoideum cell physiology. We found that the multicellular development program leading to fruiting body formation is highly compromised in the mutant. The cells cannot aggregate and stay as a monolayer almost indefinitely. The cells respond properly to prestarvation conditions by expressing discoidin in a cell density-dependent manner. A genomewide microarray-assisted expression analysis combined with Northern blot analyses revealed a failure of CbfA-depleted cells to induce the gene encoding aggregation-specific adenylyl cyclase ACA and other genes required for cyclic AMP (cAMP) signal relay, which is necessary for aggregation and subsequent multicellular development. However, the cbfA mutant aggregated efficiently when mixed with as few as 5% wild-type cells. Moreover, pulsing cbfA mutant cells developing in suspension with nanomolar levels of cAMP resulted in induction of acaA and other early developmental genes. Although the response was less efficient and slower than in wild-type cells, it showed that cells depleted of CbfA are able to initiate development if given exogenous cAMP signals. Ectopic expression of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A restored multicellular development of the mutant. We conclude that sensing of cell density and starvation are independent of CbfA, whereas CbfA is essential for the pattern of gene expression which establishes the genetic network leading to aggregation and multicellular development of D. discoideum.",

        "abstract": "Spontaneous mutations play a central role in evolution. Despite their importance, mutation rates are some of the most elusive parameters to measure in evolutionary biology. The combination of mutation accumulation (MA) experiments and whole-genome sequencing now makes it possible to estimate mutation rates by directly observing new mutations at the molecular level across the whole genome. We performed an MA experiment with the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and sequenced the genomes of three randomly chosen lines using high-throughput sequencing to estimate the spontaneous mutation rate in this model organism. The mitochondrial mutation rate of 6.76\u00d710(-9), with a Poisson confidence interval of 4.1\u00d710(-9) - 9.5\u00d710(-9), per nucleotide per generation is slightly lower than estimates for other taxa. The mutation rate estimate for the nuclear DNA of 2.9\u00d710(-11), with a Poisson confidence interval ranging from 7.4\u00d710(-13) to 1.6\u00d710(-10), is the lowest reported for any eukaryote. These results are consistent with low microsatellite mutation rates previously observed in D. discoideum and low levels of genetic variation observed in wild D. discoideum populations. In addition, D. discoideum has been shown to be quite resistant to DNA damage, which suggests an efficient DNA-repair mechanism that could be an adaptation to life in soil and frequent exposure to intracellular and extracellular mutagenic compounds. The social aspect of the life cycle of D. discoideum and a large portion of the genome under relaxed selection during vegetative growth could also select for a low mutation rate. This hypothesis is supported by a significantly lower mutation rate per cell division in multicellular eukaryotes compared with unicellular eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "The highly conserved enzyme arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (Ate1) mediates arginylation, a posttranslational modification that is only incompletely understood at its molecular level. To investigate whether arginylation affects actin-dependent processes in a simple model organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, we knocked out the gene encoding Ate1 and characterized the phenotype of ate1-null cells. Visualization of actin cytoskeleton dynamics by live-cell microscopy indicated significant changes in comparison to wild-type cells. Ate1-null cells were almost completely lacking focal actin adhesion sites at the substrate-attached surface and were only weakly adhesive. In two-dimensional chemotaxis assays toward folate or cAMP, the motility of ate1-null cells was increased. However, in three-dimensional chemotaxis involving more confined conditions, the motility of ate1-null cells was significantly reduced. Live-cell imaging showed that GFP-tagged Ate1 rapidly relocates to sites of newly formed actin-rich protrusions. By mass spectrometric analysis, we identified four arginylation sites in the most abundant actin isoform of Dictyostelium, in addition to arginylation sites in other actin isoforms and several actin-binding proteins. In vitro polymerization assays with actin purified from ate1-null cells revealed a diminished polymerization capacity in comparison to wild-type actin. Our data indicate that arginylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of cytoskeletal activities.",

However, intrinsic and acquired resistance presents a major problem. Treatment of cells with hydroxamates such as trichostatin A (TSA) leads to rapid preferential acetylation of histone H3 already trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3), although the importance of this H3K4me3-directed acetylation in the biological consequences of KDACi treatment is not known. We address this utilizing Dictyostelium discoideum strains lacking H3K4me3 due to disruption of the gene encoding the Set1 methyltransferase or mutations in endogenous H3 genes. Loss of H3K4me3 confers resistance to TSA-induced developmental inhibition and delays accumulation of H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac. H3K4me3-directed H3Ac is mediated by Sgf29, a subunit of the SAGA acetyltransferase complex that interacts with H3K4me3 via a tandem tudor domain (TTD). We identify an Sgf29 orthologue in Dictyostelium with a TTD that specifically recognizes the H3K4me3 modification. Disruption of the gene encoding Sgf29 delays accumulation of H3K9Ac and abrogates H3K4me3-directed H3Ac. Either loss or overexpression of Sgf29 confers developmental resistance to TSA. Our results demonstrate that rapid acetylation of H3K4me3 histones regulates developmental sensitivity to TSA. Levels of H3K4me3 or Sgf29 will provide useful biomarkers for sensitivity to this class of chemotherapeutic drug.",

The phenotypes of PHG1a, PHG1b, and PHG1a/PHG1b double knockout cells revealed that Phg1a and Phg1b proteins play a synergistic but not redundant role in cellular adhesion, phagocytosis, growth, and development. Complementation analysis supports a synergistic regulatory function rather than a receptor role for Phg1a and Phg1b proteins. Together, these results suggest that Phg1 proteins act as regulators of cellular adhesion, possibly by controlling the intracellular transport in the endocytic pathway and the composition of the cell surface.",

        "abstract": "The loss of function of DJ-1 caused by mutations in <i>DJ1</i> causes a form of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the role of DJ-1 in healthy and in PD cells is poorly understood. Even its subcellular localization in mammalian cells is uncertain, with both cytosolic and mitochondrial locations having been reported. We show here that DJ-1 is normally located in the cytoplasm in healthy <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells. With its unique life cycle, straightforward genotype-phenotype relationships, experimental accessibility and genetic tractability, <i>D.</i><i>discoideum</i> offers an attractive model to investigate the roles of PD-associated genes. Furthermore, the study of mitochondrial biology, mitochondrial genome transcription and AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated cytopathologies in mitochondrial dysfunction have been well developed in this organism. Unlike mammalian systems, <i>Dictyostelium</i> mitochondrial dysfunction causes a reproducible and readily assayed array of aberrant phenotypes: defective phototaxis, impaired growth, normal rates of endocytosis and characteristic defects in multicellular morphogenesis. This makes it possible to study whether the underlying cytopathological mechanisms of familial PD involve mitochondrial dysfunction. DJ-1 has a single homologue in the <i>Dictyostelium</i> genome. By regulating the expression level of DJ-1 in <i>D. discoideum</i>, we show here that in unstressed cells, DJ-1 is required for normal rates of endocytic nutrient uptake (phagocytosis and, to a lesser extent, pinocytosis) and thus growth. Reduced expression of DJ-1 had no effect on phototaxis in the multicellular migratory 'slug' stage of the life cycle, but resulted in thickened stalks in the final fruiting bodies. This pattern of phenotypes is distinct from that observed in <i>Dictyostelium</i> to result from mitochondrial dyfunction. Direct measurement of mitochondrial respiratory function in intact cells revealed that DJ-1 knockdown stimulates whereas DJ-1 overexpression inhibits mitochondrial activity. Together, our results suggest positive roles for DJ-1 in endocytic pathways and loss-of-function cytopathologies that are not associated with impaired mitochondrial function.",

In this study, we found that genetic inactivation of the TM9 protein Phg1A dramatically decreases the surface levels of the SibA adhesion molecule in Dictyostelium amoebae. This is due to a decrease in sibA mRNA levels, in SibA protein stability, and in SibA targeting to the cell surface. A similar phenotype was observed in cells devoid of SadA, a protein that does not belong to the TM9 family but also exhibits nine transmembrane domains and is essential for cellular adhesion. A contact site A (csA)-SibA chimeric protein comprising only the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of SibA and the extracellular domain of the Dictyostelium surface protein csA also showed reduced stability and relocalization to endocytic compartments in phg1A knockout cells. These results indicate that TM9 proteins participate in cell adhesion by controlling the levels of adhesion proteins present at the cell surface.",

        "abstract": "The spore coat of Dictyostelium is formed de novo from proteins secreted from vesicles and cellulose synthesized across the plasma membrane as differentiating spores rise up the stalk. The mechanism by which these events are coordinated is not understood. In the course of experiments designed to test the function of the inner layer coat protein SP85 (PsB), expression of a specific partial length fragment was found to interrupt coat assembly after protein secretion and prior to cellulose synthesis in 85% of the cells. This fragment consisted of SP85's N-terminal domain, containing prespore vesicle targeting information, and its Cys-rich C1 domain. The effect of the NC1 fusion was not cell autonomous in interstrain chimeras, suggesting that it acted at the cell surface. SP85-null spores presented an opposite phenotype in which spores differentiated prematurely before reaching the top of the stalk, and cellulose was slightly overproduced in a disorganized fashion. A similar though less severe phenotype occurred when a fusion of the N and C2 domains was expressed. In a double mutant, absence of SP85 was epistatic to NC1 expression, suggesting that NC1 inhibited SP85 function. Together, these results suggest the existence of an outside-in signaling pathway that constitutes a checkpoint to ensure that cellulose synthesis does not occur until coat proteins are properly organized at the cell surface and stalk formation is complete. Checkpoint execution is proposed to be regulated by SP85, which is in turn under the influence of other coat proteins that interact with SP85 via its C1 and C2 domains.",

        "abstract": "Copines are calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins found in many eukaryotic organisms. We are studying the function of copines using the model organism, Dictyostelium discoideum. When under starvation conditions, Dictyostelium cells aggregate into mounds that become migrating slugs, which can move toward light and heat before culminating into a fruiting body. Previously, we showed that Dictyostelium cells lacking the copine A (cpnA) gene are not able to form fruiting bodies and instead arrest at the slug stage. In this study, we compared the slug behavior of cells lacking the cpnA gene to the slug behavior of wild-type cells. The slugs formed by cpnA- cells were much larger than wild-type slugs and exhibited no phototaxis and negative thermotaxis in the same conditions that wild-type slugs exhibited positive phototaxis and thermotaxis. Mixing as little as 5% wild-type cells with cpnA- cells rescued the phototaxis and thermotaxis defects, suggesting that CpnA plays a specific role in the regulation of the production and/or release of a signaling molecule. Reducing extracellular levels of ammonia also partially rescued the phototaxis and thermotaxis defects of cpnA- slugs, suggesting that CpnA may have a specific role in regulating ammonia signaling. Expressing the lacZ gene under the cpnA promoter in wild-type cells indicated cpnA is preferentially expressed in the prestalk cells found in the anterior part of the slug, which include the cells at the tip of the slug that regulate phototaxis, thermotaxis, and the initiation of culmination into fruiting bodies. Our results suggest that CpnA plays a role in the regulation of the signaling pathways, including ammonia signaling, necessary for sensing and/or orienting toward light and heat in the prestalk cells of the Dictyostelium slug.",

Traditionally, DART testing has been conducted in vivo in mammalian model systems. New legislation aimed at reducing animal use and the prohibitive costs associated with DART testing, together with a need to understand the genetic pathways underlying developmental toxicity means there is a growing demand for alternative model systems for toxicity evaluation. Here we explore the potential of the eukaryotic social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which is already widely used as a simple model system for cell and developmental biology, as a potential nonanimal model for DART testing. We developed assays for high-throughput screening of toxicity during D. discoideum growth and development. This allowed the toxicity of a broad range of test compounds to be characterized, which revealed that D. discoideum can broadly predict mammalian toxicity. In addition, we show that this system can be used to perform functional genomic screens to compare the molecular modes of action of different compounds. For example, genome-wide screens for mutations that affect lithium and valproic acid toxicity allowed common and unique biological targets and molecular processes mediating their toxicity to be identified. These studies illustrate that D. discoideum could represent a predictive nonanimal model for DART testing due to its amenability to high-throughput approaches and molecular genetic tractability.",

        "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), commonly known as Batten disease, belong to a family of neurological disorders that cause blindness, seizures, loss of motor function and cognitive ability, and premature death. There are 13 different subtypes of NCL that are associated with mutations in 13 genetically distinct genes (CLN1-CLN8, CLN10-CLN14). Similar clinical and pathological profiles of the different NCL subtypes suggest that common disease mechanisms may be involved. As a result, there have been many efforts to determine how NCL proteins are connected at the cellular level. A main driving force for NCL research has been the utilization of mammalian and non-mammalian cellular models to study the mechanisms underlying the disease. One non-mammalian model that has provided significant insight into NCL protein function is the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Accumulated data from Dictyostelium and mammalian cells show that NCL proteins display similar localizations, have common binding partners, and regulate the expression and activities of one another. In addition, genetic models of NCL display similar phenotypes. This review integrates findings from Dictyostelium and mammalian models of NCL to highlight our understanding of the molecular networking of NCL proteins. The goal here is to help set the stage for future work to reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying the NCLs.",

In the cytoplasm, the contractility machinery organizes into higher order assemblies termed contractility kits (CKs). Using Dictyostelium discoideum, we previously identified Discoidin I (DscI), a classic secreted lectin, as a CK component through its physical interactions with the actin crosslinker Cortexillin I (CortI) and the scaffolding protein IQGAP2. Here, we find that DscI ensures robust cytokinesis through regulating intracellular components of the contractile machinery. Specifically, DscI is necessary for normal cytokinesis, cortical tension, membrane-cortex connections, and cortical distribution and mechanoresponsiveness of CortI. The dscI deletion mutants also have complex genetic epistatic relationships with CK components, acting as a genetic suppressor of cortI and iqgap1, but as an enhancer of iqgap2. This work underscores the fact that proteins like DiscI contribute in diverse ways to the activities necessary for optimal cell function.",

While there are many histidine kinases, there is only a single response regulator, RegA. Not surprisingly given the ubiquitous involvement of cAMP in numerous processes of development in Dictyostelium, RegA is a cAMP phosphodiesterase that is activated upon receiving phosphates through a phosphorelay.

In this study, we expressed humanized cDNAs of P2XA, P2XB, P2XC, P2XD, and P2XE in human embryonic kidney cells and altered the ionic and proton environment in an attempt to reflect the situation in amoeba. Recording of whole-cell membrane currents showed that four receptors operated as ATP-gated channels (P2XA, P2XB, P2XD, and P2XE). At P2XA receptors, ATP was the only effective agonist of 17 structurally related putative ligands that were tested. Extracellular sodium, compared with potassium, strongly inhibited ATP responses in P2XB, P2XD, and P2XE receptors. Increasing the proton concentration (pH 6.2) accelerated desensitization at P2XA receptors and decreased currents at P2XD receptors, but increased the currents at P2XB and P2XE receptors. Dictyostelium lacking P2XA receptors showed impaired regulatory volume decrease in hypotonic solution. This phenotype was readily rescued by overexpression of P2XA and P2XD receptors, partially rescued by P2XB and P2XE receptors, and not rescued by P2XC receptors. The failure of the nonfunctional receptor P2XC to restore the regulatory volume decrease highlights the importance of ATP activation of P2X receptors for a normal response to hypo-osmotic shock, and the weak rescue by P2XB and P2XE receptors indicates that there is limited functional redundancy among Dictyostelium P2X receptors.",

        "abstract": "Botanicals are widely used as dietary supplements and for the prevention and treatment of disease. Despite a long history of use, there is generally little evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these preparations. Curcumin has been used to treat a myriad of human diseases and is widely advertised and marketed for its ability to improve health, but there is no clear understanding how curcumin interacts with cells and affects cell physiology. D. discoideum is a simple eukaryotic lead system that allows both tractable genetic and biochemical studies. The studies reported here show novel effects of curcumin on cell proliferation and physiology, and a pleiotropic effect on gene transcription. Transcriptome analysis showed that the effect is two-phased with an early transient effect on the transcription of approximately 5% of the genome, and demonstrates that cells respond to curcumin through a variety of previously unknown molecular pathways. This is followed by later unique transcriptional changes and a protein kinase A dependent decrease in catalase A and three superoxide dismutase enzymes. Although this results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide and H2O2), the effects of curcumin on transcription do not appear to be the direct result of oxidation. This study opens the door to future explorations of the effect of curcumin on cell physiology.",

When developed in shaken suspension, 125 of these genes were expressed if the cells were treated with cyclic AMP (cAMP) pulses at 6-min intervals between 2 and 6 h of development followed by high levels of exogenous cAMP. In the absence of cAMP treatment, only three genes, carA, gbaB, and pdsA, were consistently expressed. Surprisingly, 14 other genes were induced by cAMP treatment of mutant cells lacking the activatable adenylyl cyclase, ACA. However, these genes were not cAMP induced if both of the developmental adenylyl cyclases, ACA and ACR, were disrupted, showing that they depend on an internal source of cAMP. Constitutive activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA was found to bypass the requirement of these genes for adenylyl cyclase and cAMP pulses, demonstrating the critical role of PKA in transducing the cAMP signal to early gene expression. In the absence of constitutive PKA activity, expression of later genes was strictly dependent on ACA in pulsed cells.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular Ca(++), a ubiquitous cation in the soluble environment of cells both free living and within the human body, regulates most aspects of amoeboid cell motility, including shape, uropod formation, pseudopod formation, velocity, and turning in Dictyostelium discoideum. Hence it affects the efficiency of both basic motile behavior and chemotaxis. Extracellular Ca(++) is optimal at 10 mM. A gradient of the chemoattractant cAMP generated in the absence of added Ca(++) only affects turning, but in combination with extracellular Ca(++), enhances the effects of extracellular Ca(++). Potassium, at 40 mM, can partially substitute for Ca(++). Mg(++), Mn(++), Zn(++), and Na(+) cannot. Extracellular Ca(++), or K(+), also induce the cortical localization of myosin II in a polar fashion. The effects of Ca(++), K(+) or a cAMP gradient do not appear to be similarly mediated by an increase in the general pool of free cytosolic Ca(++). These results suggest a model, in which each agent functioning through different signaling systems, converge to affect the cortical localization of myosin II, which in turn effects the behavioral changes leading to efficient cell motility and chemotaxis.

        "abstract": "Kinesins are a diverse superfamily of motor proteins that drive organelles and other microtubule-based movements in eukaryotic cells. These motors play important roles in multiple events during both interphase and cell division. Dictyostelium discoideum contains 13 kinesin motors, 12 of which are grouped into nine families, plus one orphan. Functions for 11 of the 13 motors have been previously investigated; we address here the activities of the two remaining kinesins, both isoforms with central motor domains. Kif6 (of the kinesin-13 family) appears to be essential for cell viability. The partial knockdown of Kif6 with RNA interference generates mitotic defects (lagging chromosomes and aberrant spindle assemblies) that are consistent with kinesin-13 disruptions in other organisms. However, the orphan motor Kif9 participates in a completely novel kinesin activity, one that maintains a connection between the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and nucleus during interphase. kif9 null cell growth is impaired, and the MTOC appears to disconnect from its normally tight nuclear linkage. Mitotic spindles elongate in a normal fashion in kif9(-) cells, but we hypothesize that this kinesin is important for positioning the MTOC into the nuclear envelope during prophase. This function would be significant for the early steps of cell division and also may play a role in regulating centrosome replication.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis is a highly controlled process that depends on diverse signalling pathways responding to cellular and environmental signals. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical metabolic enzyme that acts at a central control point in cellular energy homeostasis. Numerous studies have revealed the crucial roles of AMPK in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis; however, molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still largely unknown. Previously, we have shown that, in cellular slime mould <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the overexpression of the catalytic \u03b1 subunit of AMPK led to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, which was accompanied by reduced cell growth and aberrant development. Here, we applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics of <i>Dictyostelium</i> mitochondria to determine the impact of chronically active AMPK\u03b1 on the phosphorylation state and abundance of mitochondrial proteins and to identify potential protein targets leading to the biogenesis of mitochondria. Our results demonstrate that enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with variations in the phosphorylation levels and abundance of proteins related to energy metabolism, protein synthesis, transport, inner membrane biogenesis, and cellular signalling. The observed changes are accompanied by elevated mitochondrial respiratory activity in the AMPK overexpression strain. Our work is the first study reporting on the global phosphoproteome profiling of <i>D. discoideum</i> mitochondria and its changes as a response to constitutively active AMPK. We also propose an interplay between the AMPK and mTORC1 signalling pathways in controlling the cellular growth and biogenesis of mitochondria in <i>Dictyostelium</i> as a model organism.",

The comparison of Bi3 ToF-SIMS and C60 FTICR-SIMS suggested that while the first provides fast, high spatial resolution molecular ion images, the chemical complexity of biological samples warrants the use of high resolution analyzers for accurate ion identification.",

        "abstract": "For biophysical understanding of cell motility, the relationship between mechanical force and cell migration must be uncovered, but it remains elusive. Since cells migrate at small scale in dissipative circumstances, the inertia force is negligible and all forces should cancel out. This implies that one must quantify the spatial pattern of the force instead of just the summation to elucidate the force-motion relation. Here, we introduced multipole analysis to quantify the traction stress dynamics of migrating cells. We measured the traction stress of Dictyostelium discoideum cells and investigated the lowest two moments, the force dipole and quadrupole moments, which reflect rotational and front-rear asymmetries of the stress field. We derived a simple force-motion relation in which cells migrate along the force dipole axis with a direction determined by the force quadrupole. Furthermore, as a complementary approach, we also investigated fine structures in the stress field that show front-rear asymmetric kinetics consistent with the multipole analysis. The tight force-motion relation enables us to predict cell migration only from the traction stress patterns.",

We found that Dictyostelium deficient in the DNA repair nuclease Xpf (xpf<sup>-</sup>) display a severe and specific growth defect when feeding on bacteria. Despite being proficient in the phagocytosis and digestion of bacteria, over time, xpf<sup>-</sup> Dictyostelium feeding on bacteria cease to grow and in many instances die.

        "abstract": "The human-pathogenic fungus <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a ubiquitous saprophyte that causes fatal lung infections in immunocompromised individuals. Following inhalation, conidia are ingested by innate immune cells and can arrest phagolysosome maturation. How this virulence trait could have been selected for in natural environments is unknown. Here, we found that surface exposure of the green pigment 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-(DHN)-melanin can protect conidia from phagocytic uptake and intracellular killing by the fungivorous amoeba <i>Protostelium aurantium</i> and delays its exocytosis from the nonfungivorous species <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> To elucidate the antiphagocytic properties of the surface pigment, we followed the antagonistic interactions of <i>A. fumigatus</i> conidia with the amoebae in real time. For both amoebae, conidia covered with DHN-melanin were internalized at far lower rates than were seen with conidia lacking the pigment, despite high rates of initial attachment to nonkilling <i>D. discoideum</i> When ingested by <i>D. discoideum</i>, the formation of nascent phagosomes was followed by transient acidification of phagolysosomes, their subsequent neutralization, and, finally, exocytosis of the conidia. While the cycle was completed in less than 1 h for unpigmented conidia, the process was significantly prolonged for conidia covered with DHN-melanin, leading to an extended intracellular residence time. At later stages of this cellular infection, pigmented conidia induced enhanced damage to phagolysosomes and infected amoebae failed to recruit the ESCRT (<u>e</u>ndosomal <u>s</u>orting <u>c</u>omplex <u>r</u>equired for <u>t</u>ransport) membrane repair machinery or the canonical autophagy pathway to defend against the pathogen, thus promoting prolonged intracellular persistence in the host cell and the establishment of a germination niche in this environmental phagocyte.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infections with <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> are usually acquired by an inhalation of spores from environmental sources. How spores of a saprophytic fungus have acquired abilities to withstand and escape the phagocytic attacks of innate immune cells is not understood. The fungal surface pigment dihydroxynaphtalene-melanin has been shown to be a crucial factor for the delay in phagosome maturation. Here, we show that this pigment also has a protective function against environmental phagocytes. Pigmented conidia escaped uptake and killing by the fungus-eating amoeba <i>Protostelium aurantium</i> When ingested by the nonfungivorous phagocyte <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the pigment attenuated the launch of cell autonomous defenses against the fungal invader, such as membrane repair and autophagy, leading to prolonged intracellular retention. Membrane damage and cytoplasmic leakage may result in an influx of nutrients and thus may further promote intracellular germination of the fungus, indicating that <i>A. fumigatus</i> has acquired some of the basic properties of intracellular pathogens.",

At the aggregation stage of Dictyostelium discoideum development, the chemoattractant cAMP is synthesized and released at 6-min intervals, directing cell migration. Although the G protein-coupled cAMP receptor cAR1 and ERK2 are both implicated in regulating the oscillation, the signaling circuit remains unknown. Here we report that D. discoideum arrestins regulate the frequency of cAMP oscillation and may link cAR1 signaling to oscillatory ERK2 activity. Cells lacking arrestins (adcB(-)C(-)) display cAMP oscillations during the aggregation stage that are twice as frequent as for wild- type cells. The adcB(-)C(-) cells also have a shorter period of transient ERK2 activity and precociously reactivate ERK2 in response to cAMP stimulation. We show that arrestin domain-containing protein C (AdcC) associates with ERK2 and that activation of cAR1 promotes the transient membrane recruitment of AdcC and interaction with cAR1, indicating that arrestins function in cAR1-controlled periodic ERK2 activation and oscillatory cAMP signaling in the aggregation stage of D. discoideum development. In addition, ligand-induced cAR1 internalization is compromised in adcB(-)C(-) cells, suggesting that arrestins are involved in elimination of high-affinity cAR1 receptors from cell surface after the aggregation stage of multicellular development.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), also known as Batten disease, refers to a group of severe neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect children. The most common subtype of the disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in CLN3, which is conserved across model species from yeast to human. The precise function of the CLN3 protein is not known, which has made targeted therapy development challenging. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, loss of Cln3 causes aberrant mid-to-late stage multicellular development. In this study, we show that Cln3-deficiency causes aberrant adhesion and aggregation during the early stages of Dictyostelium development. cln3<sup>-</sup> cells form \u223c30% more multicellular aggregates that are comparatively smaller than those formed by wild-type cells. Loss of Cln3 delays aggregation, but has no significant effect on cell speed or cAMP-mediated chemotaxis. The aberrant aggregation of cln3<sup>-</sup> cells cannot be corrected by manually pulsing cells with cAMP. Moreover, there are no significant differences between wild-type and cln3<sup>-</sup> cells in the expression of genes linked to cAMP chemotaxis (e.g., adenylyl cyclase, acaA; the cAMP receptor, carA; cAMP phosphodiesterase, pdsA; g-protein \u03b1 9 subunit, gpaI). However, during this time in development, cln3<sup>-</sup> cells show reduced cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion, which correlate with changes in the levels of the cell adhesion proteins CadA and CsaA. Specifically, loss of Cln3 decreases the intracellular level of CsaA and increases the amount of soluble CadA in conditioned media. Together, these results suggest that the aberrant aggregation of cln3<sup>-</sup> cells is due to reduced adhesion during the early stages of development. Revealing the molecular basis underlying this phenotype may provide fresh new insight into CLN3 function.",

Because different clones may be involved in such aggregations, cheater strategies may emerge that allocate a smaller fraction of cells to stalk formation, thus gaining a reproductive advantage. In this paper, we model the evolutionary dynamics of allocation strategies in Dictyostelium under the realistic assumption that the number of clones involved in aggregations follows a random distribution. By determining the full course of evolutionary dynamics, we show that evolutionary branching in allocation strategies may occur, resulting in dimorphic populations that produce stalkless and stalked fruiting bodies.

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum has been used largely as a model organism to study the organization and function of the endocytic pathway. Here we describe dense structures present in D. discoideum endocytic compartments, which we named pycnosomes. Pycnosomes are constitutively secreted in the extracellular medium, from which they can be recovered by differential centrifugation. We identified the most abundant protein present in secreted pycnosomes, that we designated SctA. SctA defines a new family of proteins with four members in D. discoideum, and homologous proteins in other protists and eumetazoa. We developed a monoclonal antibody specific for SctA and used it to further characterize secreted and intracellular pycnosomes. Within cells, immunofluorescence as well as electron microscopy identified pycnosomes as SctA-enriched dense structures in the lumen of endocytic compartments. Pycnosomes are occasionally seen in continuity with intra-endosomal membranes, particularly in U18666A-treated cells where intraluminal budding is highly enhanced. While the exact nature, origin and cellular function of pycnosomes remain to be established, this study provides a first description of these structures as well as a characterization of reagents that can be used for further studies.",

        "abstract": "In Dictyostelium, sporulation occurs synchronously as prespore cells approach the apex of the aerial stalk during culmination. Each prespore cell becomes surrounded by its own coat comprised of a core of crystalline cellulose and a branched heteropolysaccharide sandwiched between heterogeneous cysteine-rich glycoproteins. The function of the heteropolysaccharide, which consists of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, is unknown. Two glycosyltransferase-like genes encoding multifunctional proteins, each with predicted features of a heteropolysaccharide synthase, were identified in the Dictyostelium discoideum genome. pgtB and pgtC transcripts were modestly upregulated during early development, and pgtB was further intensely upregulated at the time of heteropolysaccharide accumulation. Disruption of either gene reduced synthase-like activity and blocked heteropolysaccharide formation, based on loss of cytological labeling with a lectin and absence of component sugars after acid hydrolysis. Cell mixing experiments showed that heteropolysaccharide expression is spore cell autonomous, suggesting a physical association with other coat molecules during assembly. Mutant coats expressed reduced levels of crystalline cellulose based on chemical analysis after acid degradation, and cellulose was heterogeneously affected based on flow cytometry and electron microscopy. Mutant coats also contained elevated levels of selected coat proteins but not others and were sensitive to shear. Mutant spores were unusually susceptible to hypertonic collapse and damage by detergent or hypertonic stress. Thus, the heteropolysaccharide is essential for spore integrity, which can be explained by a role in the formation of crystalline cellulose and regulation of the protein content of the coat.",

This simplicity and manipulability has made Dictyostelium attractive to both experimental and theoretical developmental biologists. However, this outward simplicity conceals a surprising degree of developmental sophistication. Multiple prestalk subtypes are formed and undertake a co-ordinated series of morphogenetic cell movements to generate the fruiting body. This review describes recent advances in understanding the signalling pathways that generate prestalk-cell heterogeneity, focusing on the roles of the prestalk-cell inducer differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1), the tip inducer cAMP and the transcription factors that mediate their actions; these include signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins and a Myb protein of a class previously described only in plants.",

A similar analysis of the myosin II phosphorylation mutant 3XASP reveals a role for the cortical localization of myosin II in the suppression of lateral pseudopods, formation of the uropod, cytoplasmic distribution of cytoplasm in the main cell body, and efficient motility. The results of the morphometric analysis suggest that pseudopods, the main cell body, and the uropod represent three motility compartments that are coordinated for efficient translocation. It provides a contextual framework for interpreting the effects of mutations, inhibitors, and chemoattractants on the basic motile behavior of D. discoideum. The generality of the characteristics of the basic motile behavior of D. discoideum must now be tested by similar 4D analyses of the motility of amoeboid cells of higher eukaryotic cells, in particular human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.",

        "abstract": "Macrophages use diverse strategies to restrict intracellular pathogens, including either depriving the bacteria of (micro)nutrients such as transition metals or intoxicating them via metal accumulation. Little is known about the chemical warfare between <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, a close relative of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), and its hosts. We use the professional phagocyte <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> to investigate the role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> during <i>M. marinum</i> infection. We show that <i>M. marinum</i> senses toxic levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and responds by upregulating one of its isoforms of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> efflux transporter CtpC. Deletion of <i>ctpC</i> (MMAR_1271) leads to growth inhibition in broth supplemented with Zn<sup>2+</sup> as well as reduced intracellular growth. Both phenotypes were fully rescued by constitutive ectopic expression of the Mtb CtpC orthologue demonstrating that MMAR_1271 is the functional CtpC Zn<sup>2+</sup> efflux transporter in <i>M. marinum</i> Infection leads to the accumulation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> inside the <i>Mycobacterium</i>-containing vacuole (MCV), achieved by the induction and recruitment of the <i>D. discoideum</i> Zn<sup>2+</sup> efflux pumps ZntA and ZntB. In cells lacking ZntA, there is further attenuation of <i>M. marinum</i> growth, presumably due to a compensatory efflux of Zn<sup>2+</sup> into the MCV, carried out by ZntB, the main Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter in endosomes and phagosomes. Counterintuitively, bacterial growth is also impaired in <i>zntB</i> KO cells, in which MCVs appear to accumulate less Zn<sup>2+</sup> than in wild-type cells, suggesting restriction by other Zn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mechanisms. Absence of CtpC further epistatically attenuates the intracellular proliferation of <i>M. marinum</i> in <i>zntA</i> and <i>zntB</i> KO cells, confirming that mycobacteria face noxious levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup><b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microelements are essential for the function of the innate immune system. A deficiency in zinc or copper results in an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Zn<sup>2+</sup> serves as an important catalytic and structural cofactor for a variety of enzymes including transcription factors and enzymes involved in cell signaling. But Zn<sup>2+</sup> is toxic at high concentrations and represents a cell-autonomous immunity strategy that ensures killing of intracellular bacteria in a process called zinc poisoning. The cytosolic and lumenal Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations result from the balance of import into the cytosol via ZIP influx transporters and efflux via ZnT transporters. Here, we show that Zn<sup>2+</sup> poisoning is involved in restricting <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> infections. Our study extends observations during <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection and explores for the first time how the interplay of ZnT transporters affects mycobacterial infection by impacting Zn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.",

Here we report on the construction of a ~20 fold coverage D. discoideum genomic library in Escherichia coli, cloning 4-10 kilobase partial restriction fragments into a linear vector. End-sequencing indicates that most clones map to the six chromosomes in an unbiased distribution. Over 70% of these clones contain at least one complete open reading frame. We demonstrate that individual clones and library composition are stable over multiple replication cycles.

        "abstract": "The cDNA library prepared from Lentinula edodes, Hokken 600 (H600), primordia was screened using cDNA expressed specifically in Dictyostelium discoideum prestalk as a probe. Twenty-one clones, Le-Dd1\u2009~\u200921, were isolated from the L. edodes primordia cDNA library. Functional analysis of each gene was carried out by transformation into protoplast cells from L. edodes Mori 252 (M252) mycelia with the overexpression vector pLG-RasF1 of each gene because M252 protoplast cells were transformed with an 11-fold higher efficiency than H600 cells. Transformants with the overexpression vector of Le-Dd10 formed a fruiting body at almost the same time as H600, a positive control, although M252, a negative control, did not form a fruiting body under culture conditions. This suggested that Le-Dd10 is involved in the formation of fruiting bodies. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis revealed that Le-Dd10 is located on No. 4 linkage group of L. edodes. The properties of Le-Dd10 products were investigated by Western blotting analysis using polyclonal antibodies against GST:Le-Dd10 fusion proteins. As a result, 56-kDa, 27-kDa, and 14-kDa protein bands appeared in primordial and fruiting body stages, although the expected molecular weight of the Le-Dd10 product was 50\u00a0kDa.",

        "abstract": "Symbiont recognition is essential in many symbiotic relationships, especially for horizontally transferred symbionts. Therefore, how to find the right partner is a crucial challenge in these symbiotic relationships. Previous studies have demonstrated that both animals and plants have evolved various mechanisms to recognize their symbionts. However, studies about the mechanistic basis of establishing protist-bacterium symbioses are scarce. This study investigated this question using a social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and their <i>Burkholderia</i> symbionts. We found no evidence that D. discoideum hosts could distinguish different <i>Burkholderia</i> extracellularly in chemotaxis assays. Instead, symbiont-induced phagosome biogenesis contributed to the formation of social amoeba symbiosis, and D. discoideum hosts have a higher phagosome pH when carrying symbiotic <i>Burkholderia</i> than nonsymbiotic <i>Burkholderia</i>. In conclusion, the establishment of social amoeba symbiosis is not linked with extracellular discrimination but related to symbiont-induced phagosome biogenesis, which provides new insights into the mechanisms of endosymbiosis formation between protists and their symbionts. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Protists are single-celled, extremely diverse eukaryotic microbes. Like animals and plants, they live with bacterial symbionts and have complex relationships. In protist-bacterium symbiosis, while some symbionts are strictly vertically transmitted, others need to reestablish and acquire symbionts from the environment frequently. However, the mechanistic basis of establishing protist-bacterium symbioses is mostly unclear. This study uses a novel amoeba-symbiont system to show that the establishment of this symbiosis is not linked with extracellular discrimination. Instead, symbiont-induced phagosome biogenesis contributes to the formation of social amoeba-bacterium symbiosis. This study increases our understanding of the mechanistic basis of establishing protist-bacterium symbioses.",

Here, we describe the proteolytic processing and inner membrane potential-dependent translocation of a dynamin family member by the Dictyostelium discoideum mitochondrial import system. Our results show that the unusual D. discoideum dynamin B presequence is removed through a processing mechanism that is common for mitochondrial matrix proteins. We identified a minimal segment of the dynamin B presequence containing seven lysine residues. This 47-residue region is, in combination with consensus matrix protease cleavage sites, necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. The correct positioning of these lysine residues plays a critical role for the proper processing and mitochondrial import of dynamin B in D. discoideum. Fluorescent proteins tagged with the dynamin B presequence or presequence regions supporting mitochondrial import in D. discoideum are imported with similar efficiency into the mitochondrial matrix of mammalian cells, indicating that the basic mechanisms underlying mitochondrial protein import are highly conserved from amoebozoa to mammalia.",

The growth rate was optimal in 1X cells (cells grown in 1X glucose) but was impaired drastically in 2X cells, below the level of 0.5X cells. There were glucose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial dysfunction in parallel with the mRNA copy numbers of the enzymes catalyzing tetrahydropteridine synthesis and regeneration. On the other hand, both the specific activities of the enzymes and tetrahydropteridine levels in 2X cells were lower than those in 1X cells, but were higher than those in 0.5X cells. Given the antioxidant function of tetrahydropteridines and both the beneficial and harmful effects of ROS, the results suggest glucose-induced oxidative stress in Dictyostelium, a process that might originate from aerobic glycolysis, as well as a protective role of tetrahydropteridines against this stress.",

Recent experiments have quantified the spatio-temporal dynamics of these signaling components. Surprisingly, it was found that membrane-bound PTEN can be either in a high or low state, that PIP3 waves were initiated in areas lacking PTEN through an excitable mechanism, and that PIP3 was degraded even though the PTEN concentration remained low. Here we develop a reaction-diffusion model that aims to explain these experimental findings. Our model contains bistable dynamics for PTEN, excitable dynamics for PIP3, and postulates the existence of two species of PTEN with different dephosphorylation rates. We show that our model is able to produce results that are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments, suggesting that our reaction-diffusion model underlies the self-organized spatio-temporal patterns observed in experiments.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba are found in soil, feeding on bacteria. When food sources become scarce, they secrete factors to initiate a multicellular development program, during which single cells chemotax towards aggregation centers(1-4). This process is dependent on the release of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)(5). cAMP is produced in waves through the concerted action of adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterases, and binds to G protein-coupled cAMP receptors(6,7). A widely used assay to analyze the mechanisms involved in the developmental cycle of the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum is based on the observation of cell aggregation in submerged conditions(8,9). This protocol describes the analysis of the role of coronin A in the developmental cycle by starvation in tissue-culture plates submerged in balanced salt solution (BSS)(10). Coronin A is a member of the widely conserved protein family of coronins that have been implicated in a wide variety of activities(11,12). Dictyostelium cells lacking coronin A are unable to form multicellular aggregates, and this defect can be rescued by supplying pulses of cAMP, suggesting that coronin A acts upstream of the cAMP cascade(10). The techniques described in these studies provide robust tools to investigate functions of proteins during the initial stages of the developmental cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum upstream of the cAMP cascade. Therefore, utilizing this aggregation assay may allow the further study of coronin A function and advance our understanding of coronin biology.",

        "abstract": "In Dictyostelium discoideum, myosin II resides predominantly in a soluble pool as the result of phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain (MHC), and dephosphorylation of the MHC is required for myosin II filament assembly, recruitment to the cytoskeleton, and force production. Protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) was identified in earlier studies in Dictyostelium as a key biochemical activity that can drive MHC dephosphorylation. We report here gene targeting and cell biological studies addressing the roles of candidate PP2A B regulatory subunits (phr2aB\u03b1 and phr2aB\u03b2) in myosin II assembly control in vivo. Dictyostelium phr2aB\u03b1- and phr2aB\u03b2-null cells show delayed development, reduction in the assembly of myosin II in cytoskeletal ghost assays, and defects in cytokinesis when grown in suspension compared to parental cell lines. These results demonstrate that the PP2A B subunits phr2aB\u03b1 and phr2aB\u03b2 contribute to myosin II assembly control in vivo, with phr2aB\u03b1 having the predominant role facilitating MHC dephosphorylation to facilitate filament assembly.",

        "abstract": "Much remains to be understood about quorum-sensing factors that allow cells to sense their local density. Dictyostelium discoideum is a simple eukaryote that grows as single-celled amoebae and switches to multicellular development when food becomes limited. As the growing cells reach a high density, they begin expressing discoidin genes. The cells secrete an unknown factor, and at high cell densities the concomitant high levels of the factor induce discoidin expression. We report here the enrichment of discoidin-inducing complex (DIC), an approximately 400-kDa protein complex that induces discoidin expression during growth and development. Two proteins in the DIC preparation, DicA1 and DicB, were identified by sequencing proteolytic digests. DicA1 and DicB were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for their ability to induce discoidin during growth and development. Recombinant DicB was unable to induce discoidin expression, while recombinant DicA1 was able to induce discoidin expression. This suggests that DicA1 is an active component of DIC and indicates that posttranslational modification is dispensable for activity. DicA1 mRNA is expressed in vegetative and developing cells. The mature secreted form of DicA1 has a molecular mass of 80 kDa and has a 24-amino-acid cysteine-rich repeat that is similar to repeats in Dictyostelium proteins, such as the extracellular matrix protein ecmB/PstA, the prespore cell-inducing factor PSI, and the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor PDI. Together, the data suggest that DicA1 is a component of a secreted quorum-sensing signal regulating discoidin gene expression during Dictyostelium growth and development.",

Human leukocytes and D. disscoideum share remarkable similarities in the molecular mechanisms that control chemotaxis. These cells use G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), such as chemokine receptors, to control a signaling network that carries out chemotactic gradient sensing and directs cell migration. Diverse chemokines bind to their receptors to activate small G protein Rac through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Elmo and Dock180 proteins form ELMO/Dock180 complexes functioning as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rac activation. However, the linkage between GPCR to Elmo/Dock180 for Rac activation that controls F-actin dynamics remained unclear.

Putative alternative effectors contain sequences that interact with DAGs, but the mechanisms of signal transduction are unknown. We have identified a Dictyostelium gene encoding a novel protein which contains a domain with high identity to the DAG-binding domain of PKC. It does not encode a PKC homologue as the conservation does not extend outside this region. We confirm that the proposed DAG-binding domain is sufficient to mediate interaction of a fusion protein with vesicles containing DAG. The protein also shows significant homology to mammalian phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) kinases and we show that this domain has PIP kinase activity. The protein, PIPkinA, is enriched in the nucleus and abrogation of gene function by homologous recombination inhibits early developmental gene expression, blocking development at an early stage. Thus, we have identified a PIP kinase from Dictyostelium which is required for development, is a candidate effector for DAG and has the potential to synthesize nuclear PIP(2).",

We show that the Dictyostelium discoideum Dnmt2-homologue DnmA is an active tRNA methyltransferase that modifies C38 in tRNA(Asp(GUC)) in vitro and in vivo. By an ultraviolet-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation approach, we identified further DnmA targets. This revealed specific tRNA fragments bound by the enzyme and identified tRNA(Glu(CUC/UUC)) and tRNA(Gly(GCC)) as new but weaker substrates for both human Dnmt2 and DnmA in vitro but apparently not in vivo. Dnmt2 enzymes form transient covalent complexes with their substrates. The dynamics of complex formation and complex resolution reflect methylation efficiency in vitro. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed alterations in dnmA expression during development, cell cycle and in response to temperature stress. However, dnmA expression only partially correlated with tRNA methylation in vivo. Strikingly, dnmA expression in the laboratory strain AX2 was significantly lower than in the NC4 parent strain. As expression levels and binding of DnmA to a target in vivo are apparently not necessarily accompanied by methylation, we propose an additional biological function of DnmA apart from methylation.",

We propose that saturation mutagenesis under low mutagenic loads, followed by whole-genome sequencing, should allow direct implication of genes by identifying multiple independent alleles of each relevant gene. We tested the hypothesis by performing three genetic screens with chemical mutagenesis in the social soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum Through genome sequencing, we successfully identified mutant genes with multiple alleles in near-saturation screens, including resistance to intense illumination and strong suppressors of defects in an allorecognition pathway. We tested the causality of the mutations by comparison to published data and by direct complementation tests, finding both dominant and recessive causative mutations. Therefore, our strategy provides a cost- and time-efficient approach to gene discovery by integrating chemical mutagenesis and whole-genome sequencing. The method should be applicable to many microbial systems, and it is expected to revolutionize the field of functional genomics in Dictyostelium by greatly expanding the mutation spectrum relative to other common mutagenesis methods.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about how individual cells can organize themselves to form structures of a given size. During development, Dictyostelium discoideum aggregates in dendritic streams and forms groups of approximately 20,000 cells. D. discoideum regulates group size by secreting and simultaneously sensing a multiprotein complex called counting factor (CF). If there are too many cells in a stream, the associated high concentration of CF will decrease cell-cell adhesion and increase cell motility, causing aggregation streams to break up. The pulses of cyclic AMP (cAMP) that mediate aggregation cause a transient translocation of Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) to the leading edge of the plasma membrane and a concomitant activation of the kinase activity, which in turn stimulates motility. We found that countin- cells (which lack bioactive CF) and wild-type cells starved in the presence of anticountin antibodies (which block CF activity) showed a decreased level of cAMP-stimulated Akt/PKB membrane translocation and kinase activity compared to parental wild-type cells. Recombinant countin has the bioactivity of CF, and a 1-min treatment of cells with recombinant countin potentiated Akt/PKB translocation to membranes and Akt/PKB activity. Western blotting of total cell lysates indicated that countin does not affect the total level of Akt/PKB. Fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing an Akt/PKB pleckstrin homology domain-green fluorescent protein (PH-GFP) fusion protein indicated that recombinant countin and anti-countin antibodies do not obviously alter the distribution of Akt/PKB PH-GFP when it translocates to the membrane. Our data indicate that CF increases motility by potentiating the cAMP-stimulated activation and translocation of Akt/PKB.",

Previous studies failed to detect 5-methylcytosine in Dictyostelium genomic DNA, but the recent sequencing of the Dictyostelium genome revealed a candidate DNA methyltransferase gene (dnmA). The genome sequence also uncovered an unusual distribution of potential methylation sites, CpG islands, throughout the genome. DnmA belongs to the Dnmt2 subfamily and contains all the catalytic motifs necessary for cytosine methyltransferases. Dnmt2 activity is typically weak in Drosophila melanogaster, mouse, and human cells and the gene function in these systems is unknown. We have investigated the methylation status of Dictyostelium genomic DNA with antibodies raised against 5-methylcytosine and detected low levels of the modified nucleotide. We also found that DNA methylation increased during development. We searched the genome for potential methylation sites and found them in retrotransposable elements and in several other genes. Using Southern blot analysis with methylation-sensitive and -insensitive restriction endonucleases, we found that the DIRS retrotransposon and the guaB gene were indeed methylated. We then mutated the dnmA gene and found that DNA methylation was reduced to about 50% of the wild-type level. The mutant cells exhibited morphological defects in late development, indicating that DNA methylation has a regulatory role in Dictyostelium development. Our findings establish a role for a Dnmt2 methyltransferase in eukaryotic development.",

Spore coat assembly is initiated by exocytosis of protein and polysaccharide precursors at the cell surface, followed by the infusion of nascent cellulose fibrils, resulting in an asymmetrical trilaminar sandwich with cellulose filling the middle layer. A molecular complex consisting of cellulose and two proteins, SP85 and SP65, is associated with the inner and middle layers and is required for proper organization of distinct proteins in the outer layer. Here we show that, unlike SP85 and other protein precursors, which are stored in prespore vesicles, SP65 is, like cellulose, synthesized just in time. By tagging the SP65 locus with green fluorescent protein, we find that SP65 is delivered to the cell surface via largely distinct vesicles, suggesting that separate delivery of components of the cellulose-SP85-SP65 complex regulates its formation at the cell surface. In support of previous in vivo studies, recombinant SP65 and SP85 are shown to interact directly. In addition, truncation of SP65 causes a defect of the outer layer permeability barrier as seen previously for SP85 mutants. These observations suggest that assembly of the cellulose-SP85-SP65 triad at the cell surface is biosynthetically regulated both temporally and spatially and that the complex contributes an essential function to outer layer architecture and function.",

Three predation-resistant strains frequently caused extracellular infections of fruiting bodies but were not found within spores. Furthermore, infection by one of these species induces secondary infections and suppresses predation of otherwise edible bacteria. Another strain can persist inside of amoebae after being phagocytosed but is rarely taken up. We sequenced isolate genomes and discovered that predation-resistant isolates are not monophyletic. Many Pseudomonas isolates encode secretion systems and toxins known to improve resistance to phagocytosis in other species, as well as diverse secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters that may contribute to predation resistance. However, the distribution of these genes alone cannot explain why some strains are edible and others are not. Each lineage may employ a unique mechanism for resistance.",

        "abstract": "Inositol levels, maintained by the biosynthetic enzyme inositol-3-phosphate synthase (Ino1), are altered in a range of disorders, including bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease. To date, most inositol studies have focused on the molecular and cellular effects of inositol depletion without considering Ino1 levels. Here we employ a simple eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum, to demonstrate distinct effects of loss of Ino1 and inositol depletion. We show that loss of Ino1 results in an inositol auxotrophy that can be rescued only partially by exogenous inositol. Removal of inositol supplementation from the ino1(-) mutant resulted in a rapid 56% reduction in inositol levels, triggering the induction of autophagy, reduced cytokinesis, and substrate adhesion. Inositol depletion also caused a dramatic generalized decrease in phosphoinositide levels that was rescued by inositol supplementation. However, loss of Ino1 triggered broad metabolic changes consistent with the induction of a catabolic state that was not rescued by inositol supplementation. These data suggest a metabolic role for Ino1 that is independent of inositol biosynthesis. To characterize this role, an Ino1 binding partner containing SEL1L1 domains (Q54IX5) and having homology to mammalian macromolecular complex adaptor proteins was identified. Our findings therefore identify a new role for Ino1, independent of inositol biosynthesis, with broad effects on cell metabolism.",

In contrast to the large body of studies that addressed how movement of cells is determined by spatial and temporal cues encoded in the dynamic cAMP gradients, how cell mechanics affect the formation of a self-generated chemoattractant field has received less attention. Here, we show, by live cell imaging analysis, that the periodicity of the synchronized cAMP waves increases in cells treated with the actin inhibitor latrunculin. Detail analysis of the extracellular cAMP-induced transients of cytosolic cAMP (cAMP relay response) in well-isolated cells demonstrated that their amplitude and duration were markedly reduced in latrunculin-treated cells. Similarly, in cells strongly adhered to a poly-l-lysine-coated surface, the response was suppressed, and the periodicity of the population-level oscillations was markedly lengthened. Our results suggest that cortical F-actin is dispensable for the basic low amplitude relay response but essential for its full amplification and that this enhanced response is necessary to establish high-frequency signalling centres. The observed F-actin dependence may prevent aggregation centres from establishing in microenvironments that are incompatible with cell migration.",

        "abstract": "Spatiotemporal patterns often emerge from local interactions in a self-organizing fashion. In biology, the resulting patterns are also subject to the influence of the systematic differences between the system's constituents (biological variability). This regulation of spatiotemporal patterns by biological variability is the topic of our review. We discuss several examples of correlations between cell properties and the self-organized spatiotemporal patterns, together with their relevance for biology. Our guiding, illustrative example will be spiral waves of cAMP in a colony of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Analogous processes take place in diverse situations (such as cardiac tissue, where spiral waves occur in potentially fatal ventricular fibrillation) so a deeper understanding of this additional layer of self-organized pattern formation would be beneficial to a wide range of applications. One of the most striking differences between pattern-forming systems in physics or chemistry and those in biology is the potential importance of variability. In the former, system components are essentially identical with random fluctuations determining the details of the self-organization process and the resulting patterns. In biology, due to variability, the properties of potentially very few cells can have a driving influence on the resulting asymptotic collective state of the colony. Variability is one means of implementing a few-element control on the collective mode. Regulatory architectures, parameters of signaling cascades, and properties of structure formation processes can be \"reverse-engineered\" from observed spatiotemporal patterns, as different types of regulation and forms of interactions between the constituents can lead to markedly different correlations. The power of this biology-inspired view of pattern formation lies in building a bridge between two scales: the patterns as a collective state of a very large number of cells on the one hand, and the internal parameters of the single cells on the other.",

The synthesis of poly P, a polymer of tens or hundreds of phosphate residues linked by high energy, ATP-like bonds, is catalyzed in most bacteria by poly P kinase (PPK1). The eukaryote D. discoideum possesses a homolog of PPK1. We report here that mutants of D. discoideum PPK1 (DdPPK1) have reduced levels of poly P and are deficient in development. Fruiting bodies are smaller and produce fewer spores, which appear to germinate like the wild type (WT). The DdPPK1 mutant formed smaller plaques on bacterial lawns compared with those of the WT. Predation by D. discoideum, assessed by uptake and digestion of Klebsiella aerogenes, showed that fewer bacteria were taken up by the DdPPK1 mutant compared with the WT and were killed less rapidly, indicating a role of poly P and/or DdPPK1 in phagocytosis. On Pseudomonas aeruginosa lawns, cleared plaques were observed with the bacterial PPK1 mutant but not with the WT P. aeruginosa. Thus, poly P is important in predation both for the predator and prey.",

Epistasis analysis in the soil amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> suggests the atypical MAPK Erk2 downregulates the function of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase RegA to regulate progression of the developmental life cycle. A putative MAPK docking motif located near a predicted MAPK phosphorylation site was characterized for contributions to RegA function and binding to Erk2 because a similar docking motif has been previously characterized in the mammalian PDE4D phosphodiesterase. The overexpression of RegA with alterations to this docking motif (RegA<sup>D-</sup>) restored RegA function to <i>regA-</i> cells based on developmental phenotypes, but low-level expression of RegA<sup>D-</sup> from the endogenous <i>regA</i> promoter failed to rescue wild-type morphogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Erk2 associates with both RegA and RegA<sup>D-</sup>, suggesting the docking motif is not required for this association. Epistasis analysis between <i>regA</i> and the only other <i>Dictyostelium</i> MAPK, <i>erk1</i>, suggests Erk1 and RegA can function in different pathways but that some <i>erk1-</i> phenotypes may require cAMP signalling. These results imply that MAPK downregulation of RegA in <i>Dictyostelium</i> is accomplished through a different mechanism than MAPK regulation of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases in mammalian cells and that the regulation in <i>Dictyostelium</i> does not require a proximal MAPK docking motif.",

Recent studies have uncovered the molecules that mediate this process in a variety of organisms, making it intriguing to consider conservation and evolution of the mechanisms of sexual reproduction across phyla. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum undergoes sexual maturation and forms gametes under dark and humid conditions. It exhibits three mating types, type-I, -II, and -III, for the heterothallic mating system. Based on proteome analyses of the gamete membranes, we detected expression of two homologs of the plant fertilization protein HAP2-GCS1. When their coding genes were disrupted in type-I and type-II strains, sexual potency was completely lost, whereas disruption in the type-III strain did not affect mating behavior, suggesting that the latter acts as female in complex organisms. Our results demonstrate the highly conserved function of HAP2-GCS1 in gamete interactions and suggest the presence of additional allo-recognition mechanisms in D. discoideum gametes.",

We show here that dedifferentiation in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum relies on a sequence of events that is independent of the original developmental state and involves the coordinated expression of a specific set of genes. A defect in one of these genes, the histidine kinase dhkA, alters the kinetics of dedifferentiation and uncouples the progression of dedifferentiation events.

Here we extend these findings, showing that LPS treatment leads to induction of autophagosomal maturation in cells responding to the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Cells treated with the autophagy-inducing drug rapamycin clear internalized bacteria at an accelerated rate, while LPS-enhanced clearance of bacteria is reduced in cells deficient for the autophagy-related genes atg1 and atg9.

Steely proteins possess six catalytic domains homologous to metazoan type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) but feature an iterative type III polyketide synthase (PKS) in place of the expected FAS C-terminal thioesterase used to off load fatty acid products. This new domain arrangement likely facilitates covalent transfer of steely N-terminal acyl products directly to the C-terminal type III PKS active sites, which catalyze both iterative polyketide extension and cyclization. The crystal structure of a steely C-terminal domain confirms conservation of the homodimeric type III PKS fold.

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium cells are forest soil amoebae, which feed on bacteria and proliferate as solitary cells until bacteria are consumed. Starvation triggers a change in life style, forcing cells to gather into aggregates to form multicellular organisms capable of cell differentiation and morphogenesis. As a soil amoeba and a phagocyte that grazes on bacteria as the obligate source of food, Dictyostelium could be a natural host of pathogenic bacteria. Indeed, many pathogens that occasionally infect humans are hosted for most of their time in protozoa or free-living amoebae, where evolution of their virulence traits occurs. Due to these features and its amenability to genetic manipulation, Dictyostelium has become a valuable model organism for studying strategies of both the host to resist infection and the pathogen to escape the defense mechanisms. Similarly to higher eukaryotes, iron homeostasis is crucial for Dictyostelium resistance to invasive bacteria. Iron is essential for Dictyostelium, as both iron deficiency or overload inhibit cell growth. The Dictyostelium genome shares with mammals many genes regulating iron homeostasis. Iron transporters of the Nramp (Slc11A) family are represented with two genes, encoding Nramp1 and Nramp2. Like the mammalian ortholog, Nramp1 is recruited to phagosomes and macropinosomes, whereas Nramp2 is a membrane protein of the contractile vacuole network, which regulates osmolarity. Nramp1 and Nramp2 localization in distinct compartments suggests that both proteins synergistically regulate iron homeostasis. Rather than by absorption via membrane transporters, iron is likely gained by degradation of ingested bacteria and efflux via Nramp1 from phagosomes to the cytosol. Nramp gene disruption increases Dictyostelium sensitivity to infection, enhancing intracellular growth of Legionella or Mycobacteria. Generation of mutants in other \"iron genes\" will help identify genes essential for iron homeostasis and resistance to pathogens.",

Farming status previously has been attributed to amoeba genotype, but the role of bacterial partners in its induction has not been examined. Here, we explore the role of bacterial associates in the initiation, maintenance, and phenotypic effects of the farming symbiosis. We demonstrate that two clades of farmer-associated Burkholderia isolates colonize D. discoideum nonfarmers and infectiously endow them with farmer-like characteristics, indicating that Burkholderia symbionts are a major driver of the farming phenomenon. Under food-rich conditions, Burkholderia-colonized amoebas produce fewer spores than uncolonized counterparts, with the severity of this reduction being dependent on the Burkholderia colonizer. However, the induction of food carriage by Burkholderia colonization may be considered a conditionally adaptive trait because it can confer an advantage to the amoeba host when grown in food-limiting conditions. We observed Burkholderia inside and outside colonized D. discoideum spores after fruiting body formation; this observation, together with the ability of Burkholderia to colonize new amoebas, suggests a mixed mode of symbiont transmission. These results change our understanding of the D. discoideum farming symbiosis by establishing that the bacterial partner, Burkholderia, is an important causative agent of the farming phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic of metazoans is the formation of a simple, polarized epithelium. In higher animals, the structural integrity and functional polarization of simple epithelia require a cell-cell adhesion complex that contains a classical cadherin, the Wnt-signaling protein \u03b2-catenin and the actin-binding protein \u03b1-catenin. We show that the non-metazoan Dictyostelium discoideum forms a polarized epithelium that is essential for multicellular development. Although D. discoideum lacks a cadherin homolog, we identify an \u03b1-catenin ortholog that binds a \u03b2-catenin-related protein. Both proteins are essential for formation of the epithelium, polarized protein secretion, and proper multicellular morphogenesis. Thus, the organizational principles of metazoan multicellularity may be more ancient than previously recognized, and the role of the catenins in cell polarity predates the evolution of Wnt signaling and classical cadherins.",

        "abstract": "Genes with sequence similarity to the yeast tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase (Thg1) gene have been identified in all three domains of life, and Thg1 family enzymes are implicated in diverse processes, ranging from tRNA(His) maturation to 5'-end repair of tRNAs. All of these activities take advantage of the ability of Thg1 family enzymes to catalyze 3'-5' nucleotide addition reactions. Although many Thg1-containing organisms have a single Thg1-related gene, certain eukaryotic microbes possess multiple genes with sequence similarity to Thg1. Here we investigate the activities of four Thg1-like proteins (TLPs) encoded by the genome of the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum (a member of the eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa). We show that one of the four TLPs is a bona fide Thg1 ortholog, a cytoplasmic G(-1) addition enzyme likely to be responsible for tRNA(His) maturation in D. discoideum. Two other D. discoideum TLPs exhibit biochemical activities consistent with a role for these enzymes in mitochondrial 5'-tRNA editing, based on their ability to efficiently repair the 5' ends of mitochondrial tRNA editing substrates. Although 5'-tRNA editing was discovered nearly two decades ago, the identity of the protein(s) that catalyze this activity has remained elusive. This article provides the first identification of any purified protein that appears to play a role in the 5'-tRNA editing reaction. Moreover, the presence of multiple Thg1 family members in D. discoideum suggests that gene duplication and divergence during evolution has resulted in paralogous proteins that use 3'-5' nucleotide addition reactions for diverse biological functions in the same organism.",

The FtsZ proteins are known to mediate membrane remodeling events such as cytokinesis in bacteria and fission of chloroplasts; <i>D. discoideum</i> has two FtsZ proteins, FszA and FszB. To determine the role of these proteins in mitochondrial dynamics we overexpressed FszB-GFP and determined its effect on fission, fusion, and motility in the presence of intact and disrupted cytoskeletal filaments.

How cells can switch between these modes is not well understood but waves of signaling events are thought to play an important role in these transitions. Here we present a simple two-component biochemical reaction-diffusion model based on relaxation oscillators and couple this to a model for the mechanics of cell deformations. Different migration modes, including amoeboid-like and keratocyte-like, naturally emerge through transitions determined by interactions between biochemical traveling waves, cell mechanics and morphology. The model predictions are explicitly verified by systematically reducing the protrusive force of the actin network in experiments using <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells.

        "abstract": "The evolution of novel cell types has been proposed to result from duplication of gene regulatory networks, but proven examples are rare. In addition to stalk cells and spores that make up the fruiting bodies of three major groups of Dictyostelia, those in group 4 additionally evolved basal disc and cup cells that respectively anchor the stalk to the substratum and the spore mass to the stalk. We noted a putative group-4-specific duplication of a cudA-like transcription factor (TF) in a comparative analysis of group-representative genomes. Using increased taxon sampling, we here confirmed that this TF, cdl1, duplicated into cdl1a and cdl1b in the common ancestor to group 4. cdl1a, but not cdl1b, showed signatures of positive selection, indicative of functional innovation. Deletion of cdl1a in Dictyostelium discoideum resulted in fruiting bodies with sagging spore heads that lacked the supporting cup cells and expression of cup-specific genes. Deletion of cdl1b resulted in thinner fruiting body stalks, while a cdl1b<sup>-</sup>cdl1a<sup>-</sup> double knockout showed more severe stalk defects, suggesting an ancestral role of cdl1 in stalk formation. This was confirmed in a closely related non-group 4 species, Polysphondylium violaceum, where cdl1 knockout caused defective stalk formation. These data indicate that the group-specific duplication of cdl1 and subsequent diversification of cdl1a played a pivotal role in the evolution of a novel somatic cell type in group 4 Dictyostelia.",

        "abstract": "Paxillin is a key player in integrating the actin cytoskeleton with adhesion, and thus is essential to numerous cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration in animal cells. PaxB, the Dictyostelium discoideum orthologue of paxillin, has been shown to be important for adhesion and development, much like its mammalian counterpart. Here, we use the overproduction of PaxB to gain better insight into its role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion. We find that PaxB-overexpressing (PaxBOE) cells can aggregate and form mounds normally, but are blocked in subsequent development. This arrest can be rescued by addition of wild-type cells, indicating a non-cell autonomous role for PaxB. PaxBOE cells also have alterations in several actin-based processes, including adhesion, endocytosis, motility, and chemotaxis. PaxBOE cells exhibit an EDTA-sensitive increase in cell-cell cohesion, suggesting that PaxB-mediated adhesion is Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) dependent. Interestingly, cells overexpressing paxB are less adhesive to the substratum. In addition, PaxBOE cells display decreased motility under starved conditions, decreased endocytosis, and are unable to efficiently chemotax up a folate gradient. Taken together, the data suggest that proper expression of PaxB is vital for the regulation of development and actin-dependent processes.",

Expression of the protein encoded in pBSGT-3 in Escherichia coli, its thiolase enzyme activity, and the amino acid sequence homology search revealed that pBSGT-3 encodes an AT. The recombinant AT (r-thiolase) was expressed in an active form in an E. coli expression system, and purified to homogeneity by selective ammonium sulfate fractionation and two steps of column chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 4.70 mU/mg protein. Its N-terminal sequence was (NH\u2082)-Arg-Met-Tyr-Thr-Thr-Ala-Lys-Asn-Leu-Glu-, which corresponds to the sequence from positions 15 to 24 of the amino acid sequence deduced from pBSGT-3 clone. The r-thiolase in the inclusion body expressed highly in E. coli was the precursor form, which is slightly larger than the purified r-thiolase. When incubated with the cell-free extract of Dictyostelium cells, the precursor was converted to the same size to the purified r-thiolase, suggesting that the presequence at the N-terminus is removed by a Dictyostelium processing peptidase.",

Recently, we showed that D. discoideum is remarkably resilient to protein aggregation and can be used to gain insights into the cellular protein quality control system. However, the use of D. discoideum as a model system poses several challenges to microscopy-based experimental approaches, such as the high motility of the cells and their susceptibility to photo-toxicity. The latter proves to be especially challenging when studying protein homeostasis, as the phototoxic effects can induce a cellular stress response and thus alter to behavior of the protein quality control system. Temperature increase is a commonly used way to induce cellular stress. Here, we describe a temperature-controllable imaging protocol, which allows observing temperature-induced perturbations in D. discoideum. Moreover, when applied at normal growth temperature, this imaging protocol can also noticeably reduce photo-toxicity, thus allowing imaging with higher intensities. This can be particularly useful when imaging proteins with very low expression levels. Moreover, the high mobility of the cells often requires the acquisition of multiple fields of view to follow individual cells, and the number of fields needs to be balanced against the desired time interval and exposure time.",

The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has two talin homologues, talA and talB, and earlier studies have characterized the single knockout mutants. talA(-) cells show reduced adhesion to the substrates and slightly impaired cytokinesis leading to a high proportion of multinucleated cells in the vegetative stage, while the development is normal. In contrast, talB(-) cells are characterized by reduced motility in the developmental stage, and they are arrested at the tight-mound stage. Here, we created and analyzed a double mutant with a disruption of both talA and talB. Defects in adhesion to the substrates, cytokinesis, and development were more severe in cells with a disruption of both talA and talB. The talA(-) talB(-) cells failed to attach to the substrates in the vegetative stage, exhibited a higher proportion of multinucleated cells than talA(-) cells, and showed more-reduced motility during the development and an earlier developmental arrest than talB(-) cells at the loose-mound stage. Moreover, overexpression of either talA or talB compensated for the loss of the other talin, respectively. The analysis of talA(-) talB(-) cells also revealed that talin was required for the formation of paxillin-rich adhesion sites and that there was another adhesion mechanism which is independent of talin in the developmental stage. This is the first study demonstrating overlapping functions of two talin homologues, and our data further indicate the importance of talin.",

Although the basic components have a shared origin, silencing pathways directed by small RNAs have evolved in diverse directions in different eukaryotic lineages.

Here, we report, for the first time, deep sequencing of small RNAs from the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. RNA from growing single-cell amoebae as well as from two multicellular developmental stages was sequenced. Computational analyses combined with experimental data reveal the expression of miRNAs, several of them exhibiting distinct expression patterns during development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of miRNAs in the Amoebozoa supergroup. We also show that overexpressed miRNA precursors generate miRNAs and, in most cases, miRNA* sequences, whose biogenesis is dependent on the Dicer-like protein DrnB, further supporting the presence of miRNAs in D. discoideum. In addition, we find miRNAs processed from hairpin structures originating from an intron as well as from a class of repetitive elements. We believe that these repetitive elements are sources for newly evolved miRNAs.",

A second-site suppressor of this ampA-overexpressing phenotype identified a previously uncharacterized gene, ndm, which is described here. The Ndm protein is predicted to contain a coiled-coil BAR-like domain-a domain involved in endocytosis and membrane bending. ndm-knockout and Ndm-monomeric red fluorescent protein-expressing cell lines were used to establish a role for ndm in suppressing endocytosis. An increase in the rate of endocytosis and in the number of endosomes was detected in ndm(-) cells. During migration ndm(-) cells formed numerous endocytic cups instead of the broad lamellipodia structure characteristic of moving cells. A second lamellipodia-based function-cell spreading-was also defective in the ndm(-) cells. The increase in endocytosis and the defect in lamellipodia formation were associated with reduced chemotaxis in ndm(-) cells. Immunofluorescence results and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed an association of Ndm with coronin and F-actin. The results establish ndm as a gene important in regulating the balance between formation of endocytic cups and lamellipodia structures.",

        "abstract": "The complex transition from a single-cell to a multicellular life form during the formation of a fruiting body by the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is accompanied by a pulsatile collective signaling process that instigates chemotaxis of the constituent cells. Although the cells used for the analysis of this phenomenon are normally genetically identical (isogenic), it is not clear whether they are equally responsive to the waves of the signaling stimulus, nor is it clear how responses across the population influence collective cell behavior. Here, we found that isogenic Dictyostelium cells displayed differing sensitivities to the chemoattractant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, the resulting signaling responses could be explained by a model in which cells are refractory to further stimulation for 5 to 6 min after the initial input and the signaling output is amplified, with the amplification threshold varying across the cells in the population. This pathway structure could explain intracellular amplification of the chemoattractant gradient during cell migration. The new model predicts that diverse cell responsiveness can facilitate collective cell behavior, specifically due to the presence of a small number of cells in the population with increased responsiveness that aid in propagating the initial cAMP signaling wave across the cell population.",

However, despite our sophisticated understanding of how conflict shapes social traits, we have limited knowledge of how it impacts molecular evolution across the underlying social genes. Here we address this problem by analyzing the genome-wide impact of social interactions using genome sequences from 67 Dictyostelium discoideum strains. We find that social genes tend to exhibit enhanced polymorphism and accelerated evolution. However, these patterns are not consistent with conflict driven processes, but instead reflect relaxed purifying selection. This pattern is most likely explained by the conditional nature of social interactions, whereby selection on genes expressed only in social interactions is diluted by generations of inactivity. This dilution of selection by inactivity enhances the role of drift, leading to increased polymorphism and accelerated evolution, which we call the Red King process.",

The vast majority of eukaryotes encodes only a class I RNR, but interestingly some eukaryotes, including the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, encode both a class I and a class II RNR. The amino acid sequence of the D. discoideum class I RNR is similar to other eukaryotic RNRs, whereas that of its class II RNR is most similar to the monomeric class II RNRs found in Lactobacillus spp. and a few other bacteria. Here we report the first study of RNRs in a eukaryotic organism that encodes class I and class II RNRs. Both classes of RNR genes were expressed in D. discoideum cells, although the class I transcripts were more abundant and strongly enriched during mid-development compared with the class II transcript. The quaternary structure, allosteric regulation, and properties of the diiron-oxo/radical cofactor of D. discoideum class I RNR are similar to those of the mammalian RNRs. Inhibition of D. discoideum class I RNR by hydroxyurea resulted in a 90% reduction in spore formation and decreased the germination viability of the surviving spores by 75%. Class II RNR could not compensate for class I inhibition during development, and an excess of vitamin B12 coenzyme, which is essential for class II activity, did not improve spore formation. We suggest that class I is the principal RNR during D. discoideum development and growth and is important for spore formation, possibly by providing dNTPs for mitochondrial replication.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae with an altered fbxA gene, which is thought to encode a component of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase, have defective regulation of cell type proportionality. In chimeras with wild-type cells, the mutant amoebae form mainly spores, leaving the construction of stalks to wild-type cells. To examine the role of fbxA and regulated proteolysis, we have recovered the promoter of fbxA and shown that it is expressed in a pattern resembling that of a prestalk-specific gene until late in development, when it is also expressed in developing spore cells. Because fbxA cells are developmentally deficient in pure culture, we were able to select suppressor mutations that promote sporulation of the original mutant. One suppressor mutation resides within the gene regA, which encodes a cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase linked to an activating response regulator domain. In another suppressor, there has been a disruption of dhkA, a gene encoding a two-component histidine kinase known to influence Dictyostelium development. RegA appears precociously and in greater amounts in the fbxA mutant than in the wild type, but in an fbxA/dhkA double mutant, RegA is restored to wild-type levels. Because the basis of regA suppression might involve alterations in cAMP levels during development, the concentrations of cAMP in all strains were determined. The levels of cAMP are relatively constant during multicellular development in all strains except the dhkA mutant, in which it is reduced at least sixfold. The level of cAMP in the double mutant dhkA/fbxA is relatively normal. The levels of cAMP in the various mutants do not correlate with spore formation, as would be expected on the basis of our present understanding of the signaling pathway leading to the induction of spores. Altered amounts of RegA and cAMP early in the development of the mutants suggest that both fbxA and dhkA genes act earlier than previously thought.",

In parallel to these studies, we wish to introduce these unique biotechnologies for use in the basic biological sciences, for handling a wide range of cell types and systems, thus increasing the range and the scope of these techniques for modern research. Here, the authors present the analysis of the new use of these biospray techniques for the direct handling of the simple eukaryotic biomedical model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. These cells are widely used as a model for immune cell chemotaxis and as a simple model for development. We demonstrate that AABJ of these cells did not cause cell stress, as defined by the stress-gene induction, nor affect cell development. Furthermore, although BES induced the increased expression of one stress-related gene (gapA), this was not a generalized stress response nor did it affect cell development. These data suggest that these biospray techniques can be used to directly manipulate single cells of this biomedical model without inducing a generalized stress response or perturbing later development.",

        "abstract": "On starvation, the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum initiates a program of development leading to formation of multicellular structures. The initial cell aggregation requires chemotaxis to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and relay of the cAMP signal by the activation of adenylyl cyclase (ACA), and it has been shown previously that the Ras protein RasC is involved in both processes. Insertional inactivation of the rasG gene resulted in delayed aggregation and a partial inhibition of early gene expression, suggesting that RasG also has a role in early development. Both chemotaxis and ACA activation were reduced in the rasG- cells, but the effect on chemotaxis was more pronounced. When the responses of rasG- cells to cAMP were compared with the responses of rasC- and rasC- rasG- strains, generated in otherwise isogenic backgrounds, these studies revealed that signal transduction through RasG is more important in chemotaxis and early gene expression, but that signal transduction through RasC is more important in ACA activation. Because the loss of either of the two Ras proteins alone did not result in a total loss of signal output down either of the branches of the cAMP signal-response pathway, there appears to be some overlap of function.",

        "abstract": "We performed a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum to estimate the rate and distribution of effects of spontaneous mutations affecting eight putative fitness traits. We found that the per-generation mutation rate for most fitness components is 0.0019 mutations per haploid genome per generation or larger. This rate is an order of magnitude higher than estimates for fitness components in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, even though the base-pair substitution rate is two orders of magnitude lower. The high rate of fitness-altering mutations observed in this species may be partially explained by a large mutational target relative to S. cerevisiae. Fitness-altering mutations also may occur primarily at simple sequence repeats, which are common throughout the genome, including in coding regions, and may represent a target that is particularly likely to give fitness effects upon mutation. The majority of mutations had deleterious effects on fitness, but there was evidence for a substantial fraction, up to 40%, being beneficial for some of the putative fitness traits. Competitive ability within the multicellular slug appears to be under weak directional selection, perhaps reflecting the fact that slugs are sometimes, but not often, comprised of multiple clones in nature. Evidence for pleiotropy among fitness components across MA lines was absent, suggesting that mutations tend to act on single fitness components.",

        "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of the polyglutamine diseases. One potential treatment for these diseases is suppression of polyglutamine aggregation. Previous work identified the cellular slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> as being naturally resistant to polyglutamine aggregation. Further work identified serine-rich chaperone protein 1 (SRCP1) as a protein that is both necessary in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and sufficient in human cells to suppress polyglutamine aggregation. Therefore, understanding how SRCP1 suppresses aggregation may be useful for developing therapeutics for the polyglutamine diseases. Here we utilized a <i>de novo</i> protein modeling approach to generate predictions of SRCP1's structure. Using our best-fit model, we generated mutants that were predicted to alter the stability of SRCP1 and tested these mutants' stability in cells. Using these data, we identified top models of SRCP1's structure that are consistent with the C-terminal region of SRCP1 forming a \u03b2-hairpin with a highly dynamic N-terminal region. We next generated a series of peptides that mimic the predicted \u03b2-hairpin and validated that they inhibit aggregation of a polyglutamine-expanded mutant huntingtin exon 1 fragment <i>in vitro</i>. To further assess mechanistic details of how SRCP1 inhibits polyglutamine aggregation, we utilized biochemical assays to determine that SRCP1 inhibits secondary nucleation in a manner dependent upon the regions flanking the polyglutamine tract. Finally, to determine if SRCP1 more could generally suppress protein aggregation, we confirmed that it was sufficient to inhibit aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3. Together these studies provide details into the structural and mechanistic basis of the inhibition of protein aggregation by SRCP1.",

In the experiment, cells display a range of collective migration patterns, including uncorrelated motion, formation of partially localized streams, and clumping, depending on the type of cell and the strength of the external, linear concentration gradient of the signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). From our model, we find that the pattern of migration can be quantitatively described by the competition of two processes, the secretion rate of cAMP by the cells and the degradation rate of cAMP in the gradient chamber. Model simulations are compared to experiments for a wide range of strengths of an external linear-gradient signal. With degradation, the model secreting cells form streams and efficiently transverse the gradient, but without degradation, we find that model secreting cells form clumps without streaming. This indicates that the observed effective collective migration in streams requires not only signal relay but also degradation of the signal. In addition, our model allows us to detect and quantify precursors of correlated motion, even when cells do not exhibit obvious streaming.",

Using Fourier traction force microscopy, we measured the spatiotemporal evolution of shape and traction stresses and constructed traction tension kymographs to analyze cell motility as a function of the dynamics of the cell's mechanically active traction adhesions. We show that wild-type cells migrate in a step-wise fashion, mainly forming stationary traction adhesions along their anterior-posterior axes and exerting strong contractile axial forces. We demonstrate that lateral forces are also important for motility, especially for migration on highly adhesive substrates. Analysis of two mutant strains lacking distinct actin cross-linkers (mhcA(-) and abp120(-) cells) on normal and highly adhesive substrates supports a key role for lateral contractions in amoeboid cell motility, whereas the differences in their traction adhesion dynamics suggest that these two strains use distinct mechanisms to achieve migration.

        "abstract": "Self and kin discrimination are observed in most kingdoms of life and are mediated by highly polymorphic plasma membrane proteins. Sequence polymorphism, which is essential for effective recognition, is maintained by balancing selection. Dictyostelium discoideum are social amoebas that propagate as unicellular organisms but aggregate upon starvation and form fruiting bodies with viable spores and dead stalk cells. Aggregative development exposes Dictyostelium to the perils of chimerism, including cheating, which raises questions about how the victims survive in nature and how social cooperation persists. Dictyostelids can minimize the cost of chimerism by preferential cooperation with kin, but the mechanisms of kin discrimination are largely unknown. Dictyostelium lag genes encode transmembrane proteins with multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) repeats that participate in cell adhesion and signaling. Here, we describe their role in kin discrimination. We show that lagB1 and lagC1 are highly polymorphic in natural populations and that their sequence dissimilarity correlates well with wild-strain segregation. Deleting lagB1 and lagC1 results in strain segregation in chimeras with wild-type cells, whereas elimination of the nearly invariant homolog lagD1 has no such consequences. These findings reveal an early evolutionary origin of kin discrimination and provide insight into the mechanism of social recognition and immunity.",

        "abstract": "Cell-substrate adhesion of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a model organism often used for the study of chemotaxis, is non-specific and does not involve focal adhesion complexes. Therefore, micropatterned substrates where adherent Dictyostelium cells are constrained to designated microscopic regions are difficult to make. Here we present a micropatterning technique for Dictyostelium cells that relies on coating the substrate with an \u223c1\u03bcm thick layer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel. We show that, when plated on a substrate with narrow parallel stripes of PEG-gel and glass, Dictyostelium cells nearly exclusive adhere to and migrate along the glass stripes, thus providing a model system to study one-dimensional migration of amoeboid cells. Surprisingly, we find substantial differences in the adhesion to PEG-gel and glass stripes between vegetative and developed cells and between two different axenic laboratory strains of Dictyostelium, AX2 and AX4. Even more surprisingly, we find that the distribution of Dictyostelium cells between PEG-gel and glass stripes is significantly affected by the expression of several fluorescent protein markers of the cytoskeleton. We carry out atomic force microscopy based single cell force spectroscopy measurements that confirm that the force of adhesion to PEG-gel substrate can be significantly different between vegetative and developed cells, AX2 and AX4 cells, and cells with and without fluorescent markers. Thus, the choice of parental background, the degree of development, and the expression of fluorescent protein markers can all have a profound effect on cell-substrate adhesion and should be considered when comparing migration of cells and when designing micropatterned substrates.",

        "abstract": "This review focusses on the functions of intracellular and extracellular calmodulin, its target proteins and their binding proteins during the asexual life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum. Calmodulin is a primary regulatory protein of calcium signal transduction that functions throughout all stages. During growth, it mediates autophagy, the cell cycle, folic acid chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and other functions. During mitosis, specific calmodulin-binding proteins translocate to alternative locations. Translocation of at least one cell adhesion protein is calmodulin dependent. When starved, cells undergo calmodulin-dependent chemotaxis to cyclic AMP generating a multicellular pseudoplasmodium. Calmodulin-dependent signalling within the slug sets up a defined pattern and polarity that sets the stage for the final events of morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Transected slugs undergo calmodulin-dependent transdifferentiation to re-establish the disrupted pattern and polarity. Calmodulin function is critical for stalk cell differentiation but also functions in spore formation, events that begin in the pseudoplasmodium. The asexual life cycle restarts with the calmodulin-dependent germination of spores. Specific calmodulin-binding proteins as well as some of their binding partners have been linked to each of these events. The functions of extracellular calmodulin during growth and development are also discussed. This overview brings to the forefront the central role of calmodulin, working through its numerous binding proteins, as a primary downstream regulator of the critical calcium signalling pathways that have been well established in this model eukaryote. This is the first time the function of calmodulin and its target proteins have been documented through the complete life cycle of any eukaryote.",

In particular, the local excitation and global inhibition (LEGI) model has proven capable of providing a framework for quantitatively explaining many experiments that present Dictyostelium cells with tailored chemical stimuli and monitor their subsequent polarization. In their natural setting, cells generate their own directional signals via the detection and secretion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Here, we couple the LEGI approach to an excitable medium model of the cAMP wave-field that is propagated by the cells and investigate the possibility for this class of models to enable accurate chemotaxis to the cAMP waveforms expected in vivo. Our results indicate that the ultra-sensitive version of the model does an excellent job in providing natural wave rectification, thereby providing a compelling solution to the 'back-of-the-wave paradox' during cellular aggregation.",

TMEM16-like genes are present in the genomes of most eukaryotic species, the function(s) of TMEM16 family members from evolutionary ancient eukaryotes is not completely clear. Here, we provide insight into the evolution of these TMEM16 proteins by similarity searches for ancestral sequences. All eukaryotic genomes contain TMEM16 homologs, but only vertebrates have the full repertoire of ten distinct subtypes. TMEM16 homologs studied so far belong to the opisthokont branch of the phylogenetic tree, which includes the animal and fungal kingdoms. An organism outside this group is Dictyostelium discoideum, a representative of the amoebozoa group that diverged from the metazoa before fungi. We here functionally investigated the TMEM16 family member from Dictyostelium discoideum. When recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells, DdTMEM16 induces phospholipid scrambling.

A prominent example that is seen during wound healing is fibroblast migration in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) gradients. As in the well-characterized chemotactic cells Dictyostelium discoideum and neutrophils, signaling to the cytoskeleton via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway in fibroblasts is spatially polarized by a PDGF gradient; however, the sensitivity of this process and how it is regulated are unknown. Through a quantitative analysis of mathematical models and live cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy experiments, we demonstrate that PDGF detection is governed by mechanisms that are fundamentally different from those in D. discoideum and neutrophils. Robust PDGF sensing requires steeper gradients and a much narrower range of absolute chemoattractant concentration, which is consistent with a simpler system lacking the feedback loops that yield signal amplification and adaptation in amoeboid cells.",

        "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Bordetella species have a significant life stage outside of the mammalian respiratory tract that has yet to be defined. The Bordetella virulence gene (BvgAS) two-component system, a paradigm for a global virulence regulon, controls the expression of many \"virulence factors\" expressed in the Bvg positive (Bvg+) phase that are necessary for successful respiratory tract infection. A similarly large set of highly conserved genes are expressed under Bvg negative (Bvg-) phase growth conditions; however, these appear to be primarily expressed outside of the host and are thus hypothesized to be important in an undefined extrahost reservoir. Here, we show that Bvg- phase genes are involved in the ability of Bordetella bronchiseptica to grow and disseminate via the complex life cycle of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Unlike bacteria that serve as an amoeba food source, B. bronchiseptica evades amoeba predation, survives within the amoeba for extended periods of time, incorporates itself into the amoeba sori, and disseminates along with the amoeba. Remarkably, B. bronchiseptica continues to be transferred with the amoeba for months, through multiple life cycles of amoebae grown on the lawns of other bacteria, thus demonstrating a stable relationship that allows B. bronchiseptica to expand and disperse geographically via the D. discoideum life cycle. Furthermore, B. bronchiseptica within the sori can efficiently infect mice, indicating that amoebae may represent an environmental vector within which pathogenic bordetellae expand and disseminate to encounter new mammalian hosts. These data identify amoebae as potential environmental reservoirs as well as amplifying and disseminating vectors for B. bronchiseptica and reveal an important role for the Bvg- phase in these interactions.",

Here we identify a weakly related gene in the genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, and show, with the use of heterologous expression in human embryonic kidney cells, that it encodes a membrane ion channel activated by ATP (30-100 muM). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed essential conservation of structure-function relations with P2X receptors of higher organisms. The receptor was insensitive to the usual P2X antagonists but was blocked by nanomolar concentrations of Cu2+ ions. In D. discoideum, the receptor was found on intracellular membranes, with prominent localization to an osmoregulatory organelle, the contractile vacuole. Targeted disruption of the gene in D. discoideum resulted in cells that were unable to regulate cell volume in hypotonic conditions. Cell swelling in these mutant cells was accompanied by a marked inhibition of contractile vacuole emptying. These findings demonstrate a new functional role for P2X receptors on intracellular organelles, in this case in osmoregulation.",

The accuracy of this process is limited by stochastic fluctuations in the concentration of the external signal and in the internal signaling components. Here we use information theory to determine the optimal scheme to detect the location of an external chemoattractant source in the presence of noise. We compute the minimum amount of mutual information needed between the chemoattractant gradient and the internal signal to achieve a prespecified chemotactic accuracy. We show that more accurate chemotaxis requires greater mutual information. We also demonstrate that a priori information can improve chemotaxis efficiency. We compare the optimal signaling schemes with existing experimental measurements and models of eukaryotic gradient sensing. Remarkably, there is good quantitative agreement between the optimal response when no a priori assumption is made about the location of the existing source, and the observed experimental response of unpolarized Dictyostelium discoideum cells. In contrast, the measured response of polarized D. discoideum cells matches closely the optimal scheme, assuming prior knowledge of the external gradient-for example, through prolonged chemotaxis in a given direction. Our results demonstrate that different observed classes of responses in cells (polarized and unpolarized) are optimal under varying information assumptions.",

Ceramidases (CDases) are currently classified into three categories (acid, neutral and alkaline) based on their optimal pHs and primary structures. Here, we report the first exception to this rule. We cloned the CDase cDNA, consisting of 2142 nucleotides encoding 714 amino-acid residues, from the slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum. The putative amino-acid sequence indicates 32-42% identity with various neutral CDases, but does not show any similarity to the acid and alkaline CDases, indicating the enzyme should be classified as a neutral CDase. However, overexpression of the cDNA in D. discoideum resulted in increased CDase activity at an acidic, but not a neutral pH range. Knockout of the gene in slime mould eliminated CDase activity at acidic pH. The recombinant enzyme expressed in the slime mould was purified and then characterized. Consequently, the purified CDase was found to exhibit the maximal activity at approx. pH 3.0. The singular pH dependency of slime mould CDase is not derived from the specific post-translational modification in the slime mould, because the enzyme showed an acidic pH optimum even when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whereas rat neutral-CDase exhibited a neutral pH optimum when expressed in slime mould.",

        "abstract": "Cells have the ability to detect electric fields and respond to them with directed migratory movement. Investigations identified genes and proteins that play important roles in defining the migration efficiency. Nevertheless, the sensing and transduction mechanisms underlying directed cell migration are still under discussion. We use Dictyostelium discoideum cells as model system for studying eukaryotic cell migration in DC electric fields. We have defined the temporal electric persistence to characterize the memory that cells have in a varying electric field. In addition to imposing a directional bias, we observed that the electric field influences the cellular kinematics by accelerating the movement of cells along their paths. Moreover, the study of vegetative and briefly starved cells provided insight into the electrical sensing of cells. We found evidence that conditioned medium of starved cells was able to trigger the electrical sensing of vegetative cells that would otherwise not orient themselves in the electric field. This observation may be explained by the presence of the conditioned medium factor (CMF), a protein secreted by the cells, when they begin to starve. The results of this study give new insights into understanding the mechanism that triggers the electrical sensing and transduces the external stimulus into directed cell migration. Finally, the observed increased mobility of cells over time in an electric field could offer a novel perspective towards wound healing assays.",

        "abstract": "Amoebae of the Dictyostelium discoideum species form multicellular fruiting bodies upon starvation. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is used as intercellular signalling molecule in cell-aggregation, cell differentiation and morphogenesis. This molecule is synthesized by three adenylyl cyclases, one of which, ACA, is required for cell aggregation. The gene coding for ACA (acaA) is transcribed from three different promoters that are active at different developmental stages. Promoter 1 is active during cell-aggregation, promoters 2 and 3 are active in prespore and prestalk tip cells at subsequent developmental stages. The biological relevance of acaA expression from each of the promoters has been studied in this article. The acaA gene was expressed in acaA-mutant cells, that do not aggregate, under control of each of the three acaA promoters. acaA expression under promoter 1 control induced cell aggregation although subsequent development was delayed, very small fruiting bodies were formed and cell differentiation genes were expressed at very low levels. Promoter 2-driven acaA expression induced the formation of small aggregates and small fruiting bodies were formed at the same time as in wild-type strains and differentiation genes were also expressed at lower levels. Expression of acaA from promoter 3 induced aggregates and fruiting bodies formation and their size and the expression of differentiation genes were more similar to that of wild-type cells. Expression of acaA from promoters 1 and 2 in AX4 cells also produced smaller structures. In conclusion, the expression of acaA under control of the aggregation-specific Promoter 1 is able to induce cell aggregation in acaA-mutant strains. Expression from promoters 2 and 3 also recovered aggregation and development although promoter 3 induced a more complete recovery of fruiting body formation.",

        "abstract": "Post-transcriptional processes mediated by mRNA binding proteins represent important control points in gene expression. In eukaryotes, mRNAs containing specific AU-rich motifs are regulated by binding of tristetraprolin (TTP) family tandem zinc finger proteins, which promote mRNA deadenylation and decay, partly through interaction of a conserved C-terminal CNOT1 binding (CNB) domain with CCR4-NOT protein complexes. The social ameba Dictyostelium discoideum shared a common ancestor with humans more than a billion years ago, and expresses only one TTP family protein, TtpA, in contrast to three members expressed in humans. Evaluation of ttpA null-mutants identified six transcripts that were consistently upregulated compared to WT during growth and early development. The 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of all six 'TtpA-target' mRNAs contained multiple TTP binding motifs (UUAUUUAUU), and one 3'-UTR conferred TtpA post-transcriptional stability regulation to a heterologous mRNA that was abrogated by mutations in the core TTP-binding motifs. All six target transcripts were upregulated to similar extents in a\u00a0C-terminal truncation mutant, in contrast to less severe effects of analogous mutants in mice. All six target transcripts encoded probable membrane proteins. In Dictyostelium, TtpA may control an 'RNA regulon', where a single RNA binding protein, TtpA, post-transcriptionally co-regulates expression of several functionally related proteins.",

        "abstract": "Tight control of actin cytoskeletal dynamics is essential for proper cell function and survival. Arf nucleotide binding-site opener (ARNO), a mammalian guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf, has been implicated in actin cytoskeletal regulation but its exact role is still unknown. To explore the role of ARNO in this regulation as well as in actin-mediated processes, the Dictyostelium discoideum homolog, SecG, was examined. SecG peaks during aggregation and mound formation. The overexpression of SecG arrests development at the mound stage. SecG overexpressing (SecG OE) cells fail to stream during aggregation. Although carA is expressed, SecG OE cells do not chemotax toward cAMP, indicating SecG is involved in the cellular response to cAMP. This chemotactic defect is specific to cAMP-directed chemotaxis, as SecG OE cells chemotax to folate without impairment and exhibit normal cell motility. The chemotactic defects of the SecG mutants may be due to an impaired cAMP response as evidenced by altered cell polarity and F-actin polymerization after cAMP stimulation. Cells overexpressing SecG have increased filopodia compared to wild type cells, implying that excess SecG causes abnormal organization of F-actin. The general function of the cytoskeleton, however, is not disrupted as the SecG OE cells exhibit proper cell-substrate adhesion. Taken together, the results suggest proper SecG levels are needed for appropriate response to cAMP signaling in order to coordinate F-actin organization during development.",

We found that when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a D. discoideum cDNA that encodes the ribosomal protein S4 (DdS4) rescues mutations in the cell cycle genes cdc24, cdc42 and bem1. The products of these genes affect morphogenesis in yeast via a coordinated moulding of the cytoskeleton during bud site selection. D. discoideum cells that over- or under-expressed DdS4 did not show detectable changes in protein synthesis but displayed similar developmental aberrations whose intensity was graded with the extent of over- or under-expression. This suggested that DdS4 might influence morphogenesis via a stoichiometric effect--specifically, by taking part in a multimeric complex similar to the one involving Cdc24p, Cdc42p and Bem1p in yeast. In support of the hypothesis, the S. cerevisiae proteins Cdc24p, Cdc42p and Bem1p as well as their D. discoideum cognates could be co-precipitated with antibodies to DdS4. Computational analysis and mutational studies explained these findings: a C-terminal domain of DdS4 is the functional equivalent of an SH3 domain in the yeast scaffold protein Bem1p that is central to constructing the bud site selection complex. Thus in addition to being part of the ribosome, DdS4 has a second function, also as part of a multi-protein complex. We speculate that the existence of the second role can act as a safeguard against perturbations to ribosome function caused by spontaneous variations in DdS4 levels.",

        "abstract": "Phagocytic cells ingest bacteria by phagocytosis and kill them efficiently inside phagolysosomes. The molecular mechanisms involved in intracellular killing and their regulation are complex and still incompletely understood. Dictyostelium discoideum has been used as a model to discover and to study new gene products involved in intracellular killing of ingested bacteria. In this study, we performed random mutagenesis of Dictyostelium cells and isolated a mutant defective for growth on bacteria. This mutant is characterized by the genetic inactivation of the lrrkA gene, which encodes a protein with a kinase domain and leucine-rich repeats. LrrkA knockout (KO) cells kill ingested Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria inefficiently. This defect is not additive to the killing defect observed in kil2 KO cells, suggesting that the function of Kil2 is partially controlled by LrrkA. Indeed, lrrkA KO cells exhibit a phenotype similar to that of kil2 KO cells: Intraphagosomal proteolysis is inefficient, and both intraphagosomal killing and proteolysis are restored upon exogenous supplementation with magnesium ions. Bacterially secreted folate stimulates intracellular killing in Dictyostelium cells, but this stimulation is lost in cells with genetic inactivation of kil2, lrrkA, or far1. Together, these results indicate that the stimulation of intracellular killing by folate involves Far1 (the cell surface receptor for folate), LrrkA, and Kil2. This study is the first identification of a signalling pathway regulating intraphagosomal bacterial killing in Dictyostelium cells.",

Dictyostelium\u00a0discoideum has six copine genes (cpnA-cpnF), and cells lacking cpnA(cpnA<sup>-</sup> ) have defects in cytokinesis, chemotaxis, adhesion, and development. CpnA has also been shown to associate with the plasma membrane, contractile vacuoles (CV), and organelles of the endolysosomal pathway. Here, we use cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells to investigate the role of CpnA in CV function and endocytosis. When placed in water, cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells made abnormally large CVs that took longer to expel. Visualization of CVs with the marker protein GFP-dajumin indicated that cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells had fewer CVs that sometimes refilled before complete emptying. In endocytosis assays, cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells took up small fluorescent beads by macropinocytosis at rates similar to parental cells. However, cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells reached a plateau sooner than parental cells and had less fluorescence at later time points. p80 antibody labeling of postlysosomes (PL) indicated that there were fewer and smaller PLs in cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells. In dextran pulse-chase experiments, the number of PLs peaked earlier in cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells, and the PLs did not become as large and disappeared sooner as compared to parental cells. PLs in cpnA<sup>-</sup> cells were also shown to have more actin coats, suggesting CpnA may play a role in actin filament disassembly on PL membranes. Overall, these results indicate that CpnA is involved in the regulation of CV size and expulsion, and the maturation, size, and exocytosis of PLs.",

Transient elevations of calcium concentration play a key role in the activation of cells following mechanical stress, but it is still unclear how eukaryotic cells convert a mechanical signal into an ion flux. In this study, we used the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum to assess systematically the role of individual calcium channels in mechanosensing. Our results indicate that PKD2 is the major player in the cell response to rheotaxis (i.e., shear-flow induced mechanical motility), while other putative calcium channels play at most minor roles. Mutant pkd2 KO cells lose the ability to orient relative to a shear flow, whereas their ability to move towards a chemoattractant is unaffected. PKD2 is also important for calcium-induced lysosome exocytosis: WT cells show a transient, 2-fold increase in lysosome secretion upon sudden exposure to high levels of extracellular calcium, but pkd2 KO cells do not. In Dictyostelium, PKD2 is specifically localized at the plasma membrane, where it may generate calcium influxes in response to mechanical stress or extracellular calcium changes.",

In addition to gene disruption, acute pharmacological abrogation of protein activity can be a powerful tool to identify the protein's role in the biology of the organism. We analysed the effects of a range of compounds on the activity of ACA, ACB and ACG to identify enzyme-specific modulators. Caffeine, which was previously used to specifically block ACA function, also inhibited cAMP accumulation by ACB and ACG. IPA (2',3'-O-isopropylidene adenosine) specifically inhibits ACA when measured in intact cells, without affecting ACB or ACG. All three enzymes are inhibited by the P-site inhibitor DDA (2',5'-dideoxyadenosine) when assayed in cell lysates, but not in intact cells. Tyrphostin A25 [alpha-cyano-(3,4,5-trihydroxy)cinnamonitrile] and SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2'-furyl)adenine] proved to be effective and specific inhibitors for ACG and ACA respectively. Both compounds acted directly on enzyme activity assayed in cell lysates, but only SQ22536 was also a specific inhibitor when added to intact cells.",

Analysis of AX2 cells over-expressing truncated and full length CEP161 proteins revealed defects in growth and development. By immunoprecipitation experiments we identified the Hippo related kinase SvkA (Hrk-svk) as binding partner for CEP161. Both proteins colocalize at the centrosome. In in vitro kinase assays the N-terminal domain of CEP161 (residues 1-763) inhibited the kinase activity of Hrk-svk.

In this organism, eight of 18 mt-tRNAs are predicted to be edited based on the presence of genomically encoded mismatched nucleotides in their aminoacyl-acceptor stem sequences. Here, we demonstrate that mt-tRNA 5'-editing occurs at all predicted sites in D. discoideum as evidenced by changes in the sequences of isolated mt-tRNAs compared with the expected sequences encoded by the mitochondrial genome. We also identify two previously unpredicted editing events in which G-U base pairs are edited in the absence of any other genomically encoded mismatches. A comparison of 5'-editing in D. discoideum with 5'-editing in another slime mold, Polysphondylium pallidum, suggests organism-specific idiosyncrasies in the treatment of U-G/G-U pairs. In vitro activities of putative D. discoideum editing enzymes are consistent with the observed editing reactions and suggest an overall lack of tRNA substrate specificity exhibited by the repair component of the editing enzyme. Although the presence of terminal mismatches in mt-tRNA sequences is highly predictive of the occurrence of mt-tRNA 5'-editing, the variability in treatment of U-G/G-U base pairs observed here indicates that direct experimental evidence of 5'-editing must be obtained to understand the complete spectrum of mt-tRNA editing events in any species.",

These receptors activate a common molecular switch that is represented by the heterotrimeric G-protein generating a number of second messengers (cAMP, cGMP, DAG, IP3, Ca<sup>2+</sup> etc.), leading to a plethora of diverse cellular responses. Spatiotemporal regulation of signals generated by a given GPCR is crucial for proper signalling and is accomplished by a series of biochemical modifications. Over the past few years, it has become evident that many signalling proteins also undergo ubiquitination, a posttranslational modification that typically leads to protein degradation, but also mediates processes such as protein-protein interaction and protein subcellular localization. The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> has proven to be an excellent model to investigate signal transduction triggered by GPCR activation, as cAMP signalling via GPCR is a major regulator of chemotaxis, cell differentiation, and multicellular morphogenesis. Ubiquitin ligases have been recently involved in these processes. In the present review, we will summarize the most significant pathways activated upon GPCRs stimulation and discuss the role played by ubiquitination in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells.",

        "abstract": "Calcium acts as a second messenger to regulate many cellular functions, including cell motility. In Dictyostelium discoideum, the cytosolic calcium level oscillates synchronously, and calcium waves propagate through the cell population during the early stages of development, including aggregation. In the unicellular phase, the calcium response through Piezo channels also functions in mechanosensing. However, calcium dynamics during multicellular morphogenesis are still unclear. Here, live imaging of cytosolic calcium revealed that calcium wave propagation, depending on cAMP relay, disappeared at the onset of multicellular body (slug) formation. Later, other forms of occasional calcium bursts and their propagation were observed in both anterior and posterior regions of migrating slugs. This calcium signaling also occurred in response to mechanical stimuli. Two pathways-calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum via IP3 receptor and calcium influx from outside the cell-were involved in calcium signals induced by mechanical stimuli. These data suggest that calcium signaling is involved in mechanosensing in both the unicellular and multicellular phases of Dictyostelium development using different molecular mechanisms.",

PAMP-recognition machinery is evolutionarily conserved, allowing for characterization in model organisms. The model organism Dictyostelium discoideum can exist as single-celled amoebae, which phagocytize bacteria for nutrients. Although D. discoideum is used extensively to study phagocytosis, it has not been determined if D. discoideum detects bacterial PAMPs using pattern-recognition machinery. Here we show that D. discoideum mounts responses against the bacterial cell wall PAMP, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upon treatment with LPS or its active component Lipid A, D. discoideum cells more efficiently clear phagocytized bacteria. LPS-enhanced bactericidal activity appears dependent both on MAPK signaling pathways as well as on the D. discoideum toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing protein, TirA. These findings indicate that pattern-recognition machinery required to detect and respond to bacterial PAMPs may be conserved in D. discoideum.",

        "abstract": "While GABA has been suggested to regulate spore encapsulation in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, the metabolic profile and other potential functions of GABA during development remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the homeostasis of GABA metabolism by disrupting genes related to GABA metabolism and signaling. Extracellular levels of GABA are tightly regulated during early development, and GABA is generated by the glutamate decarboxylase, GadB, during growth and in early development. However, overexpression of the prespore-specific homologue, GadA, in the presence of GadB reduces production of extracellular GABA. Perturbation of extracellular GABA levels delays the process of aggregation. Cytosolic GABA is degraded by the GABA transaminase, GabT, in the mitochondria. Disruption of a putative vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) homologue DdvGAT reduces secreted GABA. We identified the GABAB receptor-like family member GrlB as the major GABA receptor during early development, and either disruption or overexpression of GrlB delays aggregation. This delay is likely the result of an abolished pre-starvation response and late expression of several \"early\" developmental genes. Distinct genes are employed for GABA generation during sporulation. During sporulation, GadA alone is required for generating GABA and DdvGAT is likely responsible for GABA secretion. GrlE but not GrlB is the GABA receptor during late development.",

All compounds showed near-neutral pKas (ranging 6.28\u22126.97), chemical shifts not overlapping those of phosphorus metabolites, and spectroscopic sensitivities (i.e., chemical shifts variation \u0394\u03b4ab between the acidic and basic forms) ranging from 9.2\u221210.7 ppm, being fourfold larger than conventional endogenous markers such as inorganic phosphate. X-ray crystallographic studies combined with predictive empirical relationships and ab initio calculations addressed the inductive and stereochemical effects of substituents linked to the protonated amine function. Satisfactory correlations were established between pKas and both the 2D structure and pyramidalization at phosphorus, showing that steric crowding around the phosphorus is crucial for modulating \u0394\u03b4ab.

We report that natural isolates of Enterobacteriaceae that actively hydrolyze plant-derived aromatic \u03b2-glucosides such as salicin, arbutin and esculin, are able to avoid predation by the bacteriovorous amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and nematodes of multiple genera belonging to the family Rhabditidae. This advantage can be observed under laboratory culture conditions as well as in the soil environment. The aglycone moiety released by the hydrolysis of \u03b2-glucosides is toxic to predators and acts via the dopaminergic receptor Dop-1 in the case of Caenorhabditis elegans. While soil isolates of nematodes belonging to the family Rhabditidae are repelled by the aglycone, laboratory strains and natural isolates of Caenorhabditis sp. are attracted to the compound, mediated by receptors that are independent of Dop-1, leading to their death. The \u03b2-glucosides-positive (Bgl(+)) bacteria that are otherwise non-pathogenic can obtain additional nutrients from the dead predators, thereby switching their role from prey to predator. This study also offers an evolutionary explanation for the retention by bacteria of 'cryptic' or 'silent' genetic systems such as the bgl operon.",

        "abstract": "Neddylation is a post-translational modification that is essential for a variety of cellular processes and is linked to many human diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmune disorders. Neddylation involves the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modifier neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to target proteins, and has been studied extensively in various eukaryotes including fungi, plants, and metazoans. Here, we examine the biological processes influenced by neddylation in the social amoeba, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, using a well-established inhibitor of neddylation, MLN4924 (pevonedistat). NEDD8, and the target of MLN4924 inhibition, NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), are highly conserved in <i>D. discoideum</i> (Nedd8 and Nae1, respectively). Treatment of <i>D. discoideum</i> cells with MLN4924 increased the amount of free Nedd8, suggesting that MLN4924 inhibited neddylation. During growth, MLN4924 suppressed cell proliferation and folic acid-mediated chemotaxis. During multicellular development, MLN4924 inhibited cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated chemotaxis, delayed aggregation, and suppressed fruiting body formation. Together, these findings indicate that neddylation plays an important role in regulating cellular and developmental events during the <i>D. discoideum</i> life cycle and that this organism can be used as a model system to better understand the essential roles of neddylation in eukaryotes, and consequently, its involvement in human disease.",

However, most studies deal only with one cooperative behaviour, even though some organisms perform two or more cooperative behaviours. The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> performs two cooperative behaviours in starvation: fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation. Here, we constructed a model that couples these two behaviours, and we found that the two behaviours are maintained because of the emergence of cyclic dominance, although cooperation cannot evolve if only either of the two behaviours is performed. The common chemoattractant cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) is used in both fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation, providing a biological context for this coupling. Cyclic dominance emerges regardless of the existence of mating types or spatial structure in the model. In addition, cooperation can re-emerge in the population even after it goes extinct. These results indicate that the two cooperative behaviours of the social amoeba are maintained because of the common chemical signal that underlies both fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation. We demonstrate the importance of coupling multiple games when the underlying behaviours are associated with one another.",

        "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila is an amoeba-resistant bacterium, which also replicates in alveolar macrophages thus causing the severe pneumonia \"Legionnaires' disease\"(1). In protozoan and mammalian phagocytes, L. pneumophila employs a conserved mechanism to form a specific, replication-permissive compartment, the \"Legionella-containing vacuole\" (LCV). LCV formation requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates as many as 275 \"effector\" proteins into host cells. The effectors manipulate host proteins as well as lipids and communicate with secretory, endosomal and mitochondrial organelles(2-4). The formation of LCVs represents a complex, robust and redundant process, which is difficult to grasp in a reductionist manner. An integrative approach is required to comprehensively understand LCV formation, including a global analysis of pathogen-host factor interactions and their temporal and spatial dynamics. As a first step towards this goal, intact LCVs are purified and analyzed by proteomics and lipidomics. The composition and formation of pathogen-containing vacuoles has been investigated by proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography or 2-D gel electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry. Vacuoles isolated from either the social soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum or mammalian phagocytes harboured Leishmania(5), Listeria(6), Mycobacterium(7), Rhodococcus(8), Salmonella(9) or Legionella spp.(10). However, the purification protocols employed in these studies are time-consuming and tedious, as they require e.g. electron microscopy to analyse LCV morphology, integrity and purity. Additionally, these protocols do not exploit specific features of the pathogen vacuole for enrichment. The method presented here overcomes these limitations by employing D. discoideum producing a fluorescent LCV marker and by targeting the bacterial effector protein SidC, which selectively anchors to the LCV membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P)(3,11) . LCVs are enriched in a first step by immuno-magnetic separation using an affinity-purified primary antibody against SidC and a secondary antibody coupled to magnetic beads, followed in a second step by a classical Histodenz density gradient centrifugation(12,13) (Fig. 1). A proteome study of isolated LCVs from D. discoideum revealed more than 560 host cell proteins, including proteins associated with phagocytic vesicles, mitochondria, ER and Golgi, as well as several GTPases, which have not been implicated in LCV formation before(13). LCVs enriched and purified with the protocol outlined here can be further analyzed by microscopy (immunofluorescence, electron microscopy), biochemical methods (Western blot) and proteomic or lipidomic approaches.",

In prokaryotes, a major poly P synthetic enzyme is poly P kinase 1 (PPK1), which is found in 100 bacterial genomes, including numerous pathogens. Null mutants of PPK1, with low poly P levels, are defective in survival: namely, they show defective responses to physical/chemical stresses and predation. Pathogens with a PPK1 deletion are defective in biofilm formation, quorum sensing, general stress and stringent responses, motility, and other virulence properties. With the exception of Dictyostelium, PPK1 is absent in eukaryotes and provides a novel target for chemotherapy that would affect both virulence and susceptibility to antibacterial compounds. Remarkably, another PPK in Dictyostelium discoideum (PPK2) is an actin-related protein (Arp) complex that is polymerized into an actin-like filament, concurrent with its reversible synthesis of a poly P chain from ATP.",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotic cells are able to crawl on surfaces and guide their motility based on environmental cues. These cues are interpreted by signaling systems which couple to cell mechanics; indeed membrane protrusions in crawling cells are often accompanied by activated membrane patches, which are localized areas of increased concentration of one or more signaling components. To determine how these patches are related to cell motion, we examine the spatial localization of RasGTP in chemotaxing Dictyostelium discoideum cells under conditions where the vertical extent of the cell was restricted. Quantitative analyses of the data reveal a high degree of spatial correlation between patches of activated Ras and membrane protrusions. Based on these findings, we formulate a model for amoeboid cell motion that consists of two coupled modules. The first module utilizes a recently developed two-component reaction diffusion model that generates transient and localized areas of elevated concentration of one of the components along the membrane. The activated patches determine the location of membrane protrusions (and overall cell motion) that are computed in the second module, which also takes into account the cortical tension and the availability of protrusion resources. We show that our model is able to produce realistic amoeboid-like motion and that our numerical results are consistent with experimentally observed pseudopod dynamics. Specifically, we show that the commonly observed splitting of pseudopods can result directly from the dynamics of the signaling patches.",

        "abstract": "During a tuberculosis infection and inside lipid-laden foamy macrophages, fatty acids (FAs) and sterols are the major energy and carbon source for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacteria can be found both inside a vacuole and the cytosol, but how this impacts their access to lipids is not well appreciated. Lipid droplets (LDs) store FAs in form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and are energy reservoirs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Using the Dictyostelium discoideum/Mycobacterium marinum infection model we showed that M. marinum accesses host LDs to build up its own intracytosolic lipid inclusions (ILIs). Here, we show that host LDs aggregate at regions of the bacteria that become exposed to the cytosol, and appear to coalesce on their hydrophobic surface leading to a transfer of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2)-GFP onto the bacteria. Dictyostelium knockout mutants for both Dgat enzymes are unable to generate LDs. Instead, the excess of exogenous FAs is esterified predominantly into phospholipids, inducing uncontrolled proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Strikingly, in absence of host LDs, M. marinum alternatively exploits these phospholipids, resulting in rapid reversal of ER-proliferation. In addition, the bacteria are unable to restrict their acquisition of lipids from the dgat1&2 double knockout leading to vast accumulation of ILIs. Recent data indicate that the presence of ILIs is one of the characteristics of dormant mycobacteria. During Dictyostelium infection, ILI formation in M. marinum is not accompanied by a significant change in intracellular growth and a reduction in metabolic activity, thus providing evidence that storage of neutral lipids does not necessarily induce dormancy.",

CudA is a nuclear protein which is expressed in prespore cells where it acts as a specific transcription factor. CudA is also expressed in an anteriorly located group of cells, the tip-organiser, that is believed to constitute the functional tip. We identify an expansin-like gene, expl7, that is expressed within the tip-organiser region and which is not expressed in a cudA null strain. The expl7 promoter contains a region that binds to CudA in vitro and this region is necessary for expression in the tip-organiser. These results provide an end-point for a previously defined signal transduction pathway in which regionalized expression of the ACA adenylyl cyclase within the tip-organiser leads to localised cAMP-induced activation of STATa and consequent binding of STATa to the cudA promoter. STATa then induces expression of cudA and cudA directs the transcription of target genes such as expl7.",

        "abstract": "Defects in mitochondrial dynamics, fission, fusion, and motility have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Another key feature of neurodegeneration is the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous work has shown that the cytoskeleton, in particular the microtubules, and ROS generated by rotenone significantly regulate mitochondrial dynamics in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum.</i> The goal of this project is to study the effects of ROS on mitochondrial dynamics within our model organism <i>D. discoideum</i> to further understand the underlying issues that are the root of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We chose three likely ROS inducers, cumene hydroperoxide, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and Antimycin A. Our work demonstrates that alteration of the microtubule cytoskeleton is not required to alter dynamics in response to ROS and there is no easy way to predict how mitochondrial dynamics will be altered based on which ROS generator is used. This research contributes to the better understanding of the cellular mechanisms that induce the pathogenesis of incurable neurodegenerative diseases with the hope that it will translate into developing new and more effective treatments for patients afflicted by them.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is the most common childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease. NCL is inevitably fatal, and there is currently no treatment available. Children with NCL show a progressive decline in movement, vision and mental abilities, and an accumulation of autofluorescent deposits in neurons and other cell types. Late-infantile NCL is caused by mutations in the lysosomal protease tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). TPP1 cleaves tripeptides from the N-terminus of proteins in vitro, but little is known about the physiological function of TPP1. TPP1 shows wide conservation in vertebrates but it is not found in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we characterize ddTpp1, a TPP1 ortholog present in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Lysates from cells lacking ddTpp1 show a reduced but not abolished ability to cleave a TPP1 substrate, suggesting that other Dictyostelium enzymes can perform this cleavage. ddTpp1 and human TPP1 localize to the lysosome in Dictyostelium, indicating conserved function and trafficking. Cells that lack ddTpp1 show precocious multicellular development and a reduced ability to form spores during development. When cultured in autophagy-stimulating conditions, cells lacking ddTpp1 rapidly decrease in size and are less viable than wild-type cells, suggesting that one function of ddTpp1 could be to limit autophagy. Cells that lack ddTpp1 exhibit strongly impaired development in the presence of the lysosome-perturbing drug chloroquine, and this phenotype can be suppressed through a secondary mutation in the gene that we name suppressor of tpp1(-) A (stpA), which encodes a protein with some similarity to mammalian oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs). Taken together, these results suggest that targeting specific proteins could be a viable way to suppress the effects of loss of TPP1 function.",

        "abstract": "Francisella bacteria cause severe disease in both vertebrates and invertebrates and include one of the most infectious human pathogens. Mammalian cell lines have mainly been used to study the mechanisms by which Francisella manipulates its host to replicate within a large variety of hosts and cell types, including macrophages. Here, we describe the establishment of a genetically and biochemically tractable infection model: the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum combined with the fish pathogen Francisella noatunensis subsp. noatunensis. Phagocytosed F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis interacts with the endosomal pathway and escapes further phagosomal maturation by translocating into the host cell cytosol. F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis lacking IglC, a known virulence determinant required for Francisella intracellular replication, follows the normal phagosomal maturation and does not grow in Dictyostelium. The attenuation of the F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis \u0394iglC mutant was confirmed in a zebrafish embryo model, where growth of F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis \u0394iglC was restricted. In Dictyostelium, F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis interacts with the autophagic machinery. The intracellular bacteria colocalize with autophagic markers, and when autophagy is impaired (Dictyostelium \u0394atg1), F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis accumulates within Dictyostelium cells. Altogether, the Dictyostelium-F. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis infection model recapitulates the course of infection described in other host systems. The genetic and biochemical tractability of the system allows new approaches to elucidate the dynamic interactions between pathogenic Francisella and its host organism.",

        "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a group of inherited, severe neurodegenerative disorders also known as Batten disease. Juvenile NCL (JNCL) is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in CLN3, which encodes a transmembrane protein that regulates endocytic pathway trafficking, though its primary function is not yet known. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is increasingly utilized for neurological disease research and is particularly suited for investigation of protein function in trafficking. Therefore, here we establish new overexpression and knockout Dictyostelium cell lines for JNCL research. Dictyostelium Cln3 fused to GFP localized to the contractile vacuole system and to compartments of the endocytic pathway. cln3- cells displayed increased rates of proliferation and an associated reduction in the extracellular levels and cleavage of the autocrine proliferation repressor, AprA. Mid- and late development of cln3- cells was precocious and cln3- slugs displayed increased migration. Expression of either Dictyostelium Cln3 or human CLN3 in cln3- cells suppressed the precocious development and aberrant slug migration, which were also suppressed by calcium chelation. Taken together, our results show that Cln3 is a pleiotropic protein that negatively regulates proliferation and development in Dictyostelium. This new model system, which allows for the study of Cln3 function in both single cells and a multicellular organism, together with the observation that expression of human CLN3 restores abnormalities in Dictyostelium cln3- cells, strongly supports the use of this new model for JNCL research.",

Although caspase-dependent apoptosis plays a role in caffeine-induced cell death, the responsible intracellular signalling cascade remains incompletely understood. The cellular slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum, does not possess caspase-dependent apoptotic machinery. Here, we observed that ablation of D. discoideumplaA, which encodes a phospholipase A2 (PLA\u2082) homolog, leads to a decreased rate of cell death under high caffeine concentrations and to enhanced cell death with the addition of arachidonic acid. Moreover, the inhibition of PLA\u2082 activity lead to a recovery of the survival rate in caspase-inhibited Hela cervical carcinoma cells under high caffeine concentrations, indicating that caffeine-induced cell death is enhanced via PLA\u2082-dependent signalling. Our results indicate that arachidonic acid may be a general second messenger that negatively regulates caffeine tolerance via a caspase-independent cell death cascade, which leads to multiple effects in eukaryotic cells.",

        "abstract": "During developmental and immune responses, cells move towards or away from some signals. Although much is known about chemoattraction, chemorepulsion (the movement of cells away from a stimulus) remains poorly understood. Proliferating Dictyostelium discoideum cells secrete a chemorepellent protein called AprA. Examining existing knockout strains, we previously identified proteins required for AprA-induced chemorepulsion, and a genetic screen suggested that the enzyme phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase A (PIPkinA, also known as Pik6) might also be needed for chemorepulsion. Here, we show that cells lacking PIPkinA are not repelled by AprA, and that this phenotype is rescued by expression of PIPkinA. To bias cell movement, AprA inhibits Ras activation at the side of the cell closest to the source of AprA, and we find that PIPkinA is required for AprA to inhibit Ras activation. PIPkinA decreases levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3], and possibly because of these effects, potentiates phagocytosis and inhibits cell proliferation. Cells lacking PIPkinA show normal AprA binding, suggesting that PIPkinA regulates chemorepulsion at a step between the AprA receptor and AprA inhibition of Ras activation.",

To understand and influence these movements, we need to be able to identify and quantify the contribution of their different underlying mechanisms. Here, we define a set of six candidate models-formulated as advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations-that incorporate a range of cell movement drivers. We fitted these models to movement assay data from two different cell types: Dictyostelium discoideum and human melanoma. Model comparison using widely applicable information criterion suggested that movement in both of our study systems was driven primarily by a self-generated gradient in the concentration of a depletable chemical in the cells' environment. For melanoma, there was also evidence that overcrowding influenced movement. These applications of model inference to determine the most likely drivers of cell movement indicate that such statistical techniques have potential to support targeted experimental work in increasing our understanding of collective cell movement in a range of systems.",

We find that the double deletion of cortexillin (ctx) I and II alters the actin cytoskeleton and substantially inhibits all molecular responses to extracellular cAMP. Synthesis of cAMP receptor and adenylyl cyclase A (ACA) is inhibited, and activation of ACA, RasC, and RasG, phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 2, activation of TORC2, and stimulation of actin polymerization and myosin assembly are greatly reduced. As a consequence, cell streaming and development are completely blocked. Expression of ACA-yellow fluorescent protein in the ctxI/ctxII-null cells significantly rescues the wild-type phenotype, indicating that the primary chemotaxis and development defect is the inhibition of ACA synthesis and cAMP production. These results demonstrate the critical importance of a properly organized actin cytoskeleton for cAMP-signaling pathways, chemotaxis, and development in Dictyostelium.",

We have used Dictyostelium as a model organism to study the effects of BME. Only two Zn(2+)-binding aminopeptidases have been identified in Dictyostelium to date, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase A and B (PsaA and PsaB). PSA from other organisms is known to regulate cell division and differentiation. Here we show that PsaA is differentially expressed throughout growth and development of Dictyostelium, and its expression is regulated by developmental morphogens. We present evidence that BME specifically interacts with PsaA and inhibits its aminopeptidase activity. Treatment of cells with BME inhibited the rate of cell growth and the frequency of cell division in growing cells and inhibited spore cell differentiation during late development. Overexpression of PsaA-GFP (where GFP is green fluorescent protein) also inhibited spore cell differentiation but did not affect growth. Using chimeras, we have identified that nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of PsaA affects the choice between stalk or spore cell differentiation pathway. Cells that overexpressed PsaA-GFP (primarily nuclear) differentiated into stalk cells, while cells that overexpressed PsaA\u0394NLS2-GFP (cytoplasmic) differentiated into spores. In conclusion, we have identified that BME inhibits cell growth, division, and differentiation in Dictyostelium likely through inhibition of PsaA.",

Eukaryotic cells sense chemoattractant with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and chemotax toward gradients with an enormous concentration range through adaptation. Cells in adaptation no longer respond to the present stimulus but remain sensitive to stronger stimuli. Thus, adaptation provides a fundamental strategy for eukaryotic cells to chemotax through a gradient. Ras activation is the first step in the chemosensing GPCR signaling pathways that displays a transient activation behavior in both model organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and mammalian neutrophils. Recently, it has been revealed that C2GAP1 and CAPRI control the GPCR-mediated adaptation in <i>D. discoideum</i> and human neutrophils, respectively. More importantly, both Ras inhibitors regulate the sensitivity of the cells. These findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism by which eukaryotic cells gate concentration range of chemoattractants for chemotaxis.",

        "abstract": "Initial studies on the inositol phosphates metabolism were enabled by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. The abundant amount of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub> also known as Phytic acid) present in the amoeba allowed the discovery of the more polar inositol pyrophosphates, IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub>, possessing one or two high energy phosphoanhydride bonds, respectively. Considering the contemporary growing interest in inositol pyrophosphates, it is surprising that in recent years D. discoideum, has contributed little to our understanding of their metabolism and function. This work fulfils this lacuna, by analysing the ip6k, ppip5k and ip6k-ppip5K amoeba null strains using PAGE, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and CE-MS analysis. Our study reveals an inositol pyrophosphate metabolism more complex than previously thought. The amoeba Ip6k synthesizes the 4/6-IP<sub>7</sub> in contrast to the 5-IP<sub>7</sub> isomer synthesized by the mammalian homologue. The amoeba Ppip5k synthesizes the same 1/3-IP<sub>7</sub> as the mammalian enzyme. In D. discoideum, the ip6k strain possesses residual amounts of IP<sub>7</sub>. The residual IP<sub>7</sub> is also present in the ip6k-ppip5K strain, while the ppip5k single mutant shows a decrease in both IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> levels. This phenotype is in contrast to the increase in IP<sub>7</sub> observable in the yeast vip1\u0394 strain. The presence of IP<sub>8</sub> in ppip5k and the presence of IP<sub>7</sub> in ip6k-ppip5K indicate the existence of an additional inositol pyrophosphate synthesizing enzyme. Additionally, we investigated the existence of a metabolic relationship between inositol pyrophosphate synthesis and inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) metabolism as observed in yeast. These studies reveal that contrary to the yeast, Ip6k and Ppip5k do not control polyP cellular level in amoeba.",

        "abstract": "Polyphosphate is a polymer of phosphate residues linked by high energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Despite being highly conserved throughout nature, its function is poorly understood. Here we show that Dictyostelium cells accumulate extracellular polyphosphate, and this acts to inhibit proliferation at high cell densities. In shaking culture, extracellular polyphosphate concentrations increase as cell density increases, and if the concentration of polyphosphate observed at the stationary phase is added to cells at mid-log, proliferation is halted. Adding an exopolyphosphatase to cell cultures or stationary phase conditioned medium decreases polyphosphate levels and abrogates the anti-proliferative effect. The cells show saturable binding of polyphosphate, suggesting the presence of a cell surface polyphosphate receptor. Extracellular polyphosphate accumulation is potentiated by decreased nutrient levels, potentially as a means to anticipate starvation. Loss of the Dictyostelium polyphosphate kinase DdPpk1 causes intracellular polyphosphate levels to become undetectable and negatively affects fitness, cytokinesis, and germination. However, cells lacking DdPpk1 accumulate \u223c50% normal levels of extracellular polyphosphate, suggesting an additional means of synthesis. We found that cells lacking inositol hexakisphosphate kinase, which is responsible for the synthesis of the inositol pyrophosphates IP7 and IP8, reach abnormally high cell densities and show decreased extracellular polyphosphate levels. Two different enzymes thus appear to mediate the synthesis of Dictyostelium extracellular polyphosphate, which is used as a signal in an autocrine negative feedback loop to regulate cell proliferation.",

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a model for a wide range of biological processes including chemotaxis, cell-cell communication, phagocytosis, and development. Interrogating these processes with modern genetic tools often requires the expression of multiple transgenes. While it is possible to transfect multiple transcriptional units, the use of separate promoters and terminators for each gene leads to large plasmid sizes and possible interference between units. In many eukaryotic systems this challenge has been addressed through polycistronic expression mediated by 2A viral peptides, permitting efficient, co-regulated gene expression. Here, we screen the most commonly used 2A peptides, porcine teschovirus-1 2A (P2A), Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A), equine rhinitis A virus 2A (E2A), and foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A (F2A), for activity in D. discoideum and find that all the screened 2A sequences are effective. However, combining the coding sequences of two proteins into a single transcript leads to notable strain-dependent decreases in expression level, suggesting additional factors regulate gene expression in D. discoideum that merit further investigation. Our results show that P2A is the optimal sequence for polycistronic expression in D. discoideum, opening up new possibilities for genetic engineering in this model system.",

However, p2xA was found to have an exclusively intracellular localisation making it unclear whether Dictyostelium utilise P2 receptors in a manner analogous to vertebrates. Using an apoaequorin expressing strain we show here that Dictyostelium do possess cell surface P2 receptors that facilitate Ca(2+) influx in response to extracellular ATP and ADP (EC(50)=7.5microM and 6.1microM, respectively). Indicative of P2X receptor activation, responses were rapid reaching peak within 2.91+/-0.04s, required extracellular Ca(2+), were inhibited by Gd(3+), modified by extracellular pH and were not affected by deletion of either the single Gbeta or iplA genes. Responses also remained unaffected by disruption of p2xA or p2xE showing that these genes are not involved. Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) inhibited purine-evoked Ca(2+) influx with IC(50) values of 0.9 and 6.3microM, respectively. 300microM Zn(2+) completely abolished the initial large rapid rise in intracellular Ca(2+) revealing the presence of an additional smaller, slower P2Y-like response. The existence of P2 receptors in Dictyostelium makes this organism a valuable model to explore fundamental aspects of purinergic signalling.",

Most prevalent is the R155C point mutation. We studied the function of p97 in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and have generated strains that ectopically express wild-type (p97) or mutant p97 (p97(R155C)) fused to RFP in AX2 wild-type and autophagy 9 knock-out (ATG9(KO)) cells. Native gel electrophoresis showed that both p97 and p97(R155C) assemble into hexamers. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that endogenous p97 and p97(R155C)-RFP form heteromers. The mutant strains displayed changes in cell growth, phototaxis, development, proteasomal activity, ubiquitinylated proteins, and ATG8(LC3) indicating mis-regulation of multiple essential cellular processes. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis revealed an increase of protein aggregates in ATG9(KO)/p97(R155C)-RFP and ATG9(KO) cells. They were positive for ubiquitin in both strains, however, solely immunoreactive for p97 in the ATG9(KO) mutant. A major finding is that the expression of p97(R155C)-RFP in the ATG9(KO) strain partially or fully rescued the pleiotropic phenotype. We also observed dose-dependent effects of p97 on several cellular processes. Based on findings in the single versus the double mutants we propose a novel mode of p97 interaction with the core autophagy protein ATG9 which is based on mutual inhibition.",

Cells can also migrate using blebs, in which the edge is driven forward by hydrostatic pressure instead of actin. In <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, loss of SCAR is compensated by WASP moving to the leading edge to generate morphologically normal pseudopods. Here we use an inducible double knockout to show that cells lacking both SCAR and WASP are unable to grow, make pseudopods or, unexpectedly, migrate using blebs. Remarkably, amounts and dynamics of actin polymerization are normal. Pseudopods are replaced in double SCAR/WASP mutants by aberrant filopods, induced by the formin dDia2. Further disruption of the gene for dDia2 restores cells' ability to initiate blebs and thus migrate, though pseudopods are still lost. Triple knockout cells still contain near-normal F-actin levels. This work shows that SCAR, WASP, and dDia2 compete for actin. Loss of SCAR and WASP causes excessive dDia2 activity, maintaining F-actin levels but blocking pseudopod and bleb formation and migration.",

Analysis of the genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum indicates a low number of sequences with G4-forming potential (249-1055). Therefore, D. discoideum is a perfect model organism to investigate the relationship between the presence of G4s and their biological functions. As a first step in this investigation, we crystallized the dGGGGGAGGGGTACAGGGGTACAGGGG sequence from the putative promoter region of two divergent genes in D. discoideum. According to the crystal structure, this sequence folds into a four-quartet intramolecular antiparallel G4 with two lateral and one diagonal loops. The G-quadruplex core is further stabilized by a G-C Watson-Crick base pair and a A-T-A triad and displays high thermal stability (Tm > 90\u00b0C at 100 mM KCl). Biophysical characterization of the native sequence and loop mutants suggests that the DNA adopts the same structure in solution and in crystalline form, and that loop interactions are important for the G4 stability but not for its folding. Four-tetrad G4 structures are sparse. Thus, our work advances understanding of the structural diversity of G-quadruplexes and yields coordinates for in silico drug screening programs and G4 predictive tools.",

We report the identification and characterization of a PA28/REG homolog in Dictyostelium. Association of a recombinant Dictyostelium REG with the purified Dictyostelium 20S proteasome led to the preferential stimulation of the trypsin-like proteasome peptidase activity. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that the proteasome activator is localized to the nucleus and is present in growing as well as starving Dictyostelium cells. Our results indicate that the Dictyostelium PA28/REG activator can stimulate both the trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities of the 20S proteasome and supports the idea that the REGgamma-20S proteasome represents an early unique nuclear degradation pathway for eukaryotic cells.",

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a very dominant role in controlling morphogenesis and cell differentiation in the model species Dictyostelium discoideum. As a secreted chemoattractant cAMP coordinates cell movement during aggregation and fruiting body morphogenesis. Secreted cAMP also controls gene expression at different developmental stages, while intracellular cAMP is extensively used to transduce the effect of other stimuli that control the developmental program.

Though all mitochondria probably arose through a single, ancient bacterial endosymbiosis, the mitochondria of only certain protists appear to have retained FtsZ, and the protein is absent from the mitochondria of fungi, animals, and higher plants. We have investigated the role that FtsZ plays in mitochondrial division in the genetically tractable protist Dictyostelium discoideum, which has two nuclearly encoded FtsZs, FszA and FszB, that are targeted to the inside of mitochondria. In most wild-type amoebae, the mitochondria are spherical or rod-shaped, but in fsz-null mutants they become elongated into tubules, indicating that a decrease in mitochondrial division has occurred. In support of this role in organelle division, antibodies to FszA and FszA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) show belts and puncta at multiple places along the mitochondria, which may define future or recent sites of division. FszB-GFP, in contrast, locates to an electron-dense, submitochondrial body usually located at one end of the organelle, but how it functions during division is unclear. This is the first demonstration of two differentially localized FtsZs within the one organelle, and it points to a divergence in the roles of these two proteins.",

In this study, we applied periodic stretching stimuli to neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells, which migrate perpendicular to the direction of stretch. Detailed analysis of the trajectories of HL-60 cells and Dictyostelium cells obtained in a previous study revealed that the higher probability of a switch of migration direction to that perpendicular to the direction of stretching was the main cause of such directional migration.

Here, we show that the mRNAs and proteins of these four chemotaxis pathways and actin are preferentially enriched at the cell front during dynamic cell migration, which requires the Pumilio-related RNA-binding protein Puf118. Significantly, disruption of the Pumilio-binding sequence in chemotaxis pathway mRNAs, or mislocalization of Puf118 and its target mRNAs to the cell rear perturbs efficient chemotaxis in shallow cAMP gradients, without affecting the abundance of the mRNAs or encoded proteins.

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene-regulatory mechanism in eukarya that is based on the presence of double stranded RNA and that can act on both, the transcription or post-transcriptional level. In many species, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) are required for RNAi. To study the function of the three RdRPs in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we have deleted the encoding genes rrpA, rrpB and rrpC in all possible combinations. In these strains, expression of either antisense or hairpin RNA constructs against the transgene lacZ resulted in a 50% reduced \u03b2-Galactosidase activity. Northern blots surprisingly revealed unchanged lacZ mRNA levels, indicative of post-transcriptional regulation. Only in rrpC knock out strains, low levels of \u03b2-gal small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could be detected in antisense RNA expressing strains. In contrast to this, and at considerably higher levels, all hairpin RNA expressing strains featured \u03b2-gal siRNAs. Spreading of the silencing signal to mRNA sequences 5' of the original hairpin trigger was observed in all strains, except when the rrpC gene or that of the dicer-related nuclease DrnB was deleted. Thus, our data indicate that transitivity of an RNA silencing signal exists in D. discoideum and that it requires the two enzymes RrpC and DrnB.",

One mechanism that induces cells to correlate their motions is contact inhibition of locomotion, by which cells migrating away from the contact site. Here, we report that tail-following behavior at the contact site, termed contact following locomotion (CFL), can induce a non-trivial collective behavior in migrating cells. We show the emergence of a traveling band showing polar order in a mutant <i>Dictyostelium</i> cell that lacks chemotactic activity. We find that CFL is the cell-cell interaction underlying this phenomenon, enabling a theoretical description of how this traveling band forms. We further show that the polar order phase consists of subpopulations that exhibit characteristic transversal motions with respect to the direction of band propagation. These findings describe a novel mechanism of collective cell migration involving cell-cell interactions capable of inducing traveling band with polar order.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about how eukaryotic cells can sense their number or spatial density and stop proliferating when the local density reaches a set value. We previously found that Dictyostelium discoideum accumulates extracellular polyphosphate to inhibit its proliferation, and this requires the G protein-coupled receptor GrlD and the small GTPase RasC. Here, we show that cells lacking the G protein component G\u03b2, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor GefA, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phospholipase C (PLC), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-like protein A (IplA), polyphosphate kinase 1 (Ppk1), or the TOR complex 2 component PiaA have significantly reduced sensitivity to polyphosphate-induced proliferation inhibition. Polyphosphate upregulates IP3, and this requires GrlD, GefA, PTEN, PLC, and PiaA. Polyphosphate also upregulates cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and this requires GrlD, G\u03b2, GefA, RasC, PLC, IplA, Ppk1, and PiaA. Together, these data suggest that polyphosphate uses signal transduction pathways including IP3/Ca<sup>2+</sup> to inhibit the proliferation of D. discoideum. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many mammalian tissues such as the liver have the remarkable ability to regulate their size and have their cells stop proliferating when the tissue reaches the correct size. One possible mechanism involves the cells secreting a signal that they all sense, and a high level of the signal tells the cells that there are enough of them and to stop proliferating. Although regulating such mechanisms could be useful to regulate tissue size to control cancer or birth defects, little is known about such systems. Here, we use a microbial system to study such a mechanism, and we find that key elements of the mechanism have similarities to human proteins. This then suggests the possibility that we may eventually be able to regulate the proliferation of selected cell types in humans and animals.",

        "abstract": "Quorum sensing, also known as cell-density sensing in the unicellular eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, is required for efficient entry into the differentiation and development segment of its life cycle. Quorum sensing is accomplished by simultaneously secreting and sensing the glycoprotein Conditioned Medium Factor, or CMF. When the density of starving cells is high, CMF levels are high, which leads to aggregation followed by development. Here, we describe the role of pldB, a gene coding for a putative phospholipase D (PLD) homologue, in quorum sensing. We find that in submerged culture, adding butanol, an inhibitor of PLD-catalyzed phosphatidic acid production, allows cells to bypass the requirement for CMF mediated quorum sensing and aggregate at low cell density. Deletion of pldB mimics the presence of butanol, allowing cells to aggregate at low cell density. pldB- cells also initiate and finish aggregation rapidly. Analysis of early developmental gene expression in pldB- cells reveals that the cyclic AMP receptor cAR1 is expressed at higher levels earlier than in wild-type cells, which could explain the rapid aggregation phenotype. As would be predicted, cells overexpressing pldB are unable to aggregate even at high cell density. Adding CMF to these pldB- overexpressing cells does not rescue aggregation. Both of these phenotypes are cell autonomous, as mixing a small number of pldB- cells with wild-type cells does not cause the wild-type cells to behave like pldB- cells.",

MPAC consists of a flavin-based blue light-sensing LOV domain and a catalytic domain. In this work, we expressed mPAC in an adenylate cyclase A null mutant (aca-) of the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and tested to what extent light activation of mPAC could restore the cAMP-dependent developmental programme of this organism. Amoebas of Dictyostelium, a well-established model organism, generate and respond to cAMP pulses, which cause them to aggregate and construct fruiting bodies. mPAC was expressed under control of a constitutive actin-15 promoter in D. discoideum and displayed low basal adenylyl cyclase activity in darkness that was about five-fold stimulated by blue light. mPAC expression in aca- cells marginally restored aggregation and fruiting body formation in darkness. However, more and larger fruiting bodies were formed when mPAC expressing cells were incubated in light. Extending former applications of light-regulated AC, these results demonstrate that mPAC can be used to manipulate multicellular development in eukaryotes in a light dependent manner.",

The starvation-induced aggregation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum into a multicellular slug is known to result from single-cell chemotaxis towards emitted pulses of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient, short-range chemical gradients lead to coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we developed a multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe behaviors ranging widely from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of long-range cell-cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyzed cell-cell correlations, showing evidence of self-organization at the onset of aggregation (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell collectives, despite their finite size, show features of criticality known from phase transitions in physical systems. By comparing wild-type and mutant cells with impaired aggregation, we found the longest cell-cell communication distance in wild-type cells, suggesting that criticality provides an adaptive advantage and optimally sized aggregates for the dispersal of spores.",

We document an extraordinary amount of within-species protein sequence variation in the model eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum stemming from triplet DNA repeats coding for long strings of single amino acids. D. discoideum has a very large number of such strings, many of which are polyglutamine repeats, the same sequence that causes various human neurological disorders in humans, like Huntington's disease. We show here that D. discoideum coding repeat loci are highly variable among individuals, making D. discoideum a candidate for the most variable proteome. The coding repeat loci are not significantly less variable than similar non-coding triplet repeats. This pattern is consistent with these amino-acid repeats being largely non-functional sequences evolving primarily by mutation and drift.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum has protein kinases AKT/PKBA and PKBR1 that belong to the AGC family of kinases. The protein kinase B-related kinase (PKBR1) has been studied with emphasis on its role in chemotaxis, but its roles in late development remained obscure. The pkbR1 null mutant stays in the first finger stage for about 16 h or longer. Only a few aggregates continue to the migrating slug stage; however, the slugs immediately go back probably to the previous first finger stage and stay there for approximately 37 h. Finally, the mutant fingers diversify into various multicellular bodies. The expression of the pkbR1 finger protein probably is required for development to the slug stage and to express ecmB, which is first observed in migrating slugs. The mutant also showed no ST-lacZ expression, which is of the earliest step in differentiation to one of the stalk cell subtypes. The pkbR1 null mutant forms a small number of aberrant fruiting bodies, but in the presence of 10% of wild-type amoebae the mutant preferentially forms viable spores, driving the wild type to form nonviable stalk cells. These results suggest that the mutant has defects in a system that changes the physiological dynamics in the prestalk cell region of a finger. We suggest that the arrest of its development is due to the loss of the second wave of expression of a protein kinase A catalytic subunit gene (pkaC) only in the prestalk region of the pkbR1 null mutant.",

In an earlier study, we identified six copine genes in the Dictyostelium discoideum genome and focused our studies on cpnA. Our previous localization studies of green fluorescent protein-tagged CpnA in Dictyostelium suggested that CpnA may have roles in contractile vacuole function, endolysosomal trafficking, and development. To test these hypotheses, we created a cpnA- knockout strain, and here we report the initial characterization of the mutant phenotype. The cpnA- cells exhibited normal growth rates and a slight cytokinesis defect. When placed in starvation conditions, cpnA- cells appeared to aggregate into mounds and form fingers with normal timing; however, they were delayed or arrested in the finger stage. When placed in water, cpnA- cells formed unusually large contractile vacuoles, indicating a defect in contractile vacuole function, while endocytosis and phagocytosis rates for the cpnA- cells were similar to those seen for wild-type cells. These studies indicate that CpnA plays a role in cytokinesis and contractile vacuole function and is required for normal development, specifically in the later stages prior to culmination. We also used real-time reverse transcription-PCR to determine the expression patterns of all six copine genes during development. The six copine genes were expressed in vegetative cells, with each gene exhibiting a distinct pattern of expression throughout development. All of the copine genes except cpnF showed an upregulation of mRNA expression at one or two developmental transitions, suggesting that copines may be important regulators of Dictyostelium development.",

Five genes whose expression is dependent on SrfA have been isolated by differential hybridization. One of these genes, sigC, is identical to phg1b, previously characterized in mutants with altered adhesive properties and found to encode a nine-transmembrane-domain protein. This gene is transcribed into two mRNAs as the result of alternative splicing of two internal exons. The slower-migrating mRNA codes for a shorter protein that lacks the first transmembrane fragment and is not expressed in srfA null strains. The other four genes (sigA, sigB, sigD, and 45D) are expressed only during late developmental stages. In situ hybridization experiments showed that expression of sigA, sigB, and sigD is restricted to the sorus of developing structures. sigA codes for a homologue of malate dehydrogenase that converts pyruvate to malate to replenish the tricarboxylic acid cycle. sigB encodes a protein with significant similarity to the GP63 metalloproteinase of Leishmania, leishmanolysin. The sequence of SigD is highly similar to that of several spore coat proteins of D. discoideum, and it may play a role in that structure. The gene 45D codes for an RNA-binding protein homologue whose expression is also dependent on the GATA transcription factor stalky (StkA). The expression of sigB is also dependent on both SrfA and StkA. The expression of 45D, but not of sigA, sigB, sigC, and sigD, can be induced in srfA null cells by constitutive protein kinase A activation. Strains in which either sigA, sigB, or sigD is disrupted were isolated and found to form spores that are not detectably different from those of wild-type strains.",

Although both lectins bind galactose (Gal) and GalNAc, glycan array experiments performed on the recombinant proteins displayed strong differences in their specificity for oligosaccharides. DiscI and DiscII bind preferentially to Gal/GalNAcbeta1-3Gal/GalNAc-containing and Gal/GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-6Gal/GalNAc-containing glycans, respectively. The affinity of the interaction of DiscI with monosaccharides and disaccharides was evaluated using isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. The three-dimensional structures of native DiscI and its complexes with GalNAc, GalNAcbeta1-3Gal, and Galbeta1-3GalNAc were solved by X-ray crystallography. DiscI forms trimers with involvement of calcium at the monomer interface. The N-terminal discoidin domain presents a structural similarity to F-type lectins such as the eel agglutinin, where an amphiphilic binding pocket suggests possible carbohydrate-binding activity. In the C-terminal H-type lectin domain, the GalNAc residue establishes specific hydrogen bonds that explain the observed affinity (K(d)=3x10(-4) M). The different specificities of DiscI and DiscII for oligosaccharides were rationalized from the different structures obtained by either X-ray crystallography or molecular modeling.",

Relying on single-particle tracking data of 320,000 data points, we performed a systematic analysis of four possible origins for non-Gaussian transport: 1) sample-based variability, 2) rarely occurring strong motion events, 3) ergodicity breaking/aging, and 4) spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the intracellular medium. After excluding the first three reasons, we investigated the remaining hypothesis of a heterogeneous cytoplasm as cause for non-Gaussian transport. A, to our knowledge, novel fit model with randomly distributed diffusivities implementing medium heterogeneities suits the experimental data. Strikingly, the non-Gaussian feature is independent of the cytoskeleton condition and lag time. This reveals that\u00a0efficiency and consistency of passive intracellular transport and the related anomalous scaling of the mean-squared displacement are regulated by cytoskeleton components, whereas cytoplasmic heterogeneities are responsible for the generic, non-Gaussian distribution of increments.",

        "abstract": "Glycoprotein gp130, found on the plasma membrane of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, was postulated previously to play a role in phagocytosis. The gene for gp130 was cloned and when translated, yielded a 768 amino acid preproprotein of 85.3 kDa. It had nearly 40% similarity to the 138 kDa family of glycoproteins implicated in sexual cell fusion during macrocyst formation in D. discoideum. The difference between the calculated size and observed M(r) of 130 kDa on protein gels likely was due to N-glycosylation that was confirmed by lectin blots. Consistent with its surface-exposure, an antibody raised against recombinant protein stained the plasma membrane of D. discoideum amoebae. Gp130 and its transcripts were high during axenic growth of cells, but relatively low during growth on bacteria. The gene for gp130 was disrupted and cell lines lacking the glycoprotein were efficient phagocytes, indicating that gp130 was dispensable for phagocytosis. Gp130-null cells were similar in size to parent DH1 cells, had enhanced macropinocytosis and grew faster to higher densities. They also exhibited weaker cell-substrate adhesion but displayed greater cell-cell cohesion. Collectively, the data indicated that gp130 influenced macropinocytosis and played a role in adhesion during vegetative growth.",

Whereas little is known of encystation, sporulation requires both extra- and intracellular cAMP. After aggregation of social amoebae, extracellular cAMP binding to surface receptors and intracellular cAMP binding to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) act together to induce prespore differentiation. Later, a second episode of PKA activation triggers spore maturation. Adenylyl cyclase B (ACB) produces cAMP for maturation, but the cAMP source for prespore induction is unknown. We show that adenylyl cyclase G (ACG) protein is upregulated in prespore tissue after aggregation. acg null mutants show reduced prespore differentiation, which becomes very severe when ACB is also deleted. ACB is normally expressed in prestalk cells, but is upregulated in the prespore region of acg null structures. These data show that ACG induces prespore differentiation in wild-type cells, with ACB capable of partially taking over this function in its absence.",

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> is a soil-dwelling unicellular eukaryote that accumulates extracellular polyphosphate (polyP). At high cell densities, when the cells are about to overgrow their food supply and starve, the corresponding high extracellular concentrations of polyP allow the cells to preemptively anticipate starvation, inhibit proliferation, and prime themselves to begin development. In this report, we show that starved <i>D. discoideum</i> cells accumulate cell surface and extracellular polyP. Starvation reduces macropinocytosis, exocytosis, and phagocytosis, and we find that these effects require the G protein-coupled polyP receptor (GrlD) and two enzymes, Polyphosphate kinase 1 (Ppk1), which is required for synthesizing intracellular polyP, cell surface polyP, and some of the extracellular polyP, and Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase (I6kA), which is required for cell surface polyP and polyP binding to cells, and some of the extracellular polyP. PolyP reduces membrane fluidity, and we find that starvation reduces membrane fluidity; this effect requires GrlD and Ppk1, but not I6kA. Together, these data suggest that in starved cells, extracellular polyP decreases membrane fluidity, possibly as a protective measure. In the starved cells, sensing polyP appears to decrease energy expenditure from ingestion, and decrease exocytosis, and to both decrease energy expenditures and retain nutrients.",

Of the mechanisms that we simulated, prestalk cells being more directed is the best strategy followed by increased asymmetric motive forces for prestalk cells. The lifetime of the cell adhesion molecules, while not enough to produce differential motion, did modulate the results of the strategies employed.

Here, we show that this three-step modification pathway exists in Dictyostelium discoideum, model of the evolutionary superfamily Amoebozoa. Not only are previously established modifications observable by mass spectrometry in strains with the most conserved genes of each step deleted, but also additional modifications are detected, indicating a certain plasticity of the pathway in the amoeba. Unlike described for yeast, D. discoideum allows for an unconditional deletion of the single tQCUG gene, as long as the Elongator-dependent modification pathway is intact. In gene deletion strains of the modification pathway, protein amounts are significantly reduced as shown by flow cytometry and Western blotting, using strains expressing different glutamine leader constructs fused to GFP. Most dramatic are these effects, when the tQCUG gene is deleted, or Elp3, the catalytic component of the Elongator complex is missing. In addition, Elp3 is the most strongly conserved protein of the modification pathway, as our phylogenetic analysis reveals. The implications of this observation are discussed with respect to the evolutionary age of the components acting in the Elongator-dependent modification pathway.",

A simulation analysis based on an agent-based model reproduces the movement of ATP-rich cells observed in the experiments.

        "abstract": "Macroautophagy, a highly conserved and complex intracellular degradative pathway, involves more than 20 core autophagy (ATG) proteins, among them the hexameric ATG12~5/16 complex, which is part of the essential ubiquitin-like conjugation systems in autophagy. <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i><i>atg5</i> single, <i>atg5</i><i>/</i><i>12</i> double, and <i>atg5</i><i>/</i><i>12</i><i>/</i><i>16</i> triple gene knock-out mutant strains displayed similar defects in the conjugation of ATG8 to phosphatidylethanolamine, development, and cell viability upon nitrogen starvation. This implies that ATG5, 12 and 16 act as a functional unit in canonical autophagy. Macropinocytosis of TRITC dextran and phagocytosis of yeast were significantly decreased in ATG5\u00af and ATG5\u00af/12\u00af and even further in ATG5\u00af/12\u00af/16\u00af cells. In contrast, plaque growth on <i>Klebsiella aerogenes</i> was about twice as fast for ATG5\u00af and ATG5\u00af/12\u00af/16\u00af cells in comparison to AX2, but strongly decreased for ATG5\u00af/12\u00af cells. Along this line, phagocytic uptake of <i>Escherichia coli</i> was significantly reduced in ATG5\u00af/12\u00af cells, while no difference in uptake, but a strong increase in membrane association of <i>E. coli</i><i>,</i> was seen for ATG5\u00af and ATG5\u00af/12\u00af/16\u00af cells. Proteasomal activity was also disturbed in a complex fashion, consistent with an inhibitory activity of ATG16 in the absence of ATG5 and/or ATG12. Our results confirm the essential function of the ATG12~5/16 complex in canonical autophagy, and furthermore are consistent with autophagy-independent functions of the complex and its individual components. They also strongly support the placement of autophagy upstream of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), as a fully functional UPS depends on autophagy.",

They replicate by producing DNA copies of their own RNA, which are integrated at new locations in the host cell genome. In the gene-dense genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, retrotransposon TRE5-A avoids insertional mutagenesis by targeting the transcription factor (TF) IIIC/IIIB complex and integrating \u223c 50 bp upstream of tRNA genes. We generated synthetic TRE5-A retrotransposons (TRE5-A(bsr)) that were tagged with a selection marker that conferred resistance to blasticidin after a complete retrotransposition cycle. We found that the TRE5-A(bsr) elements were efficiently mobilized in trans by proteins expressed from the endogenous TRE5-A population found in D. discoideum cells. ORF1 protein translated from TRE5-A(bsr) elements significantly enhanced retrotransposition. We observed that the 5' untranslated region of TRE5-A could be replaced by an unrelated promoter, whereas the 3' untranslated region of TRE5-A was essential for retrotransposition. A predicted secondary structure in the RNA of the 3' untranslated region of TRE5-A may be involved in the retrotransposition process.

We identified three HP1-like genes (hcpA, hcpB, and hcpC) in the Dictyostelium discoideum genome. Two of these (hcpA and hcpB) are expressed, and the proteins colocalized as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in one major cluster at the nuclear periphery that was also characterized by histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation, a histone modification so far not described for Dictyostelium. The data strongly suggest that this cluster represents the centromeres. Both single-knockout strains displayed only subtle phenotypes, suggesting that both isoforms have largely overlapping functions. In contrast, disruption of both isoforms appeared to be lethal. Furthermore, overexpression of a C-terminally truncated form of HcpA resulted in phenotypically distinct growth defects that were characterized by a strong decrease in cell viability. Although genetic evidence implies functional redundancy, overexpression of GFP-HcpA, but not GFP-HcpB, caused growth defects that were accompanied by an increase in the frequency of atypic anaphase bridges. Our data indicate that Dictyostelium discoideum cells are sensitive to changes in HcpA and HcpB protein levels and that the two isoforms display different in vivo and in vitro affinities for each other. Since the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery is frequently involved in chromatin remodeling, we analyzed if knockouts of RNAi components influenced the localization of H3K9 dimethylation and HP1 isoforms in Dictyostelium.

To test the contribution of G alpha subunit functional specificity, the chimeric G alpha subunits, G alpha2/4 and G alpha5/4, were created and analyzed along with wild-type subunits for the ability to substitute for the G alpha4 subunit in mediating responses from folate receptors. The G alpha2/4 subunit, but not the G alpha2 or G alpha5/4 subunits, partly rescued chemotaxis and cGMP accumulation in folate-stimulated g alpha4(-) cells. Expression of the G alpha5/4 or G alpha5 subunits resulted in an inhibition of g alpha4- and wild-type cell movement and a reduced aggregate size in developing wild-type and g alpha5- cells suggesting these subunits mediate similar responses. Only the G alpha4 subunit was capable of correcting developmental morphology in g alpha4- multicellular aggregates suggesting that the chimeric G alpha2/4 or G alpha5/4 subunits were insufficient to provide the G alpha4 function necessary for proper development. These results indicate that Dictyostelium G alpha subunit specificity is not limited to receptor coupling and that G alpha subunit sequences outside of the carboxyl terminus are important for cell movement and developmental processes.",

Here, we explore the possibility of a diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) playing a role in regulating the effect of VPA relating to the treatment of both disorders, using the biomedical model <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> DGK enzymes provide the first step in the phosphoinositide recycling pathway, implicated in seizure activity. They also regulate levels of diacylglycerol (DAG), thereby regulating the protein kinase C (PKC) activity that is linked to bipolar disorder-related signalling. Here, we show that ablation of the single <i>Dictyostelium dgkA</i> gene results in reduced sensitivity to the acute effects of VPA on cell behaviour. Loss of <i>dgkA</i> also provides reduced sensitivity to VPA in extended exposure during development. To differentiate a potential role for this DGKA-dependent mechanism in epilepsy and bipolar disorder treatment, we further show that the <i>dgkA</i> null mutant is resistant to the developmental effects of a range of structurally distinct branched medium-chain fatty acids with seizure control activity and to the bipolar disorder treatment lithium. Finally, we show that VPA, lithium and novel epilepsy treatments function through DAG regulation, and the presence of DGKA is necessary for compound-specific increases in DAG levels following treatment. Thus, these experiments suggest that, in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, loss of DGKA attenuates a common cellular effect of VPA relating to both epilepsy and bipolar disorder treatments, and that a range of new compounds with this effect should be investigated as alternative therapeutic agents.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

        "abstract": "Under normal conditions, the Arp2/3 complex activator SCAR/WAVE controls actin polymerization in pseudopods, whereas Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) assembles actin at clathrin-coated pits. We show that, unexpectedly, Dictyostelium discoideum SCAR knockouts could still spread, migrate, and chemotax using pseudopods driven by the Arp2/3 complex. In the absence of SCAR, some WASP relocated from the coated pits to the leading edge, where it behaved with similar dynamics to normal SCAR, forming split pseudopods and traveling waves. Pseudopods colocalized with active Rac, whether driven by WASP or SCAR, though Rac was activated to a higher level in SCAR mutants. Members of the SCAR regulatory complex, in particular PIR121, were not required for WASP regulation. We thus show that WASP is able to respond to all core upstream signals and that regulators coupled through the other members of SCAR's regulatory complex are not essential for pseudopod formation. We conclude that WASP and SCAR can regulate pseudopod actin using similar mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "During embryonic development, cell movement is orchestrated by a multitude of attractants and repellents. Chemoattractants applied as a gradient, such as cAMP with Dictyostelium discoideum or fMLP with neutrophils, induce the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase at the front of the cell, leading to the localized depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P(2)) and the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI[3,4,5]P(3)). Using D. discoideum, we show that chemorepellent cAMP analogues induce localized inhibition of PLC, thereby reversing the polarity of PI(4,5)P(2). This leads to the accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P(3) at the rear of the cell, and chemotaxis occurs away from the source. We conclude that a PLC polarity switch controls the response to attractants and repellents.",

        "abstract": "Arfs and Arf GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs) are regulators of membrane trafficking and actin dynamics in mammalian cells. In this study, we identified a primordial Arf, ArfA, and two ArfGAPs (ACAP-A/B) containing BAR, PH, ArfGAP and Ankyrin repeat domains in the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum. In vitro, ArfA has similar nucleotide binding properties as mammalian Arfs and, with GTP bound, is a substrate for ACAP-A and B. We also investigated the physiological functions of ACAP-A/B by characterizing cells lacking both ACAP-A and B. Although ACAP-A/B knockout cells showed no defects in cell growth, migration or chemotaxis, they exhibited abnormal actin protrusions and approximately 50% reduction in spore yield. We conclude that while ACAP-A/B have a conserved biochemical mechanism and effect on actin organization, their role in migration is not conserved. The absence of an effect on Dictyostelium migration may be due to a specific requirement for ACAPs in mesenchymal migration, which is observed in epithelial cancer cells where most studies of mammalian ArfGAPs were performed.",

        "abstract": "The Dictyostelium Intermediate Repeat Sequence 1 (DIRS-1) is the name-giving member of the DIRS order of tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons. In Dictyostelium discoideum, DIRS-1 is highly amplified and enriched in heterochromatic centromers of the D. discoideum genome. We show here that DIRS-1 it tightly controlled by the D. discoideum RNA interference machinery and is only mobilized in mutants lacking either the RNA dependent RNA polymerase RrpC or the Argonaute protein AgnA. DIRS retrotransposons contain an internal complementary region (ICR) that is thought to be required to reconstitute a full-length element from incomplete RNA transcripts. Using different versions of D. discoideum DIRS-1 equipped with retrotransposition marker genes, we show experimentally that the ICR is in fact essential to complete retrotransposition. We further show that DIRS-1 produces a mixture of single-stranded, mostly linear extrachromosomal cDNA intermediates. If this cDNA is isolated and transformed into D. discoideum cells, it can be used by DIRS-1 proteins to complete productive retrotransposition. This work provides the first experimental evidence to propose a general retrotransposition mechanism of the class of DIRS like tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons.",

Here we describe the genome of the best-studied member of this group, Dictyostelium discoideum. The gene-dense chromosomes of this organism encode approximately 12,500 predicted proteins, a high proportion of which have long, repetitive amino acid tracts. There are many genes for polyketide synthases and ABC transporters, suggesting an extensive secondary metabolism for producing and exporting small molecules. The genome is rich in complex repeats, one class of which is clustered and may serve as centromeres. Partial copies of the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) element are found at the ends of each chromosome, suggesting a novel telomere structure and the use of a common mechanism to maintain both the rDNA and chromosomal termini. A proteome-based phylogeny shows that the amoebozoa diverged from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant-animal split, but Dictyostelium seems to have retained more of the diversity of the ancestral genome than have plants, animals or fungi.",

Here we show that positively charged residues located in the c\u03b12 helix of the C2 domain are necessary for the membrane localization of PTEN via stable electrostatic interactions in Dictyostelium discoideum. Single-molecule imaging analyses revealed that PTEN molecules moved distances much larger than expected had they been caused by lateral diffusion, a phenomenon we call \"hopping.\" Our novel single-particle tracking analysis method found that the c\u03b12 helix aids in regulating the hopping and stable-binding states. The dynamically established membrane localization of PTEN was revealed to be essential for developmental processes and clarified a fundamental regulation mechanism of the protein quantity and activity on the plasma membrane.",

Diffusion properties specific for individual protein species have been extensively studied, but the common features among protein species are poorly understood. Here, we systematically studied the lateral diffusion of various transmembrane proteins in the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum cells using a hidden Markov model for single-molecule trajectories obtained experimentally. As common features, all membrane proteins that had from one to ten transmembrane regions adopted three free diffusion states with similar diffusion coefficients regardless of their structural variability. All protein species reduced their mobility similarly upon the inhibition of microtubule or actin cytoskeleton dynamics, or myosin II. The relationship between protein size and the diffusion coefficient was consistent with the Saffman-Delbr\u00fcck model, meaning that membrane viscosity is a major determinant of lateral diffusion, but protein size is not. These protein species-independent properties of multistate free diffusion were explained simply and quantitatively by free diffusion on the three membrane regions with different viscosities, which is in sharp contrast to the complex diffusion behavior of transmembrane proteins in higher eukaryotes.",

To direct cell aggregation, the social amoebae <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> collectively give rise to oscillations and waves of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) under a wide range of cell density. To date, the systems-level mechanism underlying the robustness is unclear. By using quantitative live-cell imaging, here we show that the magnitude of the cAMP relay response of individual cells is determined by fold change in the extracellular cAMP concentrations. The range of cell density and exogenous cAMP concentrations that support oscillations at the population level agrees well with conditions that support a large fold-change-dependent response at the single-cell level. Mathematical analysis suggests that invariance of the oscillations to density transformation is a natural outcome of combining secrete-and-sense systems with a fold-change detection mechanism.",

Studies using Dictyostelium have pioneered a good deal of our understanding of eukaryotic cell communication. In this review, we will present a brief overview of how Dictyostelium cells use extracellular signals to attract each other, repel each other, sense their local cell density, sense whether the nearby cells are starving or stressed, count themselves to organize the formation of structures containing a regulated number of cells, sense the volume they are in, and organize their multicellular development. Although we are probably just beginning to learn what the cells are telling each other, the elucidation of Dictyostelium extracellular signals has already led to the development of possible therapeutics for human diseases.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of the chemotherapy drug cisplatin is often limited due to resistance of the tumors to the drug, and increasing the potency of cisplatin without increasing its concentration could prove beneficial. A previously characterized Dictyostelium discoideum mutant with increased resistance to cisplatin was defective in the gene encoding sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) lyase, which catalyzes the breakdown of S-1-P, an important regulatory molecule in cell function and development and in the regulation of cell fate. We hypothesized that the increased resistance to cisplatin was due to an elevation of S-1-P and predicted that lowering levels of S-1-P should increase sensitivity to the drug. We generated three strains that stably overexpress different levels of the S-1-P lyase. The overexpressor strains have reduced growth rate and, confirming the hypothesis, showed an expression-dependent increase in sensitivity to cisplatin. Consistently, treating the cells with D-erythro-N,N,-dimethylsphingosine, a known inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, increased the sensitivity of mutant and parent cells to cisplatin, while addition of exogenous S-1-P or 8-Br-cyclic AMP made the cells more resistant to cisplatin. The increased sensitivity of the overexpressors to cisplatin was also observed with the cisplatin analog carboplatin. In contrast, the response to doxorubicin, 5-flurouracil, or etoposide was unaffected, indicating that the involvement of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in modulating the response to cisplatin is not part of a global genotoxic stress response. The augmented sensitivity to cisplatin appears to be the result of an intracellular signaling function of S-1-P, because D. discoideum does not appear to have endothelial differentiation growth (EDG/S1P) receptors. Overall, the results show that modulation of the sphingolipid pathway at multiple points can result in increased sensitivity to cisplatin and has the potential for increasing the clinical usefulness of this important drug.",

        "abstract": "An interesting but largely unanswered biological question is how eukaryotic organisms regulate the size of multicellular tissues. During development, a lawn of Dictyostelium cells breaks up into territories, and within the territories the cells aggregate in dendritic streams to form groups of approximately 20,000 cells. Using random insertional mutagenesis to search for genes involved in group size regulation, we found that an insertion in the cnrN gene affects group size. Cells lacking CnrN (cnrN(-)) form abnormally small groups, which can be rescued by the expression of exogenous CnrN. Relayed pulses of extracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) direct cells to aggregate by chemotaxis to form aggregation territories and streams. cnrN(-) cells overaccumulate cAMP during development and form small territories. Decreasing the cAMP pulse size by treating cnrN(-) cells with cAMP phosphodiesterase or starving cnrN(-) cells at a low density rescues the small-territory phenotype. The predicted CnrN sequence has similarity to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which in Dictyostelium inhibits cAMP-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. CnrN inhibits cAMP-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation, Akt activation, actin polymerization, and cAMP production. Our results suggest that CnrN is a protein with some similarities to PTEN and that it regulates cAMP signal transduction to regulate territory size.",

When placed below a millimetric film of liquid nutritive medium, a quasi two-dimensional, high-density population of Dictyostelium discoideum cells spontaneously assembles into compact domains. Their typical size of 100\u2009\u03bcm is governed by a balance between competing interactions: an adhesion acting as a short-range attraction and promoting aggregation, and an effective long-range repulsion stemming from aerotaxis in near anoxic condition. Experimental data, a simple model and cell-based simulations all support this scenario.

We investigated the effects of the exposure to nickel, the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos at effect concentrations (EC) of 25% and 50% and their binary mixture (Ec25 + EC25) on Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae based on lysosomal membrane stability (LMS). We treated D. discoideum with these compounds under controlled laboratory conditions and evaluated the changes in protein levels using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) proteomic approach. Nickel treatment at EC25 induced changes in 14 protein spots, 12 of which were down-regulated. Treatment with nickel at EC50 resulted in changes in 15 spots, 10 of which were down-regulated. Treatment with chlorpyrifos at EC25 induced changes in six spots, all of which were down-regulated; treatment with chlorpyrifos at EC50 induced changes in 13 spots, five of which were down-regulated. The mixture corresponding to EC25 of each compound induced changes in 19 spots, 13 of which were down-regulated. The data together reveal that a different protein expression signature exists for each treatment, and that only a few proteins are modulated in multiple different treatments. For a simple binary mixture, the proteomic response does not allow for the identification of each toxicant. The protein spots that showed significant differences were identified by mass spectrometry, which revealed modulations of proteins involved in metal detoxification, stress adaptation, the oxidative stress response and other cellular processes.",

        "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been the focus of many studies over the past several decades, but the understanding of one subgroup of MAPKs, orthologs of MAPK15, known as atypical MAPKs, has lagged behind others. In most organisms, specific activating signals or downstream responses of atypical MAPK signaling pathways have not yet been identified even though these MAPKs are associated with many eukaryotic processes, including cancer and embryonic development. In this Review, we discuss recent studies that are shedding new light on both the regulation and function of atypical MAPKs in different organisms. In particular, the analysis of the atypical MAPK in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has revealed important roles in chemotactic responses and gene regulation. The rapid and transient phosphorylation of the atypical MAPK in these responses suggest a highly regulated activation mechanism in vivo despite the ability of atypical MAPKs to autophosphorylate in vitro. Atypical MAPK function can also impact the activation of other MAPKs in amoeba. These advances are providing new perspectives on possible MAPK roles in animals that have not been previously considered, and this might lead to the identification of potential targets for regulating cell movement in the treatment of diseases.",

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum integrates into a multicellular organism when individual starving cells aggregate and form a mound. The cells then integrate into defined tissues and develop into a fruiting body that consists of a stalk and spores. Aggregation is initially orchestrated by waves of extracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and previous theory suggested that cAMP and other field-wide diffusible signals mediate tissue integration and terminal differentiation as well. Cooperation between cells depends on an allorecognition system comprising the polymorphic adhesion proteins TgrB1 and TgrC1. Binding between compatible TgrB1 and TgrC1 variants ensures that non-matching cells segregate into distinct aggregates prior to terminal development. Here, we have embedded a small number of cells with incompatible allotypes within fields of developing cells with compatible allotypes. We found that compatibility of the allotype encoded by the tgrB1 and tgrC1 genes is required for tissue integration, as manifested in cell polarization, coordinated movement and differentiation into prestalk and prespore cells. Our results show that the molecules that mediate allorecognition in D. discoideum also control the integration of individual cells into a unified developing organism, and this acts as a gating step for multicellularity.",

CbfA-deficient cells have lost TRE5-A retrotransposition, are impaired in the ability to feed on bacteria, and do not enter multicellular development because of a block in cell aggregation. In this study, we performed Illumina RNA-seq of growing CbfA mutant cells to obtain a list of CbfA-regulated genes. We demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA alone is sufficient to mediate most CbfA-dependent gene expression. The carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA from the distantly related social amoeba Polysphondylium pallidum restored the expression of CbfA-dependent genes in the D. discoideum CbfA mutant, indicating a deep conservation in the gene regulatory function of this domain in the dictyostelid clade. The CbfA-like protein CbfB displays \u223c25% sequence identity with CbfA in the amino-terminal region, which contains a JmjC domain and two zinc finger regions and is thought to mediate chromatin-remodeling activity. In contrast to CbfA proteins, where the carboxy-terminal domains are strictly conserved in all dictyostelids, CbfB proteins have completely unrelated carboxy-terminal domains. Outside the dictyostelid clade, CbfA-like proteins with the CbfA-archetypical JmjC/zinc finger arrangement and individual carboxy-terminal domains are prominent in filamentous fungi but are not found in yeasts, plants, and metazoans. Our data suggest that two functional regions of the CbfA-like proteins evolved at different rates to allow the occurrence of species-specific adaptation processes during genome evolution.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular transport is a complex interplay of ballistic transport along filaments and of diffusive motion, reliably delivering material and allowing for cell differentiation, migration, and proliferation. The diffusive regime, including subdiffusive, Brownian, and superdiffusive motion, is of particular interest for inferring information about the dynamics of the cytoskeleton morphology during intracellular transport. The influence of dynamic cytoskeletal states on intracellular transport are investigated in Dictyostelium discoideum cells by single particle tracking of fluorescent nanoparticles, to relate quantitative motion parameters and intracellular processes before and after cytoskeletal disruption. A local mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis separates ballistic motion phases, which we exclude here, from diffusive nanoparticle motion. In this study, we focus on intracellular subdiffusion and elucidate lag-time dependence, with particular focus on the impact of cytoskeleton compartments like microtubules and actin filaments. This method proves useful for binary motion state distributions. Experimental results are compared to simulations of a data-driven Langevin model with finite velocity correlations that captures essential statistical features of the local MSD algorithm. Specifically, the values of the mean MSD exponent and effective diffusion coefficients can be traced back to negative correlations of the motion's increments. We clearly identify both microtubules and actin filaments as the cause for intracellular subdiffusion and show that actin-microtubule cross talk exerts viscosifying effects at timescales larger than 0.2 s. Our findings might give insights into material transport and information exchange in living cells, which might facilitate gaining control over cell functions.",

        "abstract": "Previous work from our laboratory showed that the Dictyostelium discoideum SadA protein plays a central role in cell-substrate adhesion. SadA null cells exhibit a loss of adhesion, a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, and a cytokinesis defect. How SadA mediates these phenotypes is unknown. This work addresses the mechanism of SadA function, demonstrating an important role for the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail in SadA function. We found that a SadA tailless mutant was unable to rescue the sadA adhesion deficiency, and overexpression of the SadA tail domain reduced adhesion in wild-type cells. We also show that SadA is closely associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Mutagenesis studies suggested that four serine residues in the tail, S924/S925 and S940/S941, may regulate association of SadA with the actin cytoskeleton. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays identified at least one likely interaction partner of the SadA tail, cortexillin I, a known actin bundling protein. Thus, our data demonstrate an important role for the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail in SadA function and strongly suggest that a phosphorylation event in this tail regulates an interaction with cortexillin I. Based on our data, we propose a model for the function of SadA.",

Using a highly sensitive cAMP-FRET reporter, we have now been able to measure periodically propagating cAMP waves directly in these multicellular structures. In slugs cAMP waves are periodically initiated in the tip and propagate backward through the prespore zone. Altered cAMP signalling dynamics in mutants with developmental defects strongly support a key functional role for cAMP waves in multicellular Dictyostelium morphogenesis. These findings thus show that propagating cAMP not only control the initial aggregation process but continue to be the long range cell-cell communication mechanism guiding cell movement during multicellular <i>Dictyostelium</i> morphogenesis at the mound and slugs stages.",

Although retrotransposons encode essential proteins to mediate their amplification, they also require assistance by host cell-encoded machineries that perform functions such as DNA transcription and repair. The retrotransposon TRE5-A of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum generates a notable amount of both sense and antisense RNAs, which are generated from element-internal promoters, located in the A module and the C module, respectively. We observed that TRE5-A retrotransposons depend on the C-module-binding factor (CbfA) to maintain high steady-state levels of TRE5-A transcripts and that CbfA supports the retrotransposition activity of TRE5-A elements. The carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA was found to be required and sufficient to mediate the accumulation of TRE5-A transcripts, but it did not support productive retrotransposition of TRE5-A. This result suggests different roles for CbfA protein domains in the regulation of TRE5-A retrotransposition frequency in D. discoideum cells. Although CbfA binds to the C module in vitro, the factor regulates neither C-module nor A-module promoter activity in vivo. We speculate that CbfA supports the amplification of TRE5-A retrotransposons by suppressing the expression of an as yet unidentified component of the cellular posttranscriptional gene silencing machinery.",

Inactivation of dupA resulted in depressed L. pneumophila growth and sustained hyperphosphorylation of the amoebal MAP kinase ERK1, consistent with loss of a phosphatase activity. Bacterial challenge of wild-type amoebae induced dupA expression and resulted in transiently increased ERK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that dupA and ERK1 are part of a response to bacteria. Indeed, over 500 of the genes misregulated in the dupA(-) mutant were regulated in response to L. pneumophila infection, including some thought to have immune-like functions. MAP kinase phosphatases are known to be highly upregulated in macrophages challenged with L. pneumophila.

Dictyostelium cells have to judge when sufficient cell density has been reached to warrant transition from growth to differentiation. They have to recognize when exogenous nutrients become limiting, and then synchronously initiate development. A few hours later they signal each other with pulses of cAMP that regulate gene expression as well as direct chemotactic aggregation. They then have to recognize kinship and only continue developing when they are surrounded by close kin. Thereafter, the cells diverge into two specialized cell types, prespore and prestalk cells, that continue to signal each other in complex ways to form well proportioned fruiting bodies. In this way they can proceed through the stages of a dependent sequence in an orderly manner without cells being left out or directed down the wrong path.",

        "abstract": "Electrotaxis, the directional migration of cells in a constant electric field, is important in regeneration, development, and wound healing. Electrotaxis has a slower response and a smaller dynamic range than guidance by other cues, suggesting that the mechanism of electrotaxis shares both similarities and differences with chemical-gradient-sensing pathways. We examine a mechanism centered on the excitable system consisting of cortical waves of biochemical signals coupled to cytoskeletal reorganization, which has been implicated in random cell motility. We use electro-fused giant <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells to decouple waves from cell motion and employ nanotopographic surfaces to limit wave dimensions and lifetimes. We demonstrate that wave propagation in these cells is guided by electric fields. The wave area and lifetime gradually increase in the first 10 min after an electric field is turned on, leading to more abundant and wider protrusions in the cell region nearest the cathode. The wave directions display 'U-turn' behavior upon field reversal, and this switch occurs more quickly on nanotopography. Our results suggest that electric fields guide cells by controlling waves of signal transduction and cytoskeletal activity, which underlie cellular protrusions. Whereas surface receptor occupancy triggers both rapid activation and slower polarization of signaling pathways, electric fields appear to act primarily on polarization, explaining why cells respond to electric fields more slowly than to other guidance cues.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis toward different cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations was tested in Dictyostelium discoideum cell lines with deletion of specific genes together with drugs to inhibit one or all combinations of the second-messenger systems PI3-kinase, phospholipase C (PLC), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and cytosolic Ca(2+). The results show that inhibition of either PI3-kinase or PLA2 inhibits chemotaxis in shallow cAMP gradients, whereas both enzymes must be inhibited to prevent chemotaxis in steep cAMP gradients, suggesting that PI3-kinase and PLA2 are two redundant mediators of chemotaxis. Mutant cells lacking PLC activity have normal chemotaxis; however, additional inhibition of PLA2 completely blocks chemotaxis, whereas inhibition of PI3-kinase has no effect, suggesting that all chemotaxis in plc-null cells is mediated by PLA2. Cells with deletion of the IP(3) receptor have the opposite phenotype: chemotaxis is completely dependent on PI3-kinase and insensitive to PLA2 inhibitors. This suggest that PI3-kinase-mediated chemotaxis is regulated by PLC, probably through controlling PIP(2) levels and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) activity, whereas chemotaxis mediated by PLA2 appears to be controlled by intracellular Ca(2+).",

Polarized epithelial tissues are a defining feature of metazoans and contribute to the diversity of animal body plans. The recent finding of a polarized epithelium in the non-metazoan social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum demonstrates that epithelial tissue is not a unique feature of metazoans, and challenges the traditional paradigm that multicellularity evolved independently in social amoebae and metazoans. An alternative view, presented here, is that the common ancestor of social amoebae, fungi, and animals spent a portion of its life cycle in a multicellular state and possessed molecular machinery necessary for forming an epithelial tissue. Some descendants of this ancestor retained multicellularity, while others reverted to unicellularity. This hypothesis makes testable predictions regarding tissue organization in close relatives of metazoans and provides a novel conceptual framework for studies of early animal evolution.",

We report here that the putative basic leucine zipper transcription factor BzpN plays a role in the inhibition of proliferation by AprA and CfaD. Cells lacking BzpN proliferate more rapidly than wild-type cells but do not reach a higher stationary density. Recombinant AprA inhibits wild-type cell proliferation but does not inhibit the proliferation of cells lacking BzpN. Recombinant CfaD also inhibits wild-type cell proliferation, but promotes the proliferation of cells lacking BzpN. Overexpression of BzpN results in a reduced cell density at stationary phase, and this phenotype requires AprA, CfaD, and the kinase QkgA. Conditioned media from high-density cells stops the proliferation of wild-type but not bzpN(-) cells and induces a nuclear localization of a BzpN-GFP fusion protein, though this localization does not require AprA or CfaD. Together, the data suggest that BzpN is necessary for some but not all of the effects of AprA and CfaD, and that BzpN may function downstream of AprA and CfaD in a signal transduction pathway that inhibits proliferation.",

Phagocytic <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> amoebae represent a powerful model system to study the intracellular mechanisms ensuring destruction of ingested bacteria in phagosomes. Here, we discovered the presence of a bacteriolytic activity against <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> in cellular extracts from <i>D. discoideum.</i> The bacteriolytic activity was detected only at a very acidic pH mimicking the conditions found in <i>D. discoideum</i> phagosomes. It was also strongly decreased in extracts of <i>kil1</i> KO cells that were previously described to kill inefficiently internalized bacteria, suggesting that the activity observed <i>in vitro</i> is involved in killing of bacteria in phagosomes. We purified a fraction enriched in bacteriolytic activity where only 16 proteins were detected and focused on four proteins selectively enriched in this fraction. Three of them belong to a poorly characterized family of <i>D. discoideum</i> proteins exhibiting a DUF3430 domain of unknown function and were named BadA (Bacteriolytic <i>D. discoideum</i> A), BadB, and BadC. We overexpressed the BadA protein in cells, and the bacteriolytic activity increased concomitantly in cell extracts. Conversely, depletion of BadA from cell extracts decreased significantly their bacteriolytic activity. Finally, in cells overexpressing BadA, bacterial killing was faster than in parental cells. Together these results identify BadA as a <i>D. discoideum</i> protein required for cellular bactericidal activity. They also define a new strategy to identify and characterize bactericidal proteins in <i>D. discoideum</i> cells.",

Transcript profiling of gstA1-gstA5 (alpha class) genes in vegetative, log phase cells identified gstA2 and gstA3 with highest expression (6-7.5-fold, respectively) when compared to other gstA transcripts. Marked reductions in all gstA transcripts occurred under starvation conditions, with gstA2 and gstA3 exhibiting the largest decreases (-96% and -86.6%, respectively). When compared to their pre-starvation levels, there was also a 60 percent reduction in total GST activity. Glutathione (GSH) pull-down assay and mass spectroscopy detected three isozymes (DdGSTA1, DdGSTA2 and DdGSTA3) that were predominantly expressed in vegetative cells. Biochemical and kinetic comparisons between rDdGSTA2 and rDdGSTA3 shows higher activity of rDdGSTA2 to the CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) substrate. RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous DdGSTA2 caused a 60 percent reduction in proliferation, delayed development, and altered morphogenesis of fruiting bodies, whereas overexpression of rDdGSTA2 enzyme had no effect.

By combining traditional genetic and biochemical assays with a statistical analysis of global gene expression profiles, we discerned a genetic interaction between Dictyostelium discoideum mek1, smkA (named for its role in the suppression of the mek1(-) mutation), and pppC (the protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit gene). We found that during development and chemotaxis, both mek1 and smkA regulate pppC function. In other organisms, the protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit, PP4C, functions in a complex with the regulatory subunits PP4R2 and PP4R3 to control recovery from DNA damage. Here, we show that catalytically active PP4C is also required for development, chemotaxis, and the expression of numerous genes. The product of smkA (SMEK) functions as the Dictyostelium PP4R3 homolog and positively regulates a subset of PP4C's functions: PP4C-mediated developmental progression, chemotaxis, and the expression of genes specifically involved in cell stress responses and cell movement. We also demonstrate that SMEK does not control the absolute level of PP4C activity and suggest that SMEK regulates PP4C by controlling its localization to the nucleus. These data define a novel genetic pathway in which mek1 functions upstream of pppC-smkA to control multicellular development and chemotaxis.",

We used direct morphometric characterization and laser-tracking microrheology to quantify cortical mechanical properties of wild-type and cortexillin-I and dynacortin mutant Dictyostelium cells. Both cortexillin-I and dynacortin influence cytokinesis and interphase cortical viscoelasticity as predicted from genetics and biochemical data using purified dynacortin proteins. Our studies suggest that the regulation of cytokinesis ultimately requires modulation of proteins that control the cortical mechanical properties that establish the force-balance that specifies the shapes of cytokinesis. The combination of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical observations suggests that the cell's cortical mechanical properties control how the cortex is remodeled during cytokinesis.",

However, efforts to examine sequential genome-wide changes of gene regulation in developmental processes have been fairly limited. Here we report the developmental regulatory dynamics of GtaC, a GATA-type zinc-finger transcription factor, through the analyses of serial ChIP- and RNA-sequencing data. GtaC is essential for developmental progression, decoding extracellular cAMP pulses during early development and may play a role in mediating cell-type differentiation at later stages. We find that GtaC exhibits temporally distinctive DNA-binding patterns concordant with each developmental stage. We identify direct GtaC targets and observe cotemporaneous GtaC-binding and developmental expression regulation. Our results suggest that GtaC regulates multiple physiological processes as Dictyostelium transitions from a group of unicellular amoebae to an integrated multicellular organism.",

        "abstract": "Blebs, pressure driven protrusions of the cell membrane, facilitate the movement of eukaryotic cells such as the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, white blood cells and cancer cells. Blebs initiate when the cell membrane separates from the underlying cortex. A local rupture of the cortex, has been suggested as a mechanism by which blebs are initiated. However, much clarity is still needed about how cells inherently regulate rupture of the cortex in locations where blebs are expected to form. In this work, we examine the role of membrane energy and the motor protein myosin II (myosin) in facilitating the cell driven rupture of the cortex. We perform under-agarose chemotaxis experiments, using Dictyostelium discoideum cells, to visualize the dynamics of myosin and calculate changes in membrane energy in the blebbing region. To facilitate a rapid detection of blebs and analysis of the energy and myosin distribution at the cell front, we introduce an autonomous bleb detection algorithm that takes in discrete cell boundaries and returns the coordinate location of blebs with its shape characteristics. We are able to identify by microscopy naturally occurring gaps in the cortex prior to membrane detachment at sites of bleb nucleation. These gaps form at positions calculated to have high membrane energy, and are associated with areas of myosin enrichment. Myosin is also shown to accumulate in the cortex prior to bleb initiation and just before the complete disassembly of the cortex. Together our findings provide direct spatial and temporal evidence to support cortex rupture as an intrinsic bleb initiation mechanism and suggests that myosin clusters are associated with regions of high membrane energy where its contractile activity leads to a rupture of the cortex at points of maximal energy.",

In Dictyostelium discoideum, DIRS-1 forms clusters that adopt the function of centromeres, rendering tight retrotransposition control critical to maintaining chromosome integrity. We report that in deletion strains of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RrpC, full-length and shorter DIRS-1 messenger RNAs are strongly enriched. Shorter versions of a hitherto unknown long non-coding RNA in DIRS-1 antisense orientation are also enriched in rrpC- strains. Concurrent with the accumulation of long transcripts, the vast majority of small (21 mer) DIRS-1 RNAs vanish in rrpC- strains. RNASeq reveals an asymmetric distribution of the DIRS-1 small RNAs, both along DIRS-1 and with respect to sense and antisense orientation. We show that RrpC is required for post-transcriptional DIRS-1 silencing and also for spreading of RNA silencing signals. Finally, DIRS-1 mis-regulation in the absence of RrpC leads to retrotransposon mobilization. In summary, our data reveal RrpC as a key player in the silencing of centromeric retrotransposon DIRS-1. RrpC acts at the post-transcriptional level and is involved in spreading of RNA silencing signals, both in the 5' and 3' directions.",

        "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PtdInsP(3)) mediates intracellular signaling for directional sensing and pseudopod extension at the leading edge of migrating cells during chemotaxis. How this PtdInsP(3) signal is translated into remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Here, using a proteomics approach, we identified multiple PtdInsP(3)-binding proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum, including five pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins. Two of these, the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B and the PH domain-containing protein PhdA, were previously characterized as PtdInsP(3)-binding proteins. In addition, PhdB, PhdG, and PhdI were identified as previously undescribed PH domain-containing proteins. Specific PtdInsP(3) interactions with PhdB, PhdG, and PhdI were confirmed using an in vitro lipid-binding assay. In cells, PhdI associated with the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on both the PH domain and PtdInsP(3). Consistent with this finding, PhdI located to the leading edge in migrating cells. In contrast, PhdG was found in the cytosol in WT cells. However, when PtdInsP(3) was overproduced in pten(-) cells, PhdG located to the plasma membrane, suggesting its weak affinity for PtdInsP(3). PhdB was found to bind to the plasma membrane via both PtdInsP(3)-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The PtdInsP(3)-independent interaction was mediated by the middle domain, independent of the PH domain. In migrating cells, the majority of PhdB was found at the lagging edge. Finally, we deleted the genes encoding PhdB and PhdG and demonstrated that both proteins are required for efficient chemotaxis. Thus, this study advances our understanding of the PtdInsP(3)-mediated signaling mechanisms that control directed cell migration in chemotaxis.",

Evolutionary theory predicts that polymorphism in recognition cues, which is essential for effective recognition, would be unstable. Individuals carrying rare recognition cues would benefit less from social interactions than individuals with common cues, leading to loss of the genetic-cue diversity. We test this evolutionary hypothesis in Dictyostelium discoideum, which forms multicellular fruiting bodies by aggregation and utilizes two polymorphic membrane proteins to facilitate preferential cooperation. Surprisingly, we find that rare recognition variants are tolerated and maintain their frequencies among incompatible majority during development. Although the rare variants are initially excluded from the aggregates, they subsequently rejoin the aggregate and produce spores. Social cheating is also refrained in late development, thus limiting the cost of chimerism. Our results suggest a potential mechanism to sustain the evolutionary stability of kin-recognition genes and to suppress cheating.",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted the self-centering activities of individual microtubule (MT) arrays in animal cells, but relatively few works address the behavior of multiple arrays that coexist in a common cytoplasm. In multinucleated <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells, each centrosome organizes a radial MT network, and these networks remain separate from one another. This feature offers an opportunity to reveal the mechanism(s) responsible for the positioning of multiple centrosomes. Using a laser microbeam to eliminate one of the two centrosomes in binucleate cells, we show that the unaltered array is rapidly repositioned at the cell center. This result demonstrates that each MT array is constantly subject to centering forces and infers a mechanism to balance the positions of multiple arrays. Our results address the limited actions of three kinesins and a cross-linking MAP that are known to have effects in maintaining MT organization and suggest a simple means used to keep the arrays separated.",

        "abstract": "The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of nine neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a polyQ tract that results in protein aggregation. Unlike other model organisms, Dictyostelium discoideum is a proteostatic outlier, naturally encoding long polyQ tracts yet resistant to polyQ aggregation. Here we identify serine-rich chaperone protein 1 (SRCP1) as a molecular chaperone that is necessary and sufficient to suppress polyQ aggregation. SRCP1 inhibits aggregation of polyQ-expanded proteins, allowing for their degradation via the proteasome, where SRCP1 is also degraded. SRCP1's C-terminal domain is essential for its activity in cells, and peptides that mimic this domain suppress polyQ aggregation in\u00a0vitro. Together our results identify a\u00a0novel type of molecular chaperone and reveal how nature has dealt with the problem of polyQ aggregation.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial Complex II is composed of four core subunits and mutations to any of the subunits result in lowered Complex II activity. Surprisingly, although mutations in any of the subunits can yield similar clinical outcomes, there are distinct differences in the patterns of clinical disease most commonly associated with mutations in different subunits. Thus, mutations to the SdhA subunit most often result in mitochondrial disease phenotypes, whilst mutations to the other subunits SdhB-D more commonly result in tumour formation. The reason the clinical outcomes are so different is unknown. Here, we individually antisense-inhibited three of the Complex II subunits, SdhA, SdhB or SdhC, in the simple model organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Whilst SdhB and SdhC knockdown resulted in growth defects on bacterial lawns, antisense inhibition of SdhA expression resulted in a different pattern of phenotypic defects, including impairments of growth in liquid medium, enhanced intracellular proliferation of the bacterial pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> and phagocytosis. Knockdown of the individual subunits also produced different abnormalities in mitochondrial function with only SdhA knockdown resulting in broad mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, these defects were shown to be mediated by the chronic activation of the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase. Our results are in agreement with a role for loss of function of SdhA but not the other Complex II subunits in impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and they suggest a role for AMP-activated protein kinase in mediating the cytopathological outcomes.",

P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat effectively because of the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In this study, we analyzed whether the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum can be used as a simple model system to analyze the virulence of P. aeruginosa strains. The virulent wild-type strain PAO1 was shown to inhibit growth of D. discoideum. Isogenic mutants deficient in the las quorum-sensing system were almost as inhibitory as the wild type, while rhl quorum-sensing mutants permitted growth of Dictyostelium cells. Therefore, in this model system, factors controlled by the rhl quorum-sensing system were found to play a central role. Among these, rhamnolipids secreted by the wild-type strain PAO1 could induce fast lysis of D. discoideum cells. By using this simple model system, we predicted that certain antibiotic-resistant mutants of P. aeruginosa should show reduced virulence. This result was confirmed in a rat model of acute pneumonia. Thus, D. discoideum could be used as a simple nonmammalian host system to assess pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa.",

        "abstract": "Many protozoa form spores in response to adversity; therefore, spore germination is a key process in their life cycle. Dictyostelium discoideum sporulates in response to starvation following a developmental program. Germination is characterized by two visible changes, spore swelling and the emergence of amoeba from the spore capsule. Several studies have indicated that an additional process termed spore activation is also required, but the physiological changes that characterize the three phases are largely uncharacterized. We used microarrays to monitor global transcriptional transitions as a surrogate measure of the physiological changes that occur during germination. Using two independent methods to induce germination, we identified changes in mRNA levels that characterized the germination process rather than changes that resulted from the induction method. We found that germination is characterized by three transitions. The first transition occurs during activation, while the spores appear dormant, the largest transition occurs when swelling begins, and the third transition occurs when emergence begins. These findings indicate that activation and swelling are not passive occurrences, such as dilution of inhibitors or spore rehydration, but are active processes that are accompanied by dramatic events in mRNA degradation and de novo transcription. These findings confirm and extend earlier reports that genes such as celA are regulated during spore germination. We also found by mutation analysis that the unconventional myosin gene myoI, which is induced during early germination, plays roles in the maintenance of dormancy and in spore swelling. This finding suggests that some of the observed transcriptional changes are required for spore germination.",

        "abstract": "Deciphering how enzymes interact, modify, and recognize carbohydrates has long been a topic of interest in academic, pharmaceutical, and industrial research. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are noncatalytic globular protein domains attached to carbohydrate-active enzymes that strengthen enzyme affinity to substrates and increase enzymatic efficiency via targeting and proximity effects. CBMs are considered auspicious for various biotechnological purposes in textile, food, and feed industries, representing valuable tools in basic science research and biomedicine. Here, we present the first crystallographic structure of a CBM8 family member (CBM8), DdCBM8, from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, which was identified attached to an endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase (glycoside hydrolase family 9). We show that the planar carbohydrate-binding site of DdCBM8, composed of aromatic residues, is similar to type A CBMs that are specific for crystalline (multichain) polysaccharides. Accordingly, pull-down assays indicated that DdCBM8 was able to bind insoluble forms of cellulose. However, affinity gel electrophoresis demonstrated that DdCBM8 also bound to soluble (single chain) polysaccharides, especially glucomannan, similar to type B CBMs, although it had no apparent affinity for oligosaccharides. Therefore, the structural characteristics and broad specificity of DdCBM8 represent exceptions to the canonical CBM classification. In addition, mutational analysis identified specific amino acid residues involved in ligand recognition, which are conserved throughout the CBM8 family. This advancement in the structural and functional characterization of CBMs contributes to our understanding of carbohydrate-active enzymes and protein-carbohydrate interactions, pushing forward protein engineering strategies and enhancing the potential biotechnological applications of glycoside hydrolase accessory modules.",

The relationship between <i>D. discoideum</i> and <i>Paraburkholderia</i> has been shown to take place across many strains and a large geographical area, but little is known about <i>Paraburkholderia</i>'s potential interaction with other dictyostelid species. We explore the ability of three <i>Paraburkholderia</i> species to stably infect and induce bacterial carriage in other dictyostelid hosts. We found that all three <i>Paraburkholderia</i> species successfully infected and induced carriage in seven species of <i>Dictyostelium</i> hosts. While the overall behaviour was qualitatively similar to that previously observed in infections of <i>D. discoideum</i>, differences in the outcomes of different host/symbiont combinations suggest a degree of specialization between partners. <i>Paraburkholderia</i> was unable to maintain a stable association with the more distantly related host <i>Polysphondylium violaceum</i>. Our results suggest that the mechanisms and evolutionary history of <i>Paraburkholderia</i>'s symbiotic relationships may be general within <i>Dictyostelium</i> hosts, but not so general that it can associate with hosts of other genera.

        "abstract": "Microbes have interacted with eukaryotic cells for as long as they have been co-existing. While many of these interactions are beneficial for both the microbe as well as the eukaryotic cell, several microbes have evolved into pathogenic species. For some of these pathogens, host cell invasion results in irreparable damage and thus host cell destruction, whereas others use the host to avoid immune detection and elimination. One of the latter pathogens is <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, arguably one of the most notorious pathogens on earth. In mammalian macrophages, <i>M. tuberculosis</i> manages to survive within infected macrophages by avoiding intracellular degradation in lysosomes using a number of different strategies. One of these is based on the recruitment and phagosomal retention of the host protein coronin 1, that is a member of the coronin protein family and a mammalian homolog of coronin A, a protein identified in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. Besides mediating mycobacterial survival in macrophages, coronin 1 is also an important regulator of na\u00efve T cell homeostasis. How, exactly, coronin 1 mediates its activity in immune cells remains unclear. While in lower eukaryotes coronins are involved in cytoskeletal regulation, the functions of the seven coronin members in mammals are less clear. <i>Dictyostelium</i> coronins may have maintained multiple functions, whereas the mammalian coronins may have evolved from regulators of the cytoskeleton to modulators of signal transduction. In this minireview, we will discuss the different studies that have contributed to understand the molecular and cellular functions of coronin proteins in mammals and <i>Dictyostelium</i>.",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotic cells can detect gradients of chemical signals in their environments and migrate accordingly (1). This guided cell migration is referred as chemotaxis, which is essential for various cells to carry out their functions such as trafficking of immune cells and patterning of neuronal cells (2, 3). A large family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) detects variable small peptides, known as chemokines, to direct cell migration in vivo (4). The final goal of chemotaxis research is to understand how a GPCR machinery senses chemokine gradients and controls signaling events leading to chemotaxis. To this end, we use imaging techniques to monitor, in real time, spatiotemporal concentrations of chemoattractants, cell movement in a gradient of chemoattractant, GPCR mediated activation of heterotrimeric G-protein, and intracellular signaling events involved in chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells (5-8). The simple eukaryotic organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, displays chemotaxic behaviors that are similar to those of leukocytes, and D. discoideum is a key model system for studying eukaryotic chemotaxis. As free-living amoebae, D. discoideum cells divide in rich medium. Upon starvation, cells enter a developmental program in which they aggregate through cAMP-mediated chemotaxis to form multicullular structures. Many components involved in chemotaxis to cAMP have been identified in D. discoideum. The binding of cAMP to a GPCR (cAR1) induces dissociation of heterotrimeric G-proteins into G\u03b3 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits (7, 9, 10). G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits activate Ras, which in turn activates PI3K, converting PIP(2;) into PIP(3;) on the cell membrane (11-13). PIP(3;) serve as binding sites for proteins with pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains, thus recruiting these proteins to the membrane (14, 15). Activation of cAR1 receptors also controls the membrane associations of PTEN, which dephosphorylates PIP(3;) to PIP(2;)(16, 17). The molecular mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved in chemokine GPCR-mediated chemotaxis of human cells such as neutrophils (18). We present following methods for studying chemotaxis of D. discoideum cells. 1. Preparation of chemotactic component cells. 2. Imaging chemotaxis of cells in a cAMP gradient. 3. Monitoring a GPCR induced activation of heterotrimeric G-protein in single live cells. 4. Imaging chemoattractant-triggered dynamic PIP(3;) responses in single live cells in real time. Our developed imaging methods can be applied to study chemotaxis of human leukocytes.",

The regulation of NAEs in vivo is partly accomplished by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyses NAEs to ethanolamine and their corresponding fatty acid. Inhibition of FAAH has been shown to increase the levels of NAEs in vivo and to produce desirable phenotypes. This has led to the development of pharmaceutical-based therapies for a variety of conditions targeting FAAH. Recently, our group identified a functional FAAH homolog in Dictyostelium discoideum, leading to our hypothesis that D. discoideum also possesses NAEs. In this study, we provide a further characterization of FAAH and identify NAEs in D. discoideum for the first time. We also demonstrate the ability to modulate their levels in vivo through the use of a semispecific FAAH inhibitor and confirm that these NAEs are FAAH substrates through in vitro studies. We believe the demonstration of the in vivo modulation of NAE levels suggests that D. discoideum could be a good simple model organism in which to study NAE-mediated signaling.",

        "abstract": "Lipid droplet formation and subsequent steatosis (the abnormal retention of lipids within a cell) has been reported to contribute to hepatotoxicity and is an adverse effect of many pharmacological agents including the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA). In this study, we have developed a simple model system (Dictyostelium discoideum) to investigate the effects of VPA and related compounds in lipid droplet formation. In mammalian hepatocytes, VPA increases lipid droplet accumulation over a 24-hour period, giving rise to liver cell damage, and we show a similar effect in Dictyostelium following 30 minutes of VPA treatment. Using (3)H-labelled polyunsaturated (arachidonic) or saturated (palmitic) fatty acids, we shown that VPA treatment of Dictyostelium gives rise to an increased accumulation of both types of fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and non-polar lipids in this time period, with a similar trend observed in human hepatocytes (Huh7 cells) labelled with [(3)H]arachidonic acid. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of \u03b2-oxidation in Dictyostelium phenocopies fatty acid accumulation, in agreement with data reported in mammalian systems. Using Dictyostelium, we then screened a range of VPA-related compounds to identify those with high and low lipid-accumulation potential, and validated these activities for effects on lipid droplet formation by using human hepatocytes. Structure-activity relationships for these VPA-related compounds suggest that lipid accumulation is independent of VPA-catalysed teratogenicity and inositol depletion. These results suggest that Dictyostelium could provide both a novel model system for the analysis of lipid droplet formation in human hepatocytes and a rapid method for identifying VPA-related compounds that show liver toxicology.",

Previously, we showed that the transmission of pathogenic mycobacteria between phagocytic cells also depends on nonlytic ejection through an F-actin based structure, called the ejectosome. How the host cell maintains integrity of its plasma membrane during the ejection process was unknown. Here, we reveal an unexpected function for the autophagic machinery in nonlytic spreading of bacteria. We show that ejecting mycobacteria are escorted by a distinct polar autophagocytic vacuole. If autophagy is impaired, cell-to-cell transmission is inhibited, the host plasma membrane becomes compromised and the host cells die. These findings highlight a previously unidentified, highly ordered interaction between bacteria and the autophagic pathway and might represent the ancient way to ensure nonlytic egress of bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Phagocytosis is an evolutionarily conserved biological process where pathogens or cellular debris are cleared by engulfing them in a membrane-enclosed cellular compartment called the phagosome. The formation, maturation, and subsequent degradation of a phagosome is an important immune response essential for protection against many pathogens. Yet, the global lipid profile of phagosomes remains unknown, especially as a function of their maturation in immune cells. Here, we show using mass spectrometry based quantitative lipidomics that the ceramide class of lipids, especially very long chain ceramides, are enriched on maturing phagosomes with a concomitant decrease in the biosynthetic precursors of ceramides. We thus posit a new function for the enzyme ceramide synthase during phagocytosis in mammalian macrophages. Biochemical assays, cellular lipid feeding experiments, and pharmacological blockade of ceramide synthase together show that this enzyme indeed controls the flux of ceramides on maturing phagosomes. We also find similar results in the primitive eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, suggesting that ceramide enrichment may be evolutionarily conserved and likely an indispensible step in phagosome maturation.",

        "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase DdERK2 is critical for cyclic AMP (cAMP) relay and chemotaxis to cAMP and folate, but the details downstream of DdERK2 are unclear. To search for targets of DdERK2 in Dictyostelium discoideum, 32PO4(3-)-labeled protein samples from wild-type and Dderk2- cells were resolved by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry was used to identify a novel 45-kDa protein, named EppA (ERK2-dependent phosphoprotein A), as a substrate of DdERK2 in Dictyostelium. Mutation of potential DdERK2 phosphorylation sites demonstrated that phosphorylation on serine 250 of EppA is DdERK2 dependent. Changing serine 250 to alanine delayed development of Dictyostelium and reduced Dictyostelium chemotaxis to cAMP. Although overexpression of EppA had no significant effect on the development or chemotaxis of Dictyostelium, disruption of the eppA gene led to delayed development and reduced chemotactic responses to both cAMP and folate. Both eppA gene disruption and overexpression of EppA carrying the serine 250-to-alanine mutation led to inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation in response to chemoattractant cAMP, a pivotal process in Dictyostelium chemotaxis and development. Our studies indicate that EppA regulates extracellular cAMP-induced signal relay and chemotaxis of Dictyostelium.",

The pivotal enzymes for terpene biosynthesis, terpene synthases (TPSs), had been described only in plants and fungi in the eukaryotic domain. In this report, we systematically analyzed the genome sequences of a broad range of nonplant/nonfungus eukaryotes and identified putative TPS genes in six species of amoebae, five of which are multicellular social amoebae from the order of Dictyosteliida. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that amoebal TPSs are evolutionarily more closely related to fungal TPSs than to bacterial TPSs. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum was selected for functional study of the identified TPSs. D. discoideum grows as a unicellular organism when food is abundant and switches from vegetative growth to multicellular development upon starvation. We found that expression of most D. discoideum TPS genes was induced during development. Upon heterologous expression, all nine TPSs from D. discoideum showed sesquiterpene synthase activities. Some also exhibited monoterpene and/or diterpene synthase activities. Direct measurement of volatile terpenes in cultures of D. discoideum revealed essentially no emission at an early stage of development. In contrast, a bouquet of terpenes, dominated by sesquiterpenes including \u03b2-barbatene and (E,E)-\u03b1-farnesene, was detected at the middle and late stages of development, suggesting a development-specific function of volatile terpenes in D. discoideum. The patchy distribution of TPS genes in the eukaryotic domain and the evidence for TPS function in D. discoideum indicate that the TPS genes mediate lineage-specific adaptations.",

It remains currently unclear, how the centromeric function is achieved by widely differing structures. Since centromeres are often large and consist mainly of repetitive sequences they have only been analyzed in great detail in a handful of organisms. The genome of Dictyostelium discoideum, a valuable model organism, was described a few years ago but its centromere organization remained largely unclear. Using available sequence information we reconstructed the putative centromere organization in three of the six chromosomes of D. discoideum. They mainly consist of one type of transposons that is confined to centromeric regions. Centromeres are dynamic due to transposon integration, but an optimal centromere size seems to exist in D. discoideum. One centromere probably has expanded recently, whereas another underwent major rearrangements. In addition to insights into the centromere organization and dynamics of a protist eukaryote, this work also provides a starting point for the analysis of the evolution of centromere structures in social amoebas by comparative genomics.",

Although in animal cells, a combination of centrosome nucleating properties and polymer dynamics at the distal microtubule ends is generally sufficient to establish a radial, polar array of MTs, little is known about how effector proteins (motors and crosslinkers) are coordinated to produce the diversity of interphase MT array morphologies found in nature. This diversity is particularly important in multinucleated environments where multiple MT arrays must coexist and function. We initiate here a study to address the higher ordered coordination of multiple, independent MT arrays in a common cytoplasm. Deletion of a MT crosslinker of the MAP65/Ase1/PRC1 family disrupts the spatial integrity of multiple arrays in Dictyostelium discoideum, reducing the distance between centrosomes and increasing the intermingling of MTs with opposite polarity. This result, coupled with previous dynein disruptions suggest a robust mechanism by which interphase MT arrays can utilize motors and crosslinkers to sense their position and minimize overlap in a common cytoplasm.",

A genome-wide library of 27,405 gRNAs and a kinase library of 4,582 gRNAs were compiled and mutant pools were generated. The resulting mutants were screened for defects in cell growth and more than 10 candidate genes were identified. Six of these were validated and five recreated mutants presented with growth abnormalities.

        "abstract": "Ca2+ responses to two chemoattractants, folate and cyclic AMP (cAMP), were assayed in Dictyostelium D. discoideum mutants deficient in one or both of two abundant Ca2+-binding proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), calreticulin and calnexin. Mutants deficient in either or both proteins exhibited enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ responses to both attractants. Not only were the mutant responses greater in amplitude, but they also exhibited earlier onsets, faster rise rates, earlier peaks, and faster fall rates. Correlations among these kinetic parameters and the response amplitudes suggested that key events in the Ca2+ response are autoregulated by the magnitude of the response itself, i.e., by cytosolic Ca2+ levels. This autoregulation was sufficient to explain the altered kinetics of the mutant responses: larger responses are faster in both mutant and wild-type cells in response to both folate (vegetative cells) and cAMP (differentiated cells). Searches of the predicted D. discoideum proteome revealed three putative Ca2+ pumps and four putative Ca2+ channels. All but one contained sequence motifs for Ca2+- or calmodulin-binding sites, consistent with Ca2+ signals being autoregulatory. Although cytosolic Ca2+ responses in the calnexin and calreticulin mutants are enhanced, the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium into the mutant cells was smaller. Compared to wild-type cells, Ca2+ release from the ER in the mutants thus contributes more to the total cytosolic Ca2+ response while influx from the extracellular medium contributes less. These results provide the first molecular genetic evidence that release of Ca2+ from the ER contributes to cytosolic Ca2+ responses in D. discoideum.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum has largely been used to study phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria. Previous studies have shown that Phg1A, Kil1 and Kil2 proteins are necessary for efficient intracellular killing of Klebsiella bacteria. Here we show that in phg1a KO cells, cellular levels of lysosomal glycosidases and lysozyme are decreased, and lysosomal pH is increased. Surprisingly, overexpression of Kil1 restores efficient killing in phg1a KO cells without correcting these lysosomal anomalies. Conversely, kil1 KO cells are defective for killing, but their enzymatic content and lysosomal pH are indistinguishable from WT cells. The killing defect of phg1a KO cells can be accounted for by the observation that in these cells the stability and the cellular amount of Kil1 are markedly reduced. Since Kil1 is the only sulfotransferase characterized in Dictyostelium, an (unidentified) sulfated factor, defective in both phg1a and kil1 KO cells, may play a key role in intracellular killing of Klebsiella bacteria. In addition, Phg1B plays a redundant role with Phg1A in controlling cellular amounts of Kil1 and intracellular killing. Finally, cellular levels of Kil1 are unaffected in kil2 KO cells, and Kil1 overexpression does not correct the killing defect of kil2 KO cells, suggesting that Kil2 plays a distinct role in intracellular killing.",

        "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative disorders, although related by their destruction of brain function, display remarkable cellular and/or regional pathogenic specificity likely due to a deregulated functionality of the mutant protein. However, neurodegenerative disease genes, for example huntingtin (HTT), the ataxins, the presenilins (PSEN1/PSEN2) are not simply localized to neurons but are ubiquitously expressed throughout peripheral tissues; it is therefore paramount to properly understand the earliest precipitating events leading to neuronal pathogenesis to develop effective long-term therapies. This means, in no unequivocal terms, it is crucial to understand the gene's normal function. Unfortunately, many genes are often essential for embryogenesis which precludes their study in whole organisms. This is true for HTT, the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins, responsible for early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better understand neurological disease in humans, many lower and higher eukaryotic models have been established. So the question arises: how reasonable is the use of organisms to study neurological disorders when the model of choice does not contain neurons? Here we will review the surprising, and novel emerging use of the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum, a species of soil-living amoeba, as a valuable biomedical tool to study the normal function of neurodegenerative genes. Historically, the evidence on the usefulness of simple organisms to understand the etiology of cellular pathology cannot be denied. But using an organism without a central nervous system to understand diseases of the brain? We will first introduce the life cycle of Dictyostelium, the presence of many disease genes in the genome and how it has provided unique opportunities to identify mechanisms of disease involving actin pathologies, mitochondrial disease, human lysosomal and trafficking disorders and host-pathogen interactions. Secondly, I will highlight recent studies on the function of HTT, presenilin \u03b3-secretase and Hirano bodies conducted in Dictyostelium. I will then outline the limitations and future directions in using Dictyostelium to study disease, and finally conclude that given the evolutionary conservation of genes between Dictyostelium and humans and the organisms' genetic tractability, that this system provides a fertile environment for discovering normal gene function related to neurodegeneration and will permit translational studies in higher systems.",

        "abstract": "Encapsulation of prespore cells of Dictyostelium discoideum is controlled by several intercellular signals to ensure appropriate timing during fruiting body formation. Acyl-CoA-binding protein, AcbA, is secreted by prespore cells and processed by the prestalk protease TagC to form the 34 amino acid peptide SDF-2 that triggers rapid encapsulation. AcbA is secreted when gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is released from prespore cells and binds to GrlE, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Analysis of SDF-2 production in mutant strains lacking Galpha subunits and GPCRs, either as pure populations or when mixed with other mutant strains, uncovered the non-cell-autonomous roles of GrlA, Galpha4 and Galpha7. We found that Galpha7 is essential for the response to GABA and is likely to be coupled to GrlE. GrlA-null and Galpha4-null cells respond normally to GABA but fail to secrete it. We found that they are necessary for the response to a small hydrophobic molecule, SDF-3, which is released late in culmination. Pharmacological inhibition of steroidogenesis during development blocked the production of SDF-3. Moreover, the response to SDF-3 could be blocked by the steroid antagonist mifepristone, whereas hydrocortisone and other steroids mimicked the effects of SDF-3 when added in the nanomolar range. It appears that SDF-3 is a steroid that elicits rapid release of GABA by acting through the GPCR GrlA, coupled to G protein containing the Galpha4 subunit. SDF-3 is at the head of the cascade that amplifies the signal for encapsulation to ensure the rapid, synchronous formation of spores.",

Phg1, Phg2, myosin VII, and talin all play similar roles in cellular adhesion. Like myosin VII and talin, Phg2 also is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, phg2 mutant cells have defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the cell-substrate interface, and in cell motility. Because these last two defects are not seen in phg1, myoVII, or talin mutants, this suggests a specific role for Phg2 in the control of local actin polymerization/depolymerization.

        "abstract": "The network of protein-protein interactions of the Dictyostelium discoideum autophagy pathway was investigated by yeast two-hybrid screening of the conserved autophagic proteins Atg1 and Atg8. These analyses confirmed expected interactions described in other organisms and also identified novel interactors that highlight the complexity of autophagy regulation. The Atg1 kinase complex, an essential regulator of autophagy, was investigated in detail here. The composition of the Atg1 complex in D. discoideum is more similar to mammalian cells than to Saccharomyces cerevisiae as, besides Atg13, it contains Atg101, a protein not conserved in this yeast. We found that Atg101 interacts with Atg13 and genetic disruption of these proteins in Dictyostelium leads to an early block in autophagy, although the severity of the developmental phenotype and the degree of autophagic block is higher in Atg13-deficient cells. We have also identified a protein containing zinc-finger B-box and FNIP motifs that interacts with Atg101. Disruption of this protein increases autophagic flux, suggesting that it functions as a negative regulator of Atg101. We also describe the interaction of Atg1 kinase with the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme transketolase (TKT). We found changes in the activity of endogenous TKT activity in strains lacking or overexpressing Atg1, suggesting the presence of an unsuspected regulatory pathway between autophagy and the pentose phosphate pathway in Dictyostelium that seems to be conserved in mammalian cells.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in Ras isoforms such as K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras contribute to roughly 85, 15, and 1% of human cancers, respectively. Proper membrane targeting of these Ras isoforms, a prerequisite for Ras activity, requires farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at the C-terminal CAAX box. We devised an in vivo screening strategy based on monitoring Ras activation and phenotypic physiological outputs for assaying synthetic Ras function inhibitors (RFI). Ras activity was visualized by the translocation of RBD Raf1 -GFP to activated Ras at the plasma membrane. By using this strategy, we screened one synthetic farnesyl substrate analog (AGOH) along with nine putative inhibitors and found that only m-CN-AGOH inhibited Ras activation. Phenotypic analysis of starving cells could be used to monitor polarization, motility, and the inability of these treated cells to aggregate properly during fruiting body formation. Incorporation of AGOH and m-CN-AGOH to cellular proteins was detected by western blot. These screening assays can be incorporated into a high throughput screening format using Dictyostelium discoideum and automated microscopy to determine effective RFIs. These RFI candidates can then be further tested in mammalian systems.",

To meet this challenge, some Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons have evolved targeted integration at safe sites in the immediate vicinity of tRNA genes. Integration of yeast Ty3 is mediated by interactions of retrotransposon protein with the tRNA gene-specific transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB). In the genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, the non-LTR retrotransposon TRE5-A integrates approximately 48 bp upstream of tRNA genes, yet little is known about how the retrotransposon identifies integration sites. Here, we show direct protein interactions of the TRE5-A ORF1 protein with subunits of TFIIIB, suggesting that ORF1p is a component of the TRE5-A preintegration complex that determines integration sites. Our results demonstrate that evolution has put forth similar solutions to prevent damage of diverse, compact genomes by different classes of mobile elements.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about how a morphogenetic rearrangement of a tissue is affected by individual cells. Starving Dictyostelium discoideum cells aggregate to form dendritic streams, which then break up into groups of approximately 2 x 10(4) cells. Cell number is sensed at this developmental stage by using counting factor (CF), a secreted complex of polypeptides. A high extracellular concentration of CF indicates that there is a large number of cells, which then causes the aggregation stream to break up. Computer simulations indicated that stream breakup could be caused by CF decreasing cell-cell adhesion and/or increasing cell motility, and we observed that CF does indeed decrease cell-cell adhesion. We find here that CF increases cell motility. In Dictyostelium, motility is mediated by actin and myosin. CF increases the amounts of polymerized actin and the ABP-120 actin-crosslinking protein. Partially inhibiting motility by using drugs that interfere with actin polymerization reduces stream dissipation, resulting in fewer stream breaks and thus larger groups. CF also potentiates the phosphorylation and redistribution of myosin while repressing its basal level of assembly. The computer simulations indicated that a narrower distribution of group sizes results when a secreted factor modulates both adhesion and motility. CF thus seems to induce the morphogenesis of streams into evenly sized groups by increasing actin polymerization, ABP-120 levels, and myosin phosphorylation and decreasing adhesion and myosin polymerization.",

In vivo association of the Galpha4 subunit and ERK2 was demonstrated by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Alteration of the D-motif reduced Galpha4 subunit-ERK2 interactions but only slightly altered MAPK activation in response to folate. Expression of the Galpha4 subunit with the altered D-motif in galpha4(-)cells allowed for slug formation but not the morphogenesis associated with culmination. Expression of this mutant Galpha4 subunit was sufficient to rescue chemotactic movement to folate. Alteration of the D-motif also reduced the aggregation defect associated with constitutively active Galpha4 subunits. These results suggest Galpha4 subunit-MAPK interactions are necessary for developmental morphogenesis but not for chemotaxis to folate.",

Although there is very little sequence similarity between AprA and any human protein, AprA has a predicted structural similarity to the human protein dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). AprA is a chemorepellent for Dictyostelium cells, and DPPIV is a chemorepellent for neutrophils. This led us to investigate if AprA and DPPIV have additional functional similarities. We find that like AprA, DPPIV is a chemorepellent for, and inhibits the proliferation of, D. discoideum cells, and that AprA binds some DPPIV binding partners such as fibronectin. Conversely, rAprA has DPPIV-like protease activity. These results indicate a functional similarity between two eukaryotic chemorepellent proteins with very little sequence similarity, and emphasize the usefulness of using a predicted protein structure to search a protein structure database, in addition to searching for proteins with similar sequences.",

        "title": "Strategic investment explains patterns of cooperation and cheating in a microbe.",
        "abstract": "Contributing to cooperation is typically costly, while its rewards are often available to all members of a social group. So why should individuals be willing to pay these costs, especially if they could cheat by exploiting the investments of others? Kin selection theory broadly predicts that individuals should invest more into cooperation if their relatedness to group members is high (assuming they can discriminate kin from nonkin). To better understand how relatedness affects cooperation, we derived the \u201fCollective Investment\" game, which provides quantitative predictions for patterns of strategic investment depending on the level of relatedness. We then tested these predictions by experimentally manipulating relatedness (genotype frequencies) in mixed cooperative aggregations of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, which builds a stalk to facilitate spore dispersal. Measurements of stalk investment by natural strains correspond to the predicted patterns of relatedness-dependent strategic investment, wherein investment by a strain increases with its relatedness to the group. Furthermore, if overall group relatedness is relatively low (i.e., no strain is at high frequency in a group) strains face a scenario akin to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" and suffer from insufficient collective investment. We find that strains employ relatedness-dependent segregation to avoid these pernicious conditions. These findings demonstrate that simple organisms like <i>D. discoideum</i> are not restricted to being \u201fcheaters\" or \u201fcooperators\" but instead measure their relatedness to their group and strategically modulate their investment into cooperation accordingly. Consequently, all individuals will sometimes appear to cooperate and sometimes cheat due to the dynamics of strategic investing.",

        "abstract": "Directed cell migration toward spatio-temporally varying chemotactic stimuli requires rapid cytoskeletal reorganization. Numerous studies provide evidence that actin reorganization is controlled by intracellular redistribution of signaling molecules, such as the PI4,5P2/PI3,4,5P3 gradient. However, exploring underlying mechanisms is difficult and requires careful spatio-temporal control of external chemotactic stimuli. We designed a microfluidic setup to generate alternating chemotactic gradient fields for simultaneous multicell exposure, greatly facilitating statistical analysis. For a quantitative description of intracellular response dynamics, we apply alternating time sequences of spatially homogeneous concentration gradients across 300 \u03bcm, reorienting on timescales down to a few seconds. Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae respond to gradient switching rates below 0.02 Hz by readapting their migration direction. For faster switching, cellular repolarization ceases and is completely stalled at 0.1 Hz. In this \"chemotactically trapped\" cell state, external stimuli alternate faster than intracellular feedback is capable to respond by onset of directed migration. To investigate intracellular actin cortex rearrangement during gradient switching, we correlate migratory cell response with actin repolymerization dynamics, quantified by a fluorescence distribution moment of the GFP fusion protein LimE\u0394cc. We find two fundamentally different cell polarization types and we could reveal the role of PI3-Kinase for cellular repolarization. In the early aggregation phase, PI3-Kinase enhances the capability of D. discoideum cells to readjust their polarity in response to spatially alternating gradient fields, whereas in aggregation competent cells the effect of PI3-Kinase perturbation becomes less relevant.",

Better measurements are needed to ultimately build models with predictive capabilities. We present an improved force cytometry method and apply it to the analysis of the dynamics of the chemotactic migration of the amoeboid form of Dictyostelium discoideum. Our explicit calculation of the force field takes into account the finite thickness of the elastic substrate and improves the accuracy and resolution compared with previous methods. This approach enables us to quantitatively study the differences in the mechanics of the migration of wild-type (WT) and mutant cell lines. The time evolution of the strain energy exerted by the migrating cells on their substrate is quasi-periodic and can be used as a simple indicator of the stages of the cell motility cycle. We have found that the mean velocity of migration v and the period of the strain energy T cycle are related through a hyperbolic law v = L/T, where L is a constant step length that remains unchanged in mutants with adhesion or contraction defects. Furthermore, when cells adhere to the substrate, they exert opposing pole forces that are orders of magnitude higher than required to overcome the resistance from their environment.",

Local alignment algorithms such as BLAST are therefore ill-suited for the discovery of new homologs of such ncRNAs in genomic sequences.

Although little is known of the signaling pathways that mediate encystation, the analogous process of spore formation in dictyostelid social amoebas is better understood. In Dictyostelium discoideum, secreted cyclic AMP (cAMP) mediates the aggregation of starving amoebas and induces the differentiation of prespore cells. Intracellular cAMP acting on cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) triggers the maturation of spores and prevents their germination under the prevalent conditions of high osmolality in the spore head. The osmolyte-activated adenylate cyclase, ACG, produces cAMP for prespore differentiation and inhibition of spore germination. To retrace the origin of ACG function, we investigated ACG gene conservation and function in species that span the dictyostelid phylogeny. ACG genes, osmolyte-activated ACG activity, and osmoregulation of spore germination were detected in species that represent the 4 major groups of Dictyostelia. Unlike the derived species D. discoideum, many basal Dictyostelia have retained the ancestral mechanism of encystation from solitary amoebas. In these species and in solitary amoebas, encystation is independently triggered by starvation or by high osmolality. Osmolyte-induced encystation was accompanied by an increase in cAMP and prevented by inhibition of PKA, indicating that ACG and PKA activation mediate this response. We propose that high osmolality signals drought in soil amoebas and that developmental cAMP signaling in the Dictyostelia has evolved from this stress response.",

The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> has a high genomic potential for producing polyketides to mediate its ecological interactions, including the unique 'Steely' enzymes, consisting of a fusion between a fatty acid synthase and a chalcone synthase. We report here that <i>D. discoideum</i> further increases its polyketide potential by using the StlB Steely enzyme, and a downstream chlorinating enzyme, to make both a chlorinated signal molecule, DIF-1, during its multi-cellular development, and a set of abundant polyketides in terminally differentiated stalk cells. We identify one of these as a chlorinated dibenzofuran with potent anti-bacterial activity. To do this, StlB switches expression from prespore to stalk cells in late development and is cleaved to release the chalcone synthase domain. Expression of this domain alone in StlB null cells allows synthesis of the stalk-associated, chlorinated polyketides. Thus, by altered expression and processing of StlB, cells make first a signal molecule, and then abundant secondary metabolites, which we speculate help to protect the mature spores from bacterial infection.",

        "abstract": "The superfamily of 3'-5' polymerases synthesize RNA in the opposite direction to all other DNA/RNA polymerases, and its members include eukaryotic tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase (Thg1), as well as Thg1-like proteins (TLPs) of unknown function that are broadly distributed, with family members in all three domains of life. Dictyostelium discoideum encodes one Thg1 and three TLPs (DdiTLP2, DdiTLP3 and DdiTLP4). Here, we demonstrate that depletion of each of the genes results in a significant growth defect, and that each protein catalyzes a unique biological reaction, taking advantage of specialized biochemical properties. DdiTLP2 catalyzes a mitochondria-specific tRNA(His) maturation reaction, which is distinct from the tRNA(His) maturation reaction typically catalyzed by Thg1 enzymes on cytosolic tRNA. DdiTLP3 catalyzes tRNA repair during mitochondrial tRNA 5'-editing in vivo and in vitro, establishing template-dependent 3'-5' polymerase activity of TLPs as a bona fide biological activity for the first time since its unexpected discovery more than a decade ago. DdiTLP4 is cytosolic and, surprisingly, catalyzes robust 3'-5' polymerase activity on non-tRNA substrates, strongly implying further roles for TLP 3'-5' polymerases in eukaryotes.",

In general, it consists of a hydrophobic core of triglycerides and steryl esters surrounded by only one leaflet derived from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to which a specific set of proteins is bound. We have chosen the unicellular organism Dictyostelium discoideum to establish kinetics of lipid droplet formation and degradation and to further identify the lipid constituents and proteins of lipid droplets. Here, we show that the lipid composition is similar to what is found in mammalian lipid droplets. In addition, phospholipids preferentially consist of mainly saturated fatty acids, whereas neutral lipids are enriched in unsaturated fatty acids. Among the novel protein components are LdpA, a protein specific to Dictyostelium, and Net4, which has strong homologies to mammalian DUF829/Tmem53/NET4 that was previously only known as a constituent of the mammalian nuclear envelope. The proteins analyzed so far appear to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lipid droplets, supporting the concept that lipid droplets are formed on this membrane.",

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and amitochondriate pathogen Entamoeba histolytica are the first Amoebozoa with genomes completely sequenced. Both organisms are classified under the Conosa subphylum. To identify Amoebozoa-specific genomic elements, we compared these two genomes to each other and to other eukaryotic genomes. An expanded phylogenetic tree built from the complete predicted proteomes of 23 eukaryotes places the two amoebae in the same lineage, although the divergence is estimated to be greater than that between animals and fungi, and probably happened shortly after the Amoebozoa split from the opisthokont lineage. Most of the 1,500 orthologous gene families shared between the two amoebae are also shared with plant, animal, and fungal genomes. We found that only 42 gene families are distinct to the amoeba lineage; among these are a large number of proteins that contain repeats of the FNIP domain, and a putative transcription factor essential for proper cell type differentiation in D. discoideum. These Amoebozoa-specific genes may be useful in the design of novel diagnostics and therapies for amoebal pathologies.",

        "abstract": "The histidine kinase DhkC controls a phosphorelay involved in regulating the slug versus culmination choice during the multicellular developmental program of Dictyostelium discoideum. When the relay is active, slug migration is favored due to the activation of a cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and the resultant lowering of the intracellular and extracellular levels of cAMP. Ammonia signaling represents one input into the DhkC phosphorelay, and previous studies indicated that the ammonium transporter C inhibits the relay in response to low ammonia levels. Evidence is presented that another member of the family of ammonium transporters, AmtA, also regulates the slug/culmination choice. Under standard conditions of development, the wild-type strain requires a transitional period of 2 to 3 h to go from fingers to culminants, with some slugs forming and migrating briefly prior to culmination. In contrast, amtA null cells, like cells that lack DhkC, possessed a transitional period of only 1 to 2 h and rarely formed slugs. Disruption of amtA in an amtC null strain overcame the slugger phenotype of that strain and restored its ability to culminate. Strains lacking AmtA were insensitive to the ability of ammonia to promote and prolong slug migration. These findings lead to the proposal that AmtA functions in ammonia sensing as an activator of the DhkC phosphorelay in response to perceived high ammonia levels.",

Here we report that cell death in the single-celled organism Dictyostelium discoideum involves early disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) that precedes the induction of several apoptosis-like features, including exposure of the phosphatidyl residues at the external surface of the plasma membrane, an intense vacuolization, a fragmentation of DNA into large fragments, an autophagy, and the release of apoptotic corpses that are engulfed by neighboring cells. We have cloned a Dictyostelium homolog of mammalian AIF that is localized into mitochondria and is translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and the nucleus after the onset of cell death. Cytoplasmic extracts from dying Dictyostelium cells trigger the breakdown of isolated mammalian and Dictyostelium nuclei in a cell-free system, and this process is inhibited by a polyclonal antibody specific for Dictyostelium discoideum apoptosis-inducing factor (DdAIF), suggesting that DdAIF is involved in DNA degradation during Dictyostelium cell death. Our findings indicate that the cell death pathway in Dictyostelium involves mitochondria and an AIF homolog, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of at least part of the cell death pathway in unicellular and multicellular organisms.",

Phagocytosed particles are delivered via a complex route from phagosomes to lysosomes for degradation, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the phagosome maturation process are not well understood. Here, we identify a novel vesicle-associated receptor tyrosine kinase-like protein, VSK3, in D. discoideum. We demonstrate how VSK3 is involved in phagosome maturation. VSK3 resides on the membrane of late endosomes/lysosomes with its C-terminal kinase domain facing the cytoplasm. Inactivation of VSK3 by gene disruption reduces the rate of phagocytosis in cells, which is rescued by re-expression of VSK3. We found that the in vivo function of VSK3 depends on the presence of the kinase domain and vesicle localization. Furthermore, VSK3 is not essential for engulfment, but instead, is required for the fusion of phagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes. Our findings suggest that localized tyrosine kinase signaling on the surface of endosome/lysosomes represents a control mechanism for phagosome maturation.",

        "abstract": "To many pathogenic bacteria, human hosts are an evolutionary dead end. This begs the question what evolutionary forces have shaped their virulence traits. Why are these bacteria so virulent? The coincidental evolution hypothesis suggests that such virulence factors result from adaptation to other ecological niches. In particular, virulence traits in bacteria might result from selective pressure exerted by protozoan predator. Thus, grazing resistance may be an evolutionarily exaptation for bacterial pathogenicity. This hypothesis was tested by subjecting a well characterized collection of 31 Escherichia coli strains (human commensal or extra-intestinal pathogenic) to grazing by the social haploid amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We then assessed how resistance to grazing correlates with some bacterial traits, such as the presence of virulence genes. Whatever the relative population size (bacteria/amoeba) for a non-pathogenic bacteria strain, D. discoideum was able to phagocytise, digest and grow. In contrast, a pathogenic bacterium strain killed D. discoideum above a certain bacteria/amoeba population size. A plating assay was then carried out using the E. coli collection faced to the grazing of D. discoideum. E. coli strains carrying virulence genes such as iroN, irp2, fyuA involved in iron uptake, belonging to the B2 phylogenetic group and being virulent in a mouse model of septicaemia were resistant to the grazing from D. discoideum. Experimental proof of the key role of the irp gene in the grazing resistance was evidenced with a mutant strain lacking this gene. Such determinant of virulence may well be originally selected and (or) further maintained for their role in natural habitat: resistance to digestion by free-living protozoa, rather than for virulence per se.",

As cysts, pathogenic amoebas resist antibiotics, which particularly counteracts treatment of vision-destroying Acanthamoeba keratitis. Limited genetic tractability of amoeba pathogens has left their encystation mechanisms unexplored. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum forms spores in multicellular fruiting bodies to survive starvation, while other dictyostelids, such as Polysphondylium pallidum can additionally encyst as single cells. Sporulation is induced by cAMP acting on PKA, with the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA critically regulating cAMP levels. We show here that RegA is deeply conserved in social and pathogenic amoebas and that deletion of the RegA gene in P. pallidum causes precocious encystation and prevents cyst germination. We heterologously expressed and characterized Acanthamoeba RegA and performed a compound screen to identify RegA inhibitors. Two effective inhibitors increased cAMP levels and triggered Acanthamoeba encystation. Our results show that RegA critically regulates Amoebozoan encystation and that components of the cAMP signalling pathway could be effective targets for therapeutic intervention with encystation.",

The interpretation of results often rests on the premise that cell responses result from cell dehydration, i.e. osmotic effects. The results of induced hypertonicity on cell movement of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae and human melanoma HTB-140 cells reported here show that: i) hypertonic solutions of identical osmolarity will either inhibit or stimulate cell movement depending on specific solutes (Na(+) or K(+), sorbitol or saccharose); ii) inhibition of cell motility by hypertonic solutions containing Na(+) ions or carbohydrates can be reversed by the addition of calcium ions; iii) various cell types react differently to the same solutions, and iv) cells can adapt to hypertonic solutions. Various hypertonic solutions are now broadly used in medicine and to study modulation of gene expression. The observations reported suggest the need to examine whether the other responses of cells to hypertonicity can also be based on the solute-dependent cell responses besides cell dehydration due to the osmotic effects.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of sociality and altruism is enigmatic because cooperators are constantly threatened by cheaters who benefit from cooperation without incurring its full cost [1, 2]. Kin recognition is the ability to recognize and cooperate with genetically close relatives. It has also been proposed as a potential mechanism that limits cheating [3, 4], but there has been no direct experimental support for that possibility. Here we show that kin recognition protects cooperators against cheaters. The social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum cooperate by forming multicellular aggregates that develop into fruiting bodies of viable spores and dead stalk cells. Cheaters preferentially differentiate into spores while their victims die as stalk cells in chimeric aggregates. We engineered syngeneic cheaters and victims that differed only in their kin-recognition genes, tgrB1 and tgrC1, and in a single cheater allele and found that the victims escaped exploitation by different types of nonkin cheaters. This protection depends on kin-recognition-mediated segregation because it is compromised when we disrupt strain segregation. These findings provide direct evidence for the role of kin recognition in cheater control and suggest a mechanism for the maintenance of stable cooperative systems.",

Here, using interaction genetics, we report the first characterization of a novel protein, enlazin. Enlazin is a natural fusion of two canonical classes of actin-associated proteins, the ezrin-radixin-moesin family and fimbrin, and it is localized to actin-rich structures. A fragment of enlazin, enl-tr, was isolated as a genetic suppressor of the cytokinesis defect of cortexillin-I mutants. Expression of enl-tr disrupts expression of endogenous enlazin, indicating that enl-tr functions as a dominant-negative lesion. Enlazin is distributed globally during cytokinesis and is required for cortical tension and cell adhesion. Consistent with a role in cell mechanics, inhibition of enlazin in a cortexillin-I background restores cytokinesis furrowing dynamics and suppresses the growth-in-suspension defect. However, as expected for a role in cell adhesion, inhibiting enlazin in a myosin-II background induces a synthetic cytokinesis phenotype, frequently arresting furrow ingression at the dumbbell shape and/or causing recession of the furrow. Thus, enlazin has roles in cell mechanics and adhesion, and these roles seem to be differentially significant for cytokinesis, depending on the genetic background.",

To better characterize MAPK regulation, the levels of phosphorylated MAPKs were analyzed in response to external signals. Only ERK2 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to the chemoattractants, cAMP and folate. In contrast, the phosphorylation of ERK1 occurred as a secondary or indirect response to these stimuli and this phosphorylation was enhanced by cell-cell interactions, suggesting that other external signals can activate ERK1. The phosphorylation of ERK1 or ERK2 did not require the function of the other MAPK in these responses. Folate stimulation of a chimeric population of erk1- and g\u03b14- cells revealed that the phosphorylation of ERK1 could be mediated through an intercellular signal other than folate. Loss of ERK1 function suppressed the developmental delay and the deficiency in anterior cell localization associated with g\u03b15- mutants suggesting that ERK1 function can be down regulated through G\u03b15 subunit-mediated signaling. However, no major changes in the phosphorylation of ERK1 were observed in g\u03b15- cells suggesting that the G\u03b15 subunit signaling pathway does not regulate the phosphorylation of ERK1. These findings suggest that the activation of ERK1 occurs as a secondary response to chemoattractants and that other cell-cell signaling mechanisms contribute to this activation. G\u03b15 subunit signaling can down regulate ERK1 function to promote prestalk cell development but not through major changes to the level of phosphorylated ERK1.",

        "abstract": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a calcium-activated calcium channel critical for signaling and bioenergetics. MCU, the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter, contains two transmembrane domains and is found in all major eukaryotic taxa. In amoeba and fungi, MCU homologs are sufficient to form a functional calcium channel, whereas human MCU exhibits a strict requirement for the metazoan protein essential MCU regulator (EMRE) for conductance. Here, we exploit this evolutionary divergence to decipher the molecular basis of human MCU's dependence on EMRE. By systematically generating chimeric proteins that consist of EMRE-independent <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> MCU and <i>Homo sapiens</i> MCU (HsMCU), we converged on a stretch of 10 amino acids in <i>D. discoideum</i> MCU that can be transplanted to HsMCU to render it EMRE independent. We call this region in human MCU the EMRE dependence domain (EDD). Crosslinking experiments show that EMRE directly interacts with HsMCU at its transmembrane domains as well as the EDD. Our results suggest that EMRE stabilizes the EDD of MCU, permitting both channel opening and calcium conductance, consistent with recently published structures of MCU-EMRE.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is a genetically and biochemically tractable social amoeba belonging to the crown group of eukaryotes. It performs some of the tasks characteristic of a leukocyte such as chemotactic motility, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis that are not performed by other model organisms or are difficult to study. D. discoideum is becoming a popular system to study molecular mechanisms of endocytosis, but the morphological characterization of the organelles along this pathway and the comparison with equivalent and/or different organelles in animal cells and yeasts were lagging. Herein, we used a combination of evanescent wave microscopy and electron microscopy of rapidly frozen samples to visualize primary endocytic vesicles, vesicular-tubular structures of the early and late endo-lysosomal system, such as multivesicular bodies, and the specialized secretory lysosomes. In addition, we present biochemical and morphological evidence for the existence of a micropinocytic pathway, which contributes to the uptake of membrane along side macropinocytosis, which is the major fluid phase uptake process. This complex endosomal compartment underwent continuous cycles of tubulation/vesiculation as well as homo- and heterotypic fusions, in a way reminiscent of mechanisms and structures documented in leukocytes. Finally, egestion of fluid phase from the secretory lysosomes was directly observed.",

        "title": "Diversity and Functional Evolution of Terpene Synthases in Dictyostelid Social Amoebae.",
        "abstract": "Dictyostelids, or social amoebae, have a unique life style in forming multicellular fruiting bodies from unicellular amoeboids upon starvation. Recently, dictyostelids were found to contain terpene synthase (TPS) genes, a gene type of secondary metabolism previously known to occur only in plants, fungi and bacteria. Here we report an evolutionary functional study of dictyostelid TPS genes. The number of TPS genes in six species of dictyostelids examined ranges from 1 to 19; and the model species Dictyostelium purpureum contains 12 genes. Using in vitro enzyme assays, the 12 TPS genes from D. purpureum were shown to encode functional enzymes with distinct product profiles. The expression of the 12 TPS genes in D. purpureum is developmentally regulated. During multicellular development, D. purpureum releases a mixture of volatile terpenes dominated by sesquiterpenes that are the in vitro products of a subset of the 12 TPS genes. The quality and quantity of the terpenes released from D. purpureum, however, bear little resemblance to those of D. discoideum, a closely related dictyostelid. Despite these variations, the conserved clade of dictyostelid TPSs, which have an evolutionary distance of more than 600 million years, has the same biochemical function, catalyzing the formation of a sesquiterpene protoillud-7-ene. Taken together, our results indicate that the dynamic evolution of dictyostelid TPS genes includes both purifying selection of an orthologous group and species-specific expansion with functional divergence. Consequently, the terpenes produced by these TPSs most likely have conserved as well as species-adaptive biological functions as chemical languages in dictyostelids.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) are a class of MAP kinases that function in many signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells and in some cases, a single stimulus can activate more than one ERK suggesting functional redundancy or divergence from a common pathway. Dictyostelium discoideum encodes only two MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, that both function during the developmental life cycle. To determine if ERK1 and ERK2 have overlapping functions, chemotactic and developmental phenotypes of erk1(-) and erk2(-) mutants were assessed with respect to G protein-mediated signal transduction pathways. ERK1 was specifically required for Galpha5-mediated tip morphogenesis and inhibition of folate chemotaxis but not for cAMP-stimulated chemotaxis or cGMP accumulation. ERK2 was the primary MAPK phosphorylated in response to folate or cAMP stimulation. Cell growth was not altered in erk1(-), erk2(-) or erk1(-)erk2(-) mutants but each mutant displayed a different pattern of cell sorting in chimeric aggregates. The distribution of GFP-ERK1 or GFP-ERK2 fusion proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus was not grossly altered in cells stimulated with cAMP or folate. These results suggest ERK1 and ERK2 have different roles in G protein-mediated signaling during growth and development.",

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium</i> cells undergo a semi-closed mitosis, during which the nuclear envelope (NE) persists; however, free diffusion between the cytoplasm and the nucleus takes place. To permit the formation of the mitotic spindle, the nuclear envelope must be permeabilized in order to allow diffusion of tubulin dimers and spindle assembly factors into the nucleus. In Aspergillus, free diffusion of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is achieved by a partial disassembly of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) prior to spindle assembly. In order to determine whether this is also the case in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, we analysed components of the NPC by immunofluorescence microscopy and live cell imaging and studied their behaviour during interphase and mitosis. We observed that the NPCs are absent from the contact area of the nucleoli and that some nucleoporins also localize to the centrosome and the spindle poles. In addition, we could show that, during mitosis, the central FG protein NUP62, two inner ring components and Gle1 depart from the NPCs, while all other tested NUPs remained at the NE. This leads to the conclusion that indeed a partial disassembly of the NPCs takes place, which contributes to permeabilisation of the NE during semi-closed mitosis.",

Here we revealed that the dynamics of cAMP-mediated signaling showed a transition from propagating waves to steady state during cell development. Live-cell imaging of cytosolic cAMP levels revealed that their oscillation and propagation in cell populations were obvious for cell aggregation and mound formation stages, but they gradually disappeared when multicellular slugs started to migrate. A similar transition of signaling dynamics occurred with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate signaling, which is upstream of the cAMP signal pathway. This transition was programmed with concomitant developmental progression. We propose a new model in which cAMP oscillation and propagation between cells, which are important at the unicellular stage, are unessential for collective cell migration at the multicellular stage.",

In addition, chemotactic signals can be amplified and relayed to proximal cells via the synthesis and secretion of additional chemoattractant. The mechanisms underlying such remarkable features remain ill defined. We show that the asymmetrical distribution of adenylyl cyclase (ACA) at the back of Dictyostelium discoideum cells, an essential determinant of their ability to migrate in a head-to-tail fashion, requires vesicular trafficking. This trafficking results in a local accumulation of ACA-containing intracellular vesicles and involves intact actin, microtubule networks, and de novo protein synthesis. We also show that migrating cells leave behind ACA-containing vesicles, likely secreted as multivesicular bodies and presumably involved in the formation of head-to-tail arrays of migrating cells. We propose that similar compartmentalization and shedding mechanisms exist in mammalian cells during embryogenesis, wound healing, neuron growth, and metastasis.",

However, this simple, ubiquitous molecule remains poorly understood. The use of nonstandardized analytical methods has contributed to this lack of clarity. By using improved polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we were able to visualize polyP extracted from Dictyostelium discoideum. We established that polyP is undetectable in cells lacking the polyphosphate kinase (DdPpk1). Generation of this ppk1 null strain revealed that polyP is important for the general fitness of the amoebae with the mutant strain displaying a substantial growth defect. We discovered an unprecedented accumulation of polyP during the developmental program, with polyP increasing more than 100-fold. The failure of ppk1 spores to accumulate polyP results in a germination defect. These phenotypes are underpinned by the ability of polyP to regulate basic energetic metabolism, demonstrated by a 2.5-fold decrease in the level of ATP in vegetative ppk1. Finally, the lack of polyP during the development of ppk1 mutant cells is partially offset by an increase of both ATP and inositol pyrophosphates, evidence for a model in which there is a functional interplay between inositol pyrophosphates, ATP, and polyP.",

        "abstract": "Directional cell migration and the establishment of polarity play an important role in development, wound healing, and host cell defense. While actin polymerization provides the driving force at the cell front, the microtubule network assumes a regulatory function, in coordinating front protrusion and rear retraction. By using <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells as a model for amoeboid movement in different 2D and 3D environments, the position of the centrosome relative to the nucleus was analyzed using live-cell microscopy. Our results showed that the centrosome was preferentially located rearward of the nucleus under all conditions tested for directed migration, while the nucleus was oriented toward the expanding front. When cells are hindered from straight movement by obstacles, the centrosome is displaced temporarily from its rearward location to the side of the nucleus, but is reoriented within seconds. This relocalization is supported by the presence of intact microtubules and their contact with the cortex. The data suggest that the centrosome is responsible for coordinating microtubules with respect to the nucleus. In summary, we have analyzed the orientation of the centrosome during different modes of migration in an amoeboid model and present evidence that the basic principles of centrosome positioning and movement are conserved between <i>Dictyostelium</i> and human leukocytes.",

Here, we have shown the optogenetic modulation of the cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) gene expression and their downstream effector molecule (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in HEK-293T cells and the development process of Dictyostelium discoideum via modulating the cyclic nucleotide (cAMP) signaling pathway utilizing photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) as an optogenetic tool. Light-induced activation of PACs in HEK-293T cells increases the cAMP level that leads to activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor and further upregulates downstream Cox-2 gene expression and their downstream effector molecule prostaglandin E2. In D. discoideum, the light-regulated increase in cAMP level affects the starvation-induced developmental process. These PACs could modulate the cAMP levels in a light-dependent manner and have a potential to control gene expression and their downstream effector molecules with varying magnitude. It would enable one to utilize PAC as a tool to decipher cyclic nucleotide mediated signaling pathway regulations and their mechanism.",

We identified DdNKAP, the Dictyostelium discoideum ortholog of mammalian NKAP, as interacting partner of the nuclear envelope protein SUN-1. DdNKAP harbors a number of basic RDR/RDRS repeats in its N-terminal domain and the SynMuv/DUF926 domain at its C-terminus. We describe a novel and direct interaction between DdNKAP and Prp19 (Pre mRNA processing factor 19) which might be relevant for the observed DdNKAP ubiquitination. Genome wide analysis using cross-linking immunoprecipitation-high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) revealed DdNKAP association with intergenic regions, exons, introns and non-coding RNAs. Ectopic expression of DdNKAP and its domains affects several developmental aspects like stream formation, aggregation, and chemotaxis. We conclude that DdNKAP is a multifunctional protein, which might influence Dictyostelium development through its interaction with RNA and RNA binding proteins. Mutants overexpressing full length DdNKAP and the N-terminal domain alone (DdN-NKAP) showed opposite phenotypes in development and opposite expression profiles of several genes and rRNAs.

A related process, the expulsion of the lethal endosomal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans from mammalian macrophages, also uses WASH-coated vesicles, and cells expressing dominant negative WASH mutants inefficiently expel C. neoformans. D. discoideum WASH causes filamentous actin (F-actin) patches to form on lysosomes, leading to the removal of vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) and the neutralization of lysosomes to form postlysosomes. Without WASH, no patches or coats are formed, neutral postlysosomes are not seen, and indigestible material such as dextran is not exocytosed. Similar results occur when actin polymerization is blocked with latrunculin. V-ATPases are known to bind avidly to F-actin.

Surprisingly, very little is known about its mechanisms of cellular uptake. Here, we employ a range of cellular, molecular and genetic approaches to characterize VPA uptake using a simple biomedical model, Dictyostelium discoideum. We show that VPA is taken up against an electrochemical gradient in a dose-dependent manner. Transport is protein-mediated, dependent on pH and the proton gradient and shows strong substrate structure specificity. Using a genetic screen, we identified a protein homologous to a mammalian solute carrier family 4 (SLC4) bicarbonate transporter that we show is involved in VPA uptake. Pharmacological and genetic ablation of this protein reduces the uptake of VPA and partially protects against VPA-dependent developmental effects, and extracellular bicarbonate competes for VPA uptake in Dictyostelium. We further show that this uptake mechanism is likely to be conserved in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus laevis model systems. These results implicate, for the first time, an uptake mechanism for VPA through SLC4-catalysed activity.",

Putative G4-forming sequences (G4FS) have been reported in humans, yeast, bacteria, viruses and many organisms. Here we present the first mapping of G-quadruplex sequences in Dictyostelium discoideum, the social amoeba. 'Dicty' is an ameboid protozoan with a small (34 Mb) and extremely AT rich genome (78%). As a consequence, very few G4-prone motifs are expected. An in silico analysis of the Dictyostelium genome with the G4Hunter software detected 249-1055 G4-prone motifs, depending on G4Hunter chosen threshold. Interestingly, despite an even lower GC content (as compared to the whole Dicty genome), the density of G4 motifs in Dictyostelium promoters and introns is significantly higher than in the rest of the genome. Fourteen selected sequences located in important genes were characterized by a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Our data show that these sequences form highly stable G4 structures under physiological conditions. Five Dictyostelium genes containing G4-prone motifs in their promoters were studied for the effect of a new G4-binding porphyrin derivative on their expression. Our results demonstrated that the new ligand significantly decreased their expression. Overall, our results constitute the first step to adopt Dictyostelium discoideum as a 'G4-poor' model for studies on G-quadruplexes.",

        "abstract": "Aurora kinases are highly conserved proteins with important roles in mitosis. Metazoans contain two kinases, Aurora A and B, which contribute distinct functions at the spindle poles and the equatorial region respectively. It is not currently known whether the specialized functions of the two kinases arose after their duplication in animal cells or were already present in their ancestral kinase. We show that Dictyostelium discoideum contains a single Aurora kinase, DdAurora, that displays characteristics of both Aurora A and B. Like Aurora A, DdAurora has an extended N-terminal domain with an A-box sequence and localizes at the spindle poles during early mitosis. Like Aurora B, DdAurora binds to its partner DdINCENP and localizes on centromeres at metaphase, the central spindle during anaphase, and the cleavage furrow at the end of cytokinesis. DdAurora also has several unusual properties. DdAurora remains associated with centromeres in anaphase, and this association does not require an interaction with DdINCENP. DdAurora then localizes at the cleavage furrow, but only at the end of cytokinesis. This localization is dependent on DdINCENP and the motor proteins Kif12 and myosin II. Thus, DdAurora may represent the ancestral kinase that gave rise to the different Aurora kinases in animals and also those in other organisms.",

        "abstract": "Amoeboid cell motility is essential for a wide range of biological processes including wound healing, embryonic morphogenesis, and cancer metastasis. It relies on complex dynamical patterns of cell shape changes that pose long-standing challenges to mathematical modeling and raise a need for automated and reproducible approaches to extract quantitative morphological features from image sequences. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework and a computational method for obtaining smooth representations of the spatiotemporal contour dynamics from stacks of segmented microscopy images. Based on a Gaussian process regression we propose a one-parameter family of regularized contour flows that allows us to continuously track reference points (virtual markers) between successive cell contours. We use this approach to define a coordinate system on the moving cell boundary and to represent different local geometric quantities in this frame of reference. In particular, we introduce the local marker dispersion as a measure to identify localized membrane expansions and provide a fully automated way to extract the properties of such expansions, including their area and growth time. The methods are available as an open-source software package called AmoePy, a Python-based toolbox for analyzing amoeboid cell motility (based on time-lapse microscopy data), including a graphical user interface and detailed documentation. Due to the mathematical rigor of our framework, we envision it to be of use for the development of novel cell motility models. We mainly use experimental data of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum to illustrate and validate our approach.",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotic cells, including Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, fibroblasts, and neutrophils, are able to respond to chemoattractant gradients with high sensitivity. Recent studies have demonstrated that, after the introduction of a chemoattractant gradient, several chemotaxis pathway components exhibit a subcellular reorganization that cannot be described as a simple amplification of the external gradient. Instead, this reorganization has the characteristics of a switch, leading to a well defined front and back. Here, we propose a directional sensing mechanism in which two second messengers are produced at equal rates. The diffusion of one of them, coupled with an inactivation scheme, ensures a switch-like response to external gradients for a large range of gradient steepness and average concentration. Furthermore, our model is able to reverse the subcellular organization rapidly, and its response to multiple simultaneous chemoattractant sources is in good agreement with recent experimental results. Finally, we propose that the dynamics of a heterotrimeric G protein might allow for a specific biochemical realization of our model.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum shows chemotaxis towards folic acid (FA) throughout vegetative growth, and towards cAMP during development. We determined the spatiotemporal localization of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules and investigated the FA-mediated responses in a number of signaling mutants to further our understanding of the core regulatory elements that are crucial for cell migration. Proteins enriched in the pseudopods during chemotaxis also relocalize transiently to the plasma membrane during uniform FA stimulation. In contrast, proteins that are absent from the pseudopods during migration redistribute transiently from the PM to the cytosol when cells are globally stimulated with FA. These chemotactic responses to FA were also examined in cells lacking the GTPases Ras C and G. Although Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity were significantly decreased in Ras G and Ras C/G nulls, these mutants still migrated towards FA, indicating that other pathways must support FA-mediated chemotaxis. We also examined the spatial movements of PTEN in response to uniform FA and cAMP stimulation in phospholipase C (PLC) null cells. The lack of PLC strongly influences the localization of PTEN in response to FA, but not cAMP. In addition, we compared the gradient-sensing behavior of polarized cells migrating towards cAMP to that of unpolarized cells migrating towards FA. The majority of polarized cells make U-turns when the cAMP gradient is switched from the front of the cell to the rear. Conversely, unpolarized cells immediately extend pseudopods towards the new FA source. We also observed that plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] levels oscillate in unpolarized cells treated with Latrunculin-A, whereas polarized cells had stable plasma membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 responses toward the chemoattractant gradient source. Results were similar for cells that were starved for 4 hours, with a mixture of polarized and unpolarized cells responding to cAMP. Taken together, these findings suggest that similar components control gradient sensing during FA- and cAMP-mediated motility, but the response of polarized cells is more stable, which ultimately helps maintain their directionality.",

        "abstract": "Neutrophils and dendritic cells when migrating in confined environments have been shown to actuate a directional choice toward paths of least hydraulic resistance (barotaxis), in some cases overriding chemotactic responses. Here, we investigate whether this barotactic response is conserved in the more primitive model organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> using a microfluidic chip design. This design allowed us to monitor the behavior of single cells via live imaging when confronted with bifurcating microchannels, presenting different combinations of hydraulic and chemical stimuli. Under the conditions employed we find no evidence in support of a barotactic response; the cells base their directional choices on the chemotactic cues. When the cells are confronted by a microchannel bifurcation, they often split their leading edge and start moving into both channels, before a decision is made to move into one and retract from the other channel. Analysis of this decision-making process has shown that cells in steeper nonhydrolyzable adenosine- 3', 5'- cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp- isomer (cAMPS) gradients move faster and split more readily. Furthermore, there exists a highly significant strong correlation between the velocity of the pseudopod moving up the cAMPS gradient to the total velocity of the pseudopods moving up and down the gradient over a large range of velocities. This suggests a role for a critical cortical tension gradient in the directional decision-making process.",

The association between Burkholderia bacteria and the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a tractable model to unravel the biology underlying symbiont-endowed phenotypes and their impacts. Several Burkholderia species stably associate with D. discoideum and typically reduce host fitness in food-rich environments while increasing fitness in food-scarce environments. Burkholderia symbionts are themselves inedible to their hosts but induce co-infections with secondary bacteria that can serve as a food source. Thus, Burkholderia hosts are \"farmers\" that carry food bacteria to new environments, providing a benefit when food is scarce. We examined the ability of specific Burkholderia genotypes to induce secondary co-infections and assessed host fitness under a range of co-infection conditions and environmental contexts. Although all Burkholderia symbionts intracellularly infected Dictyostelium, we found that co-infections are predominantly extracellular, suggesting that farming benefits are derived from extracellular infection of host structures. Furthermore, levels of secondary infection are linked to conditional host fitness; B. agricolaris infected hosts have the highest level of co-infection and have the highest fitness in food-scarce environments. This study illuminates the phenomenon of co-infection induction across Dictyostelium associated Burkholderia species and exemplifies the contextual complexity of these associations.",

The interaction occurs through the actin binding domain of Filamin and the GRD domain of GAPA. A similar interaction takes place with Cortexillin I. We further report that Filamin associates with Rac1a implying that filamin might act as a scaffold for small GTPases. Filamin and activated Rac associate with GAPA to regulate actin remodelling. Overexpression of filamin and GAPA in the various strains suggests that GAPA regulates the actin cytoskeleton through interaction with Filamin and that it controls cytokinesis through association with Filamin and Cortexillin.",

        "abstract": "Control of chromatin structure is crucial for multicellular development and regulation of cell differentiation. The CHD (chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding) protein family is one of the major ATP-dependent, chromatin remodeling factors that regulate nucleosome positioning and access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to the eukaryotic genome. There are three mammalian CHD subfamilies and their impaired functions are associated with several human diseases. Here, we identify three CHD orthologs (ChdA, ChdB and ChdC) in Dictyostelium discoideum. These CHDs are expressed throughout development, but with unique patterns. Null mutants lacking each CHD have distinct phenotypes that reflect their expression patterns and suggest functional specificity. Accordingly, using genome-wide (RNA-seq) transcriptome profiling for each null strain, we show that the different CHDs regulate distinct gene sets during both growth and development. ChdC is an apparent ortholog of the mammalian Class III CHD group that is associated with the human CHARGE syndrome, and GO analyses of aberrant gene expression in chdC nulls suggest defects in both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous signaling, which have been confirmed through analyses of chdC nulls developed in pure populations or with low levels of wild-type cells. This study provides novel insight into the broad function of CHDs in the regulation development and disease, through chromatin-mediated changes in directed gene expression.",

We show that expressing activated Ras GTPase-family proteins in cells lacking PTEN or other mutations which increase cellular protrusiveness transforms cells into a persistently activated state. Leading- and trailing-edge markers were found exclusively at the cell perimeter and the cytosol, respectively, of the dramatically flattened cells. In addition, the lifetimes of dynamic actin puncta were increased where they overlapped with actin waves, suggesting a mechanism for the coupling between these two networks. All of these phenotypes could be reversed by inhibiting signal transduction. Strikingly, maintaining cells in this state of constant activation led to a form of cell death by catastrophic fragmentation. These findings provide insight into the feedback loops that control excitability of the signal transduction network, which drives migration.",

Dictyostelium discoideum contains an extensive family of Ras proteins that function in regulation of mitosis, cytoskeletal function and motility, and the onset of development. Little is known about the events that lead to the activation of Ras proteins in Dictyostelium, primarily owing to a lack of a biochemical assay to measure the levels of activated Ras. We have adapted an assay, used successfully to measure activated Ras in mammalian cells, to monitor activation of two Dictyostelium Ras proteins, RasC and RasG. We have found that the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of mammalian Raf1 was capable of binding to the activated form of RasG, but not to the activated form of RasC; however, the RBD of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Byr2 was capable of binding preferentially to the activated forms of both RasC and RasG. Using this assay, we discovered that RasC and RasG showed a rapid and transient activation when aggregation-competent cells were stimulated with the chemoattractant cAMP, and this activation did not occur in a number of cAMP signalling mutants. These data provide further evidence of a role for both RasC and RasG in the early development of Dictyostelium.",

Here, we describe the phenotypes of Dictyostelium discoideum ATG16(-) and ATG9(-)/16(-) cells and compare them to the previously reported ATG9(-) mutant. ATG16 deficiency caused an increase in the expression of several core autophagy genes, among them atg9 and the two atg8 paralogues. The single and double ATG9 and ATG16 knock-out mutants had complex phenotypes and displayed severe and comparable defects in pinocytosis and phagocytosis. Uptake of Legionella pneumophila was reduced. In addition, ATG9(-) and ATG16(-) cells had dramatic defects in autophagy, development and proteasomal activity which were much more severe in the ATG9(-)/16(-) double mutant. Mutant cells showed an increase in poly-ubiquitinated proteins and contained large ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates which partially co-localized with ATG16-GFP in ATG9(-)/16(-) cells. The more severe autophagic, developmental and proteasomal phenotypes of ATG9(-)/16(-) cells imply that ATG9 and ATG16 probably function in parallel in autophagy and have in addition autophagy-independent functions in further cellular processes.",

After binding to bone mineral, they are taken up selectively by the osteoclasts and inhibit the essential enzyme FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase). NBPs inhibit also growth of amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum in which their target is again FDPS. A fusion protein between FDPS and GFP (green fluorescent protein) was found, in D. discoideum, to localize to peroxisomes and to confer resistance to the NBP alendronate. GFP was also directed to peroxisomes by a fragment of FDPS comprising amino acids 1-22. This contains a sequence of nine amino acids that closely resembles the nonapeptide PTS2 (peroxisomal targeting signal type\u00a02): there is only a single amino acid mismatch between the two sequences. Mutation analysis confirmed that the atypical PTS2 directs FDPS into peroxisomes. Furthermore, expression of the D. discoideum FDPS-GFP fusion protein in strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in peroxisomal protein import demonstrated that import of FDPS into peroxisomes was blocked in a strain lacking the PTS2-dependent import pathway. The peroxisomal location of FDPS in D. discoideum indicates that NBPs have to cross the peroxisomal membrane before they can bind to their target.",

        "abstract": "Unicellular organisms exhibit elaborate collective behaviors in response to environmental cues. These behaviors are controlled by complex biochemical networks within individual cells and coordinated through cell-to-cell communication. Describing these behaviors requires new mathematical models that can bridge scales-from biochemical networks within individual cells to spatially structured cellular populations. Here we present a family of \"multiscale\" models for the emergence of spiral waves in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Our models exploit new experimental advances that allow for the direct measurement and manipulation of the small signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) used by Dictyostelium cells to coordinate behavior in cellular populations. Inspired by recent experiments, we model the Dictyostelium signaling network as an excitable system coupled to various preprocessing modules. We use this family of models to study spatially unstructured populations of \"fixed\" cells by constructing phase diagrams that relate the properties of population-level oscillations to parameters in the underlying biochemical network. We then briefly discuss an extension of our model that includes spatial structure and show how this naturally gives rise to spiral waves. Our models exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena. including a density-dependent frequency change, bistability, and dynamic death due to slow cAMP dynamics. Our modeling approach provides a powerful tool for bridging scales in modeling of Dictyostelium populations.",

        "abstract": "To investigate protein import into the mitochondria of Dictyostelium discoideum, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused as a reporter protein either to variable lengths of the N-terminal region of chaperonin 60 (the first 23, 40, 80, 97, and 150 amino acids) or to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of DNA topoisomerase II. The fusion proteins were expressed in AX2 cells under the actin-15 promoter. Fluorescence images of GFP transformants confirmed that Dictyostelium chaperonin 60 is a mitochondrial protein. The level of the mitochondrially targeted GFP fusion proteins was unexpectedly much lower than the nontargeted (cytoplasmic) forms. The distinction between targeted and nontargeted protein activities was investigated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in vivo. We found that targeting GFP to the mitochondria results in reduced levels of the fusion protein even though transcription of the fusion gene and the stability of the protein are unaffected. [(35)S]methionine labeling and GFP immunoprecipitation confirmed that mitochondrially targeted GFP is translated at much slower rates than nontargeted GFP. The results indicate a novel phenomenon, import-associated translational inhibition, whereby protein import into the mitochondria limits the rate of translation. The simplest explanation for this is that import of the GFP fusion proteins occurs cotranslationally, i.e., protein synthesis and import into mitochondria are coupled events. Consistent with cotranslational import, Northern analysis showed that the GFP mRNA is associated with isolated mitochondria. This association occurred regardless of whether the GFP was fused to a mitochondrial leader peptide. However, the presence of an import-competent leader peptide stabilized the mRNA-mitochondria association, rendering it more resistant to extensive EDTA washing. In contrast with GFP, the mRNA of another test protein, aequorin, did not associate with the mitochondria, and its translation was unaffected by import of the encoded polypeptide into the mitochondria.",

This pathway enables the formation of larger macropinocytic patches and macropinosomes, thereby dramatically increasing fluid uptake. Through phosphoproteomics, we identify a RhoGAP, GacG, as a PkbA and PkbR1 target, and show that it is required for efficient macropinocytosis and expansion of macropinocytic patches. The function of Akt and SGK in cell feeding through control of macropinosome size has implications for cancer cell biology.",

These so-called \"cheaters\" can have a fitness advantage in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether cheating provides an important selective advantage in nature. We used a population genomic approach to examine the history of genes involved in cheating behaviors in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, testing whether these genes experience rapid evolutionary change as a result of conflict over spore-stalk fate. Candidate genes and surrounding regions showed elevated polymorphism, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and lower levels of population differentiation, but they did not show greater between-species divergence. The signatures were most consistent with frequency-dependent selection acting to maintain multiple alleles, suggesting that conflict may lead to stalemate rather than an escalating arms race. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and cheating and underscore how sequence-based approaches can be used to elucidate the history of conflicts that are difficult to observe directly.",

The Dictyostelium genome encodes 285 predicted protein kinases, similar to the count of the much more advanced Drosophila. It contains members of most kinase classes shared by fungi and metazoans, as well as many previously thought to be metazoan specific, indicating that they have been secondarily lost from the fungal lineage. This includes the entire tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) group, which is expanded in Dictyostelium and includes several novel receptor kinases. Dictyostelium lacks tyrosine kinase group kinases, and most tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be mediated by TKL kinases. About half of Dictyostelium kinases occur in subfamilies not present in yeast or metazoa, suggesting that protein kinases have played key roles in the adaptation of Dictyostelium to its habitat.

One such protein is an evolutionarily conserved, secreted Acyl-CoA binding protein (known as AcbA in Dictyostelium discoideum, Acb1 in yeast and diazepam-binding inhibitor in mammals). Two recent papers highlighted in this punctum have elucidated the pathways required for the unconventional secretion of Acb1 in Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mammalian cells actively control cell-substrate binding and respond to extracellular conditions with localized integrin-containing focal adhesions mediating mechanotransduction. We asked whether mechanotransduction also occurs during non-integrin mediated migration by examining the motion of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which is thought to bind non-specifically to surfaces. We discovered that Dictyostelium cells are able to regulate forces generated by the actomyosin cortex to maintain optimal cell-surface contact area and adhesion on surfaces of various chemical composition and that individual cells migrate with similar speed and contact area on the different surfaces. In contrast, during collective migration, as observed in wound healing and metastasis, the balance between surface forces and protrusive forces is altered. We found that Dictyostelium collective migration dynamics are strongly affected when cells are plated on different surfaces. These results suggest that the presence of cell-cell contacts, which appear as Dictyostelium cells enter development, alter the mechanism cells use to migrate on surfaces of varying composition.",

Cells expressing constitutively active Rap1 are highly adhesive and exhibit strong chemotaxis defects, which are partially caused by an inability to spatially and temporally regulate myosin assembly and disassembly. We demonstrate that the kinase Phg2, a putative Rap1 effector, colocalizes with Rap1-guanosine triphosphate at the leading edge and is required in an in vitro assay for myosin II phosphorylation, which disassembles myosin II and facilitates filamentous actin-mediated leading edge protrusion. We suggest that Rap1/Phg2 plays a role in controlling leading edge myosin II disassembly while passively allowing myosin II assembly along the lateral sides and posterior of the cell.",

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has two Nramp proteins. Nramp1, like its mammalian ortholog (SLC11A1), is recruited to phagosomal and macropinosomal membranes, and confers resistance to pathogenic bacteria. Nramp2 is located exclusively in the contractile vacuole membrane and controls, synergistically with Nramp1, iron homeostasis. It has long been debated whether mammalian Nramp1 mediates iron import or export from phagosomes. By selectively loading the iron-chelating fluorochrome calcein in macropinosomes, we show that Dictyostelium Nramp1 mediates iron efflux from macropinosomes in vivo. To gain insight in ion selectivity and the transport mechanism, the proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Using a novel assay with calcein, and electrophysiological and radiochemical assays, we show that Nramp1, similar to rat DMT1 (also known as SLC11A2), transports Fe(2+) and manganese, not Fe(3+) or copper. Metal ion transport is electrogenic and proton dependent. By contrast, Nramp2 transports only Fe(2+) in a non-electrogenic and proton-independent way. These differences reflect evolutionary divergence of the prototypical Nramp2 protein sequence compared to the archetypical Nramp1 and DMT1 proteins.",

An open microfluidic device (OMD) was developed to provide quantitative information on both the gradient and morphological changes that occurred as cells crawled through various microfabricated channels. This device overcame problems that many current devices have been plagued with, such as complicated cell loading, media evaporation and channel blockage by air bubbles. We used a micropipette to set up stable gradients formed by passive diffusion and thus avoided confounding cellular responses produced by shear forces. Two versions of the OMD are reported here: one device that has channels with widths of 6, 8, 10 and 12 \u03bcm, while the other has two large 100 \u03bcm channels to minimize cellular interaction with lateral walls. These experiments compared the migration rates and qualitative behavior of Dictyostelium discoideum cells responding to measurable cAMP and folic acid gradients in small and large channels. We report on the influence that polarity has on a cell's ability to migrate when confined in a channel. Polarized cells that migrated to cAMP were significantly faster than the unpolarized cells that crawled toward folic acid. Unpolarized cells in wide channels often strayed off course, yet migrated faster than unpolarized cells in confined channels. Cells in channels farthest from the micropipette migrated through the channels at rates similar to cells in channels with higher concentrations, suggesting that cell speed was independent of mean concentration. Lastly, it was found that the polarized cells could easily change migration direction even when only the leading edge of the cell was exposed to a lateral gradient.",

        "abstract": "The genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is known to have a very high density of microsatellite repeats, including thousands of triplet microsatellite repeats in coding regions that apparently code for long runs of single amino acids. We used a mutation accumulation study to see if unusually high microsatellite mutation rates contribute to this pattern. There was a modest bias toward mutations that increase repeat number, but because upward mutations were smaller than downward ones, this did not lead to a net average increase in size. Longer microsatellites had higher mutation rates than shorter ones, but did not show greater directional bias. The most striking finding is that the overall mutation rate is the lowest reported for microsatellites: approximately 1 x 10(-6) for 10 dinucleotide loci and 6 x 10(-6) for 52 trinucleotide loci (which were longer). High microsatellite mutation rates therefore do not explain the high incidence of microsatellites. The causal relation may in fact be reversed, with low mutation rates evolving to protect against deleterious fitness effects of mutation at the numerous microsatellites.",

        "abstract": "Here we show that Dictyostelium discoideum dynamin A is a fast GTPase, binds to negatively charged lipids, and self-assembles into rings and helices in a nucleotide-dependent manner, similar to human dynamin-1. Chemical modification of two cysteine residues, positioned in the middle domain and GTPase effector domain (GED), leads to altered assembly properties and the stabilization of a highly regular ring complex. Single particle analysis of this dynamin A* ring complex led to a three-dimensional map, which shows that the nucleotide-free complex consists of two layers with 11-fold symmetry. Our results reveal the molecular organization of the complex and indicate the importance of the middle domain and GED for the assembly of dynamin family proteins. Nucleotide-dependent changes observed with the unmodified and modified protein support a mechanochemical action of dynamin, in which tightening and stretching of a helix contribute to membrane fission.",

        "abstract": "An increasing body of literature demonstrates the therapeutic relevance of polyphenols in eukaryotic cell and animal model studies. The phase II glutathione S-transferases (GST) show differential responses to thymoquinone, a major bioactive polyphenol constituent of the black seed, Nigella sativa. Beyond antioxidant defense, GSTs may act in non-enzymatic capacities to effect cell cycle, motility, and differentiation. Here, we report the impact of thymoquinone on the life cycle of the eukaryotic model Dictyostelium discoideum and accompanying profiles of its GST-alpha (DdGSTA) enzyme activity and isozyme expression. In silico molecular modeling revealed strong interaction(s) between thymoquinone and DdGSTA2 and DdGSTA3 isozymes that correlated with in vivo, dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of amoebae at 24, 48, and 72hr. Similarly, cytosolic DdGST enzyme activity (CDNB activity) was also responsive to different thymoquinone concentrations. Thymoquinone generally reduced expression of DdGSTA2 and DdGSTA3 isozymes in proliferating cells, however differential expression of the isozymes occurred during starvation. Thymoquinone effectively reduced early-stage aggregation of starved amoeba, accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species and altered expression of tubulin and contact site A (gp80), which resulted in reduced morphogenesis and fruiting body formation. These observations reveal that thymoquinone can impact signaling mechanisms that regulate proliferation and development in D. discoideum.",

Here, we investigated the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in controlling signaling of the chemoattractant cAMP in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> We found that cells lacking PKA display severe chemotaxis defects, including impaired directional sensing. Although PKA is an important regulator of developmental gene expression, including the cAMP receptor cAR1, our studies using exogenously expressed cAR1 in cells lacking PKA, cells lacking adenylyl cyclase A (ACA) and cells treated with the PKA-selective pharmacological inhibitor H89, suggest that PKA controls chemoattractant signal transduction, in part, through the regulation of RasG, Rap1 and TORC2. As these pathways control the ACA-mediated production of intracellular cAMP, they lie upstream of PKA in this chemoattractant signaling network. Consequently, we propose that the PKA-mediated regulation of the upstream RasG, Rap1 and TORC2 signaling pathways is part of a negative feedback mechanism controlling chemoattractant signal transduction during <i>Dictyostelium</i> chemotaxis.",

In this study we isolated and characterize a new mutant created by insertion of a mutagenic vector in the heretofore uncharacterized spdA gene. SpdA-ins mutant cells produce an altered, slightly shortened version of the SpdA protein. They spread more efficiently than WT cells when allowed to adhere to a glass substrate, and phagocytose particles more efficiently. On the contrary, a functional spdA knockout mutant where a large segment of the gene was deleted phagocytosed less efficiently and spread less efficiently on a substrate. These phenotypes were highly dependent on the cellular density, and were most visible at high cell densities, where secreted quorum-sensing factors inhibiting cell motility, spreading and phagocytosis are most active. These results identify the involvement of SpdA in the control of cell spreading and phagocytosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms, as well as the exact link between SpdA and cell spreading, remain to be established.",

The phenotypes of the mutants mhckA(-) and mhckC(-) were highly similar to that of the Ca(2+) channel/receptor mutant iplA(-) and the myosin II phosphorylation mutant 3XALA, which produces constitutively unphosphorylated myosin II. These results demonstrate that IplA, MhckA and MhckC play a selective role in chemotaxis in a spatial gradient of Ca(2+), but not cAMP, and suggest that Ca(2+) chemotaxis plays a role in the orientation of cells in the front of cAMP waves during natural aggregation.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum cells normally exist as individual amoebae, but will enter a period of multicellular development upon starvation. The initial stages of development involve the aggregation of individual cells, using cAMP as a chemoattractant. Chemotaxis is initiated when cAMP binds to its receptor, cAR1, and activates the associated G protein, G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3. However, chemotaxis will not occur unless there is a high density of starving cells present, as measured by high levels of the secreted quorum sensing molecule, CMF. We previously demonstrated that cells lacking PldB bypass the need for CMF and can aggregate at low cell density, whereas cells overexpressing pldB do not aggregate even at high cell density. Here, we found that PldB controlled both cAMP chemotaxis and cell sorting. PldB was also required by CMF to regulate G protein signaling. Specifically, CMF used PldB, to regulate the dissociation of G\u03b12 from G\u03b2\u03b3. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we found that along with cAMP, CMF increased the dissociation of the G protein. In fact, CMF augmented the dissociation induced by cAMP. This augmentation was lost in cells lacking PldB. PldB appears to mediate the CMF signal through the production of phosphatidic acid, as exogenously added phosphatidic acid phenocopies overexpression of pldB. These results suggest that phospholipase D activity is required for CMF to alter the kinetics of cAMP-induced G protein signaling.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A), a member of the atypical \u03b1-kinase family, phosphorylates sites in the myosin II tail that block filament assembly. Here we show that the catalytic activity of A-CAT, the \u03b1-kinase domain of MHCK A (residues 552-841), is severely inhibited by the removal of a disordered C-terminal tail sequence (C-tail; residues 806-841). The key residue in the C-tail was identified as Thr(825), which was found to be constitutively autophosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of Thr(825) using shrimp alkaline phosphatase decreased A-CAT activity. The activity of a truncated A-CAT lacking Thr(825) could be rescued by P(i), phosphothreonine, and a phosphorylated peptide, but not by threonine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or an unphosphorylated peptide. These results focused attention on a P(i)-binding pocket located in the C-terminal lobe of A-CAT. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the P(i)-pocket was essential for A-CAT activity. Based on these results, it is proposed that autophosphorylation of Thr(825) activates ACAT by providing a covalently tethered ligand for the P(i)-pocket. Ab initio modeling studies using the Rosetta FloppyTail and FlexPepDock protocols showed that it is feasible for the phosphorylated Thr(825) to dock intramolecularly into the P(i)-pocket. Allosteric activation is predicted to involve a conformational change in Arg(734), which bridges the bound P(i) to Asp(762) in a key active site loop. Sequence alignments indicate that a comparable regulatory mechanism is likely to be conserved in Dictyostelium MHCK B-D and metazoan eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinases.",

        "abstract": "Developing Dictyostelium cells aggregate to form fruiting bodies containing typically 2 x 10(4) cells. To prevent the formation of an excessively large fruiting body, streams of aggregating cells break up into groups if there are too many cells. The breakup is regulated by a secreted complex of polypeptides called counting factor (CF). Countin and CF50 are two of the components of CF. Disrupting the expression of either of these proteins results in cells secreting very little detectable CF activity, and as a result, aggregation streams remain intact and form large fruiting bodies, which invariably collapse. We find that disrupting the gene encoding a third protein present in crude CF, CF45-1, also results in the formation of large groups when cells are grown with bacteria on agar plates and then starve. However, unlike countin(-) and cf50(-) cells, cf45-1(-) cells sometimes form smaller groups than wild-type cells when the cells are starved on filter pads. The predicted amino acid sequence of CF45-1 has some similarity to that of lysozyme, but recombinant CF45-1 has no detectable lysozyme activity. In the exudates from starved cells, CF45-1 is present in a approximately 450-kDa fraction that also contains countin and CF50, suggesting that it is part of a complex. Recombinant CF45-1 decreases group size in colonies of cf45-1(-) cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of approximately 8 ng/ml and in colonies of wild-type and cf50(-) cells with an EC(50) of approximately 40 ng/ml. Like countin(-) and cf50(-) cells, cf45-1(-) cells have high levels of cytosolic glucose, high cell-cell adhesion, and low cell motility.

Here we report that Sentinel (S) cells of the multicellular slug stage of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum produce ETs upon stimulation with bacteria or lipopolysaccharide in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. The production of ETs by S cells requires a Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing protein TirA and reactive oxygen species-generating NADPH oxidases. Disruption of these genes results in decreased clearance of bacterial infections.

We show that both C2 and GAP domains are required for the membrane targeting of C2GAP1, and that GPCR-triggered Ras activation is necessary to recruit C2GAP1 from the cytosol and retains it on the membrane to locally inhibit Ras signaling.

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae are haploid and, as they share many features with animal cells, should be an ideal creature for studying basic processes such as cell locomotion. Isolation of mutants in this amoeba has largely been limited to non-essential genes: nsfA-the gene for NEM-sensitive factor-remains the only essential gene for which conditional (ts) mutants exist. These ts mutants were generated by gene replacement using a library of mutagenised nsfA containing a selectable marker: transformants were then screened for temperature sensitivity. The success of this approach depended on the high level of homologous recombination prevailing at this locus: approximately 95% of selected clones were homologous recombinants. This is unusually high for Dictyostelium: homologous recombination at other loci is usually much less, usually between 0-30%, making the isolation of ts mutants much more tedious.",

        "abstract": "Coronin proteins are evolutionary conserved WD repeat containing proteins that have been proposed to carry out different functions. In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, the short coronin isoform, coronin A, has been implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization, chemotaxis, phagocytosis and the initiation of multicellular development. Generally thought of as modulators of F-actin, coronin A and its mammalian homologs have also been shown to mediate cellular processes in an F-actin-independent manner. Therefore, it remains unclear whether or not coronin A carries out its functions through its capacity to interact with F-actin. Moreover, the interacting partners of coronin A are not known. Here, we analyzed the interactome of coronin A as well as its interaction with F-actin within cells and in vitro. Interactome analysis showed the association with a diverse set of interaction partners, including fimbrin, talin and myosin subunits, with only a transient interaction with the minor actin10 isoform, but not the major form of actin, actin8, which was consistent with the absence of a coronin A-actin interaction as analyzed by co-sedimentation from cells and lysates. In vitro, however, purified coronin A co-precipitated with rabbit muscle F-actin in a coiled-coil-dependent manner. Our results suggest that an in vitro interaction of coronin A and rabbit muscle actin may not reflect the cellular interaction state of coronin A with actin, and that coronin A interacts with diverse proteins in a time-dependent manner.",

Small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA-based phylogenies subdivide the known 150 species into four major and some minor groups, but lack resolution within groups, particularly group 4, and, as shown by genome-based phylogenies of 11 species, showed errors in the position of the root and nodes separating major clades. We are interested in the evolution of cell-type specialization, which particularly expanded in group 4. To construct a more robust phylogeny, we first included 7 recently sequenced genomes in the genome-based phylogeny of 47 functionally divergent proteins and next selected 6 proteins (Agl, AmdA, PurD, PurL, RpaA, SmdA) that independently or in sets of two fully reproduced the core-phylogeny. We amplified their coding regions from 34 Dictyostelium species and combined their concatenated sequences with those identified in the 18 genomes to generate a fully resolved phylogeny. The new AAPPRS based phylogeny (after the acronym of the 6 proteins) subdivides group 4 into 2 branches. These branches further resolve into 5 clades, rather than the progressively nested group 4 topology of the SSU rDNA tree, and also re-orders taxa in the other major groups. Ancestral state reconstruction of 25 phenotypic traits returned higher \"goodness of fit\" metrics for evolution of 19 of those traits over the AAPPRS tree, than over the SSU rDNA tree. The novel tree provides a solid framework for studying the evolution of cell-type specialization, signalling and other cellular processes in particularly group 4, which contains the model Dictyostelid D. discoideum.",

In this study, we first showed that this strain has a premature stop codon in its alg9 mannosyltransferase gene compatible with the occurrence of truncated N-glycans. These were subject to an optimized analytical workflow, considering that the mass spectrometry of acidic glycans often presents challenges due to neutral loss and suppression effects. Therefore, the protein-bound N-glycans were first fractionated, after serial enzymatic release, by solid phase extraction. Then primarily single glycan species were isolated by mixed hydrophilic-interaction/anion-exchange or reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed using chemical and enzymatic treatments and MS/MS. We show that protein-linked N-glycans of the mutant are of reduced size as compared to those of wild-type AX3, but still contain core \u03b11,3-fucose, intersecting N-acetylglucosamine, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, methylphosphate, phosphate, and sulfate residues. We observe that a single N-glycan can carry up to four of these six possible modifications.

In this paper we use mathematical modelling together with ideas from robust control theory to identify two factors which appear to make crucial contributions to ensuring the robustness of these oscillations. Firstly, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the molecular interactions play an important role in preserving stable oscillations in the face of variations in the kinetics of the intracellular network. Secondly, we show that synchronisation of the aggregating cells through the diffusion of extracellular cAMP is a key factor in ensuring robustness of the oscillatory waves of cAMP observed in Dictyostelium cell cultures to cell-to-cell variations. A striking and quite general implication of the results is that the robustness analysis of models of oscillating biomolecular networks (circadian clocks, Ca(2+) oscillations, etc.) can only be done reliably by using stochastic simulations, even in the case where molecular concentrations are very high.",

Using ultrastructural reconstructions, we now show that ACA-containing MVBs release their contents to attract neighboring cells. We show that the released vesicles are capable of directing migration and streaming and are central to chemotactic signal relay. We demonstrate that the released vesicles not only contain cAMP but also can actively synthesize and release cAMP to promote chemotaxis. Through proteomic, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, we determined that the vesicular cAMP is released via the ABCC8 transporter.

Relatively little is known about chemorepulsion, where cells move away from a repellent signal. We previously identified pathways mediating chemorepulsion in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, and here we show that these pathways, including Ras, Rac, protein kinase C, PTEN, and ERK1 and 2, are required for human neutrophil chemorepulsion, and, as with <i>Dictyostelium</i> chemorepulsion, PI3K and phospholipase C are not necessary, suggesting that eukaryotic chemorepulsion mechanisms are conserved. Surprisingly, there were differences between male and female neutrophils. Inhibition of Rho-associated kinases or Cdc42 caused male neutrophils to be more repelled by a chemorepellent and female neutrophils to be attracted to the chemorepellent. In the presence of a chemorepellent, compared with male neutrophils, female neutrophils showed a reduced percentage of repelled neutrophils, greater persistence of movement, more adhesion, less accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, and less polymerization of actin. Five proteins associated with chemorepulsion pathways are differentially abundant, with three of the five showing sex dimorphism in protein localization in unstimulated male and female neutrophils. Together, this indicates a fundamental difference in a motility mechanism in the innate immune system in men and women.",

Proteomics of purified\u00a0LCVs indicate the presence of membrane contact sites (MCS)\u00a0proteins possibly implicated in lipid exchange. Using dually\u00a0fluorescence-labeled Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba, we reveal\u00a0that VAMP-associated protein (Vap) and the PtdIns(4)P 4-phosphatase Sac1 localize to the ER, and Vap also localizes to the LCV membrane. Furthermore, Vap as well as Sac1 promote intracellular replication of L.\u00a0pneumophila and LCV remodeling. Oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs) preferentially localize to the ER (OSBP8) or the LCV membrane (OSBP11), respectively, and restrict (OSBP8) or promote (OSBP11) bacterial replication and LCV expansion. The sterol probes GFP-D4H* and filipin indicate that sterols are rapidly depleted from LCVs, while PtdIns(4)P accumulates. In addition to Sac1, the PtdIns(4)P-subverting L.\u00a0pneumophila effector proteins LepB and SidC also support LCV remodeling.

Here, we investigated dynamic subcellular localization of cortexillin I in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells. Most of the cortexillin I was enriched on the lateral sides of moving cells. Upon chemoattractant stimulation, cortexillin I was rapidly released from the cortex followed by a transient translocation to the cell cortex with a peak at ~5 s and a subsequent decrease to basal levels, indicating that localization of cor-texillin I at the cortex in chemotaxing cells is controlled by two more signaling components, one for the initial delocalization from the cortex and another for the translocation to the cortex ~5 s after chemoattractant stimulation. Loss of cortexillins leads to reduced cell polarity and an increased number of lateral pseudopodia during chemotaxis, suggesting that cortexillins play an inhibitory role in producing pseudopodia along the lateral sides of the cell. Cells lacking cortexillins displayed extended chemoattrac-tant-mediated Arp2/3 complex translocation kinetics to the cortex. Our present study provides a new insight into the function of cortexillins during reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.",

        "abstract": "In\u00a0vivo, cells navigate through complex environments filled with obstacles such as other cells and the extracellular matrix. Recently, the term \"topotaxis\" has been introduced for navigation along topographic cues such as obstacle density gradients. Experimental and mathematical efforts have analyzed topotaxis of single cells in pillared grids with pillar density gradients. A previous model based on active Brownian particles (ABPs) has shown that ABPs perform topotaxis, i.e., drift toward lower pillar densities, due to decreased effective persistence lengths at high pillar densities. The ABP model predicted topotactic drifts of up to 1% of the instantaneous speed, whereas drifts of up to 5% have been observed experimentally. We hypothesized that the discrepancy between the ABP and the experimental observations could be in 1) cell deformability and 2) more complex cell-pillar interactions. Here, we introduce a more detailed model of topotaxis based on the cellular Potts model (CPM). To model persistent cells we use the Act model, which mimics actin-polymerization-driven motility, and a hybrid CPM-ABP model. Model parameters were fitted to simulate the experimentally found motion of Dictyostelium discoideum on a flat surface. For starved D.\u00a0discoideum, the topotactic drifts predicted by both CPM variants are closer to the experimental results than the previous ABP model due to a larger decrease in persistence length. Furthermore, the Act model outperformed the\u00a0hybrid model in terms of topotactic efficiency, as it shows a larger reduction in effective persistence time in dense pillar grids. Also pillar adhesion can slow down cells and decrease topotaxis. For slow and less-persistent vegetative D.\u00a0discoideum cells, both CPMs predicted a similar small topotactic drift. We conclude that deformable cell volume results in higher topotactic drift compared with ABPs, and that feedback of cell-pillar collisions on cell persistence increases drift only in highly persistent cells.",

        "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine. It is also undergoing trials for cancer therapy. However, the biochemical and molecular biological actions of VPA are poorly understood. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we show that an acute effect of VPA is the inhibition of chemotactic cell movement, a process partially dependent upon phospholipid signaling. Analysis of this process shows that VPA attenuates the signal-induced translocation of PH(Crac)-green fluorescent protein from cytosol to membrane, suggesting the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) production. Direct labeling of lipids in vivo also shows a reduction in PIP and PIP(2) phosphorylation following VPA treatment. We further show that VPA acutely reduces endocytosis and exocytosis-processes previously shown to be dependent upon PIP(3) production. These results suggest that in Dictyostelium, VPA rapidly attenuates phospholipid signaling to reduce endocytic trafficking. To examine this effect in a mammalian model, we also tested depolarization-dependent neurotransmitter release in rat nerve terminals, and we show that this process is also suppressed upon application of VPA and an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Although a more comprehensive analysis of the effect of VPA on lipid signaling will be necessary in mammalian systems, these results suggest that VPA may function to reduce phospholipid signaling processes and thus may provide a novel therapeutic effect for this drug.",

        "abstract": "Stable multipartite mutualistic associations require that all partners benefit. We show that a single mutational step is sufficient to turn a symbiotic bacterium from an inedible but host-beneficial secondary metabolite producer into a host food source. The bacteria's host is a \"farmer\" clone of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum that carries and disperses bacteria during its spore stage. Associated with the farmer are two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, only one of which serves as a food source. The other strain produces diffusible small molecules: pyrrolnitrin, a known antifungal agent, and a chromene that potently enhances the farmer's spore production and depresses a nonfarmer's spore production. Genome sequence and phylogenetic analyses identify a derived point mutation in the food strain that generates a premature stop codon in a global activator (gacA), encoding the response regulator of a two-component regulatory system. Generation of a knockout mutant of this regulatory gene in the nonfood bacterial strain altered its secondary metabolite profile to match that of the food strain, and also, independently, converted it into a food source. These results suggest that a single mutation in an inedible ancestral strain that served a protective role converted it to a \"domesticated\" food source.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae have been used extensively to study the structure and dynamics of the endocytic pathway. Here, we show that while the general structure of the endocytic pathway is maintained in starved cells, its dynamics rapidly slow down. In addition, analysis of apm3 and lvsB mutants reveals that the functional organization of the endocytic pathway is profoundly modified upon starvation. Indeed, in these mutant cells, some of the defects observed in rich medium persist in starved cells, notably an abnormally slow transfer of endocytosed material between endocytic compartments. Other parameters, such as endocytosis of the fluid phase or the rate of fusion of postlysosomes to the cell surface, vary dramatically upon starvation. Studying the endocytic pathway in starved cells can provide a different perspective, allowing the primary (invariant) defects resulting from specific mutations to be distinguished from their secondary (conditional) consequences.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis and the predominant cause of zoonotic tuberculosis in people. Bovine tuberculosis occurs in farmed cattle but also in a variety of wild animals, which form a reservoir of infection. Although direct transmission of tuberculosis occurs between mammals, the low frequency of contact between different host species and abundant shedding of bacilli by infected animals suggests an infectious route via environmental contamination. Other intracellular pathogens that transmit via the environment deploy strategies to survive or exploit predation by environmental amoebae. To explore if M. bovis has this capability, we investigated its interactions with the soil and dung-dwelling amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. We demonstrated that M. bovis evades phagocytosis and destruction by D. discoideum and actively transits through the amoeba using the ESX-1 Type VII Secretion System as part of a programme of mechanisms, many of which have been co-opted as virulence factors in the mammalian host. This capacity of M. bovis to utilise an environmental stage between mammalian hosts may enhance its transmissibility. In addition, our data provide molecular evidence to support an evolutionary role for amoebae as training grounds for the pathogenic M. tuberculosis complex.",

        "abstract": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in a gene encoding a protein named LYST in humans (\"lysosomal trafficking regulator\") or Beige in mice. A prominent feature of this disease is the accumulation of enlarged lysosome-related granules in a variety of cells. The genome of Dictyostelium discoideum contains six genes encoding proteins that are related to LYST/Beige in amino acid sequence, and disruption of one of these genes, lvsA (large volume sphere), results in profound defects in cytokinesis. To better understand the function of this family of proteins in membrane trafficking, we have analyzed mutants disrupted in lvsA, lvsB, lvsC, lvsD, lvsE, and lvsF. Of all these, only lvsA and lvsB mutants displayed interesting phenotypes in our assays. lvsA-null cells exhibited defects in phagocytosis and contained abnormal looking contractile vacuole membranes. Loss of LvsB, the Dictyostelium protein most similar to LYST/Beige, resulted in the formation of enlarged vesicles that by multiple criteria appeared to be acidic lysosomes. The rates of endocytosis, phagocytosis, and fluid phase exocytosis were normal in lvsB-null cells. Also, the rates of processing and the efficiency of targeting of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase were normal, although lvsB mutants inefficiently retained alpha-mannosidase, as well as two other lysosomal cysteine proteinases. Finally, results of pulse-chase experiments indicated that an increase in fusion rates accounted for the enlarged lysosomes in lvsB-null cells, suggesting that LvsB acts as a negative regulator of fusion. Our results support the notion that LvsB/LYST/Beige function in a similar manner to regulate lysosome biogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Motile eukaryotic cells migrate with directional persistence by alternating left and right turns, even in the absence of external cues. For example, Dictyostelium discoideum cells crawl by extending distinct pseudopods in an alternating right-left pattern. The mechanisms underlying this zig-zag behavior, however, remain unknown. Here we propose a new Excitable Cortex and Memory (EC&M) model for understanding the alternating, zig-zag extension of pseudopods. Incorporating elements of previous models, we consider the cell cortex as an excitable system and include global inhibition of new pseudopods while a pseudopod is active. With the novel hypothesis that pseudopod activity makes the local cortex temporarily more excitable--thus creating a memory of previous pseudopod locations--the model reproduces experimentally observed zig-zag behavior. Furthermore, the EC&M model makes four new predictions concerning pseudopod dynamics. To test these predictions we develop an algorithm that detects pseudopods via hierarchical clustering of individual membrane extensions. Data from cell-tracking experiments agrees with all four predictions of the model, revealing that pseudopod placement is a non-Markovian process affected by the dynamics of previous pseudopods. The model is also compatible with known limits of chemotactic sensitivity. In addition to providing a predictive approach to studying eukaryotic cell motion, the EC&M model provides a general framework for future models, and suggests directions for new research regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying directional persistence.",

        "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei is an emerging bacterial pathogen and category B biothreat. Human infections with B. pseudomallei (called melioidosis) present as a range of manifestations, including acute septicemia and pneumonia. Although melioidosis can be fatal, little is known about the molecular basis of B. pseudomallei pathogenicity, in part because of the lack of simple, genetically tractable eukaryotic models to facilitate en masse identification of virulence determinants or explore host-pathogen interactions. Two assays, one high-throughput and one quantitative, were developed to monitor levels of resistance of B. pseudomallei and the closely related nearly avirulent species Burkholderia thailandensis to predation by the phagocytic amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. The quantitative assay showed that levels of resistance to, and survival within, amoeba by these bacteria and their known virulence mutants correlate well with their published levels of virulence in animals. Using the high-throughput assay, we screened a 1,500-member B. thailandensis transposon mutant library and identified 13 genes involved in resistance to predation by D. discoideum. Orthologs of these genes were disrupted in B. pseudomallei, and nearly all mutants had similarly decreased resistance to predation by D. discoideum. For some mutants, decreased resistance also correlated with reduced survival in and cytotoxicity toward macrophages, as well as attenuated virulence in mice. These observations suggest that some factors required by B. pseudomallei for resistance to environmental phagocytes also aid in resistance to phagocytic immune cells and contribute to disease in animals. Thus, D. discoideum provides a novel, high-throughput model system for facilitating inquiry into B. pseudomallei virulence.",

A subset of D. discoideum strains isolated from soil persistently carry symbiotic <i>Paraburkholderia</i>, recently formally described as <i>P. agricolaris</i>, <i>P. bonniea</i>, and <i>P. hayleyella</i>. The three facultative symbiont species of D. discoideum present a unique opportunity to study a naturally occurring symbiosis in a laboratory model protist. There is a large difference in genome size between <i>P. agricolaris</i> (8.7 million base pairs [Mbp]) versus <i>P. hayleyella</i> and <i>P. bonniea</i> (4.1 Mbp). We took a comparative genomics approach and compared the three genomes of D. discoideum symbionts to 12 additional <i>Paraburkholderia</i> genomes to test for genome evolution patterns that frequently accompany host adaptation. Overall, <i>P. agricolaris</i> is difficult to distinguish from other <i>Paraburkholderia</i> based on its genome size and content, but the reduced genomes of <i>P. bonniea</i> and <i>P. hayleyella</i> display characteristics indicative of genome streamlining rather than deterioration during adaptation to their protist hosts. In addition, D. discoideum-symbiont genomes have increased secretion system and motility genes that may mediate interactions with their host. Specifically, adjacent BurBor-like type 3 and T6SS-5-like type 6 secretion system operons shared among all three D. discoideum-symbiont genomes may be important for host interaction. Horizontal transfer of these secretion system operons within the amoeba host environment may have contributed to the unique ability of these symbionts to establish and maintain a symbiotic relationship with D. discoideum. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Protists are a diverse group of typically single cell eukaryotes. Bacteria and archaea that form long-term symbiotic relationships with protists may evolve in additional ways than those in relationships with multicellular eukaryotes such as plants, animals, or fungi. Social amoebas are a predatory soil protist sometimes found with symbiotic bacteria living inside their cells. They present a unique opportunity to explore a naturally occurring symbiosis in a protist frequently used for studying host-pathogen interactions. We show that one amoeba-symbiont species is similar to other related bacteria in genome size and content, while the two reduced-genome-symbiont species show characteristics of genome streamlining rather than deterioration during adaptation to their host. We also identify sets of genes present in all three amoeba-symbiont genomes that are potentially used for host-symbiont interactions. Because the amoeba symbionts are distantly related, the amoeba host environment may be where these genes were shared among symbionts.",

We examined the composition of clathrin-coated vesicles on an internal organelle responsible for osmoregulation, the Dictyostelium discoideum contractile vacuole. Clathrin puncta on contractile vacuoles contained multiple accessory proteins typical of plasma membrane-coated pits, including AP2, AP180, and epsin, but not Hip1r. To examine how these clathrin accessory proteins influenced the contractile vacuole, we generated cell lines that carried single and double gene knockouts in the same genetic background. Single or double mutants that lacked AP180 or AP2 exhibited abnormally large contractile vacuoles. The enlarged contractile vacuoles in AP180-null mutants formed because of excessive homotypic fusion among contractile vacuoles. The SNARE protein Vamp7B was mislocalized and enriched on the contractile vacuoles of AP180-null mutants. In vitro assays revealed that AP180 interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of Vamp7B. We propose that AP180 directs Vamp7B into clathrin-coated vesicles on contractile vacuoles, creating an efficient mechanism for regulating the internal distribution of fusion-competent SNARE proteins and limiting homotypic fusions among contractile vacuoles. Dictyostelium contractile vacuoles offer a valuable system to study clathrin-coated vesicles on internal organelles within eukaryotic cells.",

Using the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a model system for the study of chemotaxis, we demonstrate that cell shape changes in a wave-like manner. Cells have regions of high boundary curvature that propagate from the leading edge toward the back, usually along alternating sides of the cell. Curvature waves are easily seen in cells that do not adhere to a surface, such as cells that are electrostatically repelled from surfaces or cells that extend over the edge of micro-fabricated cliffs. Without surface contact, curvature waves travel from the leading edge to the back of a cell at -35 \u00b5m/min. Non-adherent myosin II null cells do not exhibit these curvature waves. At the leading edge of adherent cells, curvature waves are associated with protrusive activity. Like regions of high curvature, protrusive activity travels along the boundary in a wave-like manner. Upon contact with a surface, the protrusions stop moving relative to the surface, and the boundary shape thus reflects the history of protrusive motion. The wave-like character of protrusions provides a plausible mechanism for the zig-zagging of pseudopods and for the ability of cells both to swim in viscous fluids and to navigate complex three dimensional topography.",

The regulated sequestration of sulfur maintains D.\u00a0discoideum in a nonproliferating state that paves the way for multicellular development.

        "abstract": "Cells respond to a variety of secreted molecules by modifying their physiology, growth patterns, and behavior. Motile bacteria and eukaryotic cells can sense extracellular chemoattractants and chemorepellents and alter their movement. In this way fibroblasts and leukocytes can find their way to sites of injury and cancer cells can home in on sites that are releasing growth factors. Social amoebae such as Dictyostelium are chemotactic to cAMP which they secrete several hours after they have initiated development. These eukaryotic cells are known to be able to sense extremely shallow gradients but the processes underlying their exquisite sensitivity are still largely unknown. In this study we determine the responses of developed cells of Dictyostelium discoideum to stable linear gradients of cAMP of varying steepness generated in 2 \u03bcm deep gradient chambers of microfluidic devices. The gradients are generated by molecular diffusion between two 80 \u03bcm deep flow-through channels, one of which is perfused with a solution of cAMP and the other with buffer, serving as continuously replenished source and sink. These low ceiling gradient chambers constrained the cells in the vertical dimension, facilitating confocal imaging, such that subcellular localization of fluorescently tagged proteins could be followed for up to 30 min without noticeable phototoxicity. Chemotactic cells enter these low ceiling chambers by flattening and elongating and then move almost as rapidly as unconstrained cells. By following the localization of activated Ras (RasGTP) using a Ras Binding Domain fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (RBD-GFP), we observed the rapid appearance of membrane associated patches at the tips of pseudopods. These patches remained associated with pseudopods while they continued to extend but were rapidly disassembled when pseudopods stalled and the cell moved past them. Likewise, fluorescence associated with localized RasGTP rapidly disappeared when the gradient was turned off. Correlation of the size and persistence of RasGTP patches with extension of pseudopods may set the rules for understanding how the signal transduction mechanisms convert a weak external signal to a strong directional bias.",

        "abstract": "The effect of binding the Trp-free motor domain mutant of Dictyostelium discoideum, rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1, and tropomyosin on the dynamics and conformation of actin filaments was characterized by an analysis of steady-state tryptophan phosphorescence spectra and phosphorescence decay kinetics over a temperature range of 140-293 K. The binding of the Trp-free motor domain mutant of D. discoideum to actin caused red shifts in the phosphorescence spectrum of two internal Trp residues of actin and affected the intrinsic lifetime of each emitter, decreasing by roughly twofold the short phosphorescence lifetime components (tau(1) and tau(2)) and increasing by approximately 20% the longest component (tau(3)). The alteration of actin phosphorescence by the motor protein suggests that i), structural changes occur deep down in the core of actin and that ii), subtle changes in conformation appear also on the surface but in regions distant from the motor domain binding site. When actin formed complexes with skeletal S1, an extra phosphorescence lifetime component appeared (tau(4), twice as long as tau(3)) in the phosphorescence decay that is absent in the isolated proteins. The lack of this extra component in the analogous actin-Trp-free motor domain mutant of D. discoideum complex suggests that it should be assigned to Trps in S1 that in the complex attain a more compact local structure. Our data indicated that the binding of tropomyosin to actin filaments had no effect on the structure or flexibility of actin observable by this technique.",

        "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is surrounded by a mucin coat that plays important functions in parasite survival/invasion and is extensively O-glycosylated by Golgi and cell surface glycosyltransferases. The addition of the first sugar, alpha-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) linked to Threonine (Thr), is catalyzed by a polypeptide alpha-GlcNAc-transferase (pp-alphaGlcNAcT) which is unstable to purification. Here, a comparison of the genomes of T. cruzi and Dictyostelium discoideum, an amoebazoan which also forms this linkage, identified two T. cruzi genes (TcOGNT1 and TcOGNT2) that might encode this activity. Though neither was able to complement the Dictyostelium gene, expression in the trypanosomatid Leishmania tarentolae resulted in elevated levels of UDP-[(3)H]GlcNAc:Thr-peptide GlcNAc-transferase activity and UDP-[(3)H]GlcNAc breakdown activity. The ectodomain of TcOGNT2 was expressed and the secreted protein was found to retain both activities after extensive purification away from other proteins and the endogenous activity. Product analysis showed that (3)H was transferred as GlcNAc to a hydroxyamino acid, and breakdown was due to hydrolysis. Both activities were specific for UDP-GlcNAc relative to UDP-GalNAc and were abolished by active site point mutations that inactivate a related Dictyostelium enzyme and distantly related animal pp-alphaGalNAcTs. The peptide preference and the alkaline pH optimum were indistinguishable from those of the native activity in T. cruzi microsomes. The results suggest that mucin-type O-glycosylation in T. cruzi is initiated by conserved members of CAZy family GT60, which is homologous to the GT27 family of animal pp-alphaGalNAcTs that initiate mucin-type O-glycosylation in animals.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is a useful model for studying mechanisms of cisplatin drug sensitivity. Our previous findings, that mutations in sphingolipid metabolism genes confer cisplatin resistance in D. discoideum and in human cells, raised interest in the resistance mechanisms and their implications for cisplatin chemotherapy. Here we used expression microarrays to monitor physiological changes and to identify pathways that are affected by cisplatin treatment of D. discoideum. We found >400 genes whose regulation was altered by cisplatin treatment of wild-type cells, including groups of genes that participate in cell proliferation and in nucleotide and protein metabolism, showing that the cisplatin response is orderly and multifaceted. Transcriptional profiling of two isogenic cisplatin-resistant mutants, impaired in different sphingolipid metabolism steps, showed that the effect of cisplatin treatment was greater than the effect of the mutations, indicating that cisplatin resistance in the mutants is due to specific abilities to overcome the drug effects rather than to general drug insensitivity. Nevertheless, the mutants exhibited significantly different responses to cisplatin compared with the parent, and >200 genes accounted for that difference. Mutations in five cisplatin response genes (sgkB, csbA, acbA, smlA, and atg8) resulted in altered drug sensitivity, implicating novel pathways in cisplatin response. Our data illustrate how modeling complex cellular responses to drugs in genetically stable and tractable systems can uncover new targets with the potential for improving chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "In the compact Dictyostelium discoideum genome, non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons known as TREs avoid accidental integration-mediated gene disruption by targeting the vicinity of tRNA genes. In this study we provide the first evidence that proteins of a non-LTR retrotransposon interact with a target-specific transcription factor to direct its integration. We applied an in vivo selection system that allows for the isolation of natural TRE5-A integrations into a known genomic location upstream of tRNA genes. TRE5-A frequently modified the integration site in a way characteristic of other non-LTR retrotransposons by adding nontemplated extra nucleotides and generating small and extended target site deletions. Mutations within the B-box promoter of the targeted tRNA genes interfered with both the in vitro binding of RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC and the ability of TRE5-A to target these genes. An isolated B box was sufficient to enhance TRE5-A integration in the absence of a surrounding tRNA gene. The RNA polymerase III-transcribed ribosomal 5S gene recruits TFIIIC in a B-box-independent manner, yet it was readily targeted by TRE5-A in our assay. These results suggest a direct role of an RNA polymerase III transcription factor in the targeting process.",

        "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetically diverse and clinically characterised by lower limb weakness and spasticity. The N471D and several other point mutations of human strumpellin (Str; also known as WASHC5), a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) complex, have been shown to cause a form of HSP known as spastic paraplegia 8 (SPG8). To investigate the molecular functions of wild-type (WT) and N417D Str, we generated <i>Dictyostelium</i> Str<sup>-</sup> cells and ectopically expressed Str<sup>WT</sup>-GFP or Str<sup>N471D</sup>-GFP in Str<sup>-</sup> and WT cells. Overexpression of both proteins apparently caused a defect in cell division, as we observed a clear increase in multinucleate cells. Real-time PCR analyses revealed no transcriptional changes in WASH complex subunits in Str<sup>-</sup> cells, but western blots showed a twofold decrease in the SWIP subunit. GFP-trap experiments in conjunction with mass-spectrometric analysis revealed many previously known, as well as new, Str-interacting proteins, and also proteins that no longer bind to Str<sup>N471D</sup> At the cellular level, Str<sup>-</sup> cells displayed defects in cell growth, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, exocytosis and lysosomal function. Expression of Str<sup>WT</sup>-GFP in Str<sup>-</sup> cells rescued all observed defects. In contrast, expression of Str<sup>N471D</sup>-GFP could not rescue lysosome morphology and exocytosis of indigestible material. Our results underscore a key role for the WASH complex and its core subunit, Str, in the endolysosomal system, and highlight the fundamental importance of the Str N471 residue for maintaining lysosome morphology and dynamics. Our data indicate that the SPG8-causing N471D mutation leads to a partial loss of Str function in the endolysosomal system.

        "abstract": "Ketogenic diets, used in epilepsy treatment, are considered to work through reduced glucose and ketone generation to regulate a range of cellular process including autophagy induction. Recent studies into the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet have suggested that medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) provided in the diet, decanoic acid and octanoic acid, cause specific therapeutic effects independent of glucose reduction, although a role in autophagy has not been investigated. Both autophagy and MCFAs have been widely studied in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, with findings providing important advances in the study of autophagy-related pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we utilize this model to analyze a role for MCFAs in regulating autophagy. We show that treatment with decanoic acid but not octanoic acid induces autophagosome formation and modulates autophagic flux in high glucose conditions. To investigate this effect, decanoic acid, but not octanoic acid, was found to induce the expression of autophagy-inducing proteins (Atg1 and Atg8), providing a mechanism for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate a range of related fatty acid derivatives with seizure control activity, 4BCCA, 4EOA, and Epilim (valproic acid), also function to induce autophagosome formation in this model. Thus, our data suggest that decanoic acid and related compounds may provide a less-restrictive therapeutic approach to activate autophagy.",

A genetic screen in Dictyostelium discoideum to identify redundant pathways revealed a gene with homology to patatin-like phospholipase A(2). Loss of this gene did not alter PI(3,4,5)P(3) regulation, but chemotaxis became sensitive to reductions in PI3K activity. Likewise, cells deficient in PI3K activity were more sensitive to inhibition of PLA(2) activity. Deletion of the PLA(2) homolog and two PI3Ks caused a strong defect in chemotaxis and a reduction in receptor-mediated actin polymerization. In wild-type cells, chemoattractants stimulated a rapid burst in an arachidonic acid derivative. This response was absent in cells lacking the PLA(2) homolog, and exogenous arachidonic acid reduced their dependence on PI3K signaling. We propose that PLA(2) and PI3K signaling act in concert to mediate chemotaxis, and metabolites of PLA(2) may be important mediators of the response.",

        "abstract": "The macropinocytic pathway in Dictyostelium discoideum is organized linearly. After actin-driven internalization, fluid material passes sequentially from endosomes to lysosomes, where molecules are degraded and absorbed. Residual material is exocytosed via post-lysosomal compartments. Syntaxin 7 is a SNARE (soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) protein that is present and active in D. discoideum endosomes [Bogdanovic, Bruckert, Morio and Satre (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36691-36697]. Here we report the identification of its main SNARE partners by co-immunoprecipitation and MS peptide sequencing. The syntaxin 7 complex contains two co-t-SNAREs [Vti1 (Vps10p tail interactor 1) and syntaxin 8] and a v-SNARE [VAMP7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7)] (where t-SNAREs are SNAREs of the target compartment and v-SNAREs are SNAREs present in donor vesicles). In endosomes and in vitro, syntaxin 7, Vti1 and syntaxin 8 form a complex that is able to bind VAMP7. Antibodies to syntaxin 8 and a soluble recombinant VAMP7 fragment both inhibit in vitro reconstituted D. discoideum endosome fusion. The lysosomal content of syntaxin 7, Vti1, syntaxin 8 and VAMP7 is low compared with that in endosomes, implying a highly active recycling or retention mechanism. A likely model is that VAMP7 is a v-SNARE present on vesicles carrying lysosomal enzymes, and that the syntaxin 7-Vti1-syntaxin 8 t-SNARE complex is associated with incoming endocytic material.",

Its cellular localization is dependent not only on signal transduction pathways, but also on mechanical stress. We suggest that this stress-dependent distribution is the result of both the force-dependent binding to actin filaments and cooperative interactions between bound myosin heads. By assuming that the binding of myosin heads induces and/or stabilizes local conformational changes in the actin filaments that enhances myosin II binding locally, we successfully simulate the cooperative binding of myosin to actin observed experimentally. In addition, we can interpret the cooperative interactions between myosin and actin cross-linking proteins observed in cellular mechanosensation, provided that a similar mechanism operates among different proteins. Finally, we present a model that couples cooperative interactions to the assembly dynamics of myosin bipolar thick filaments and that accounts for the transient behaviors of the myosin II accumulation during mechanosensation. This mechanism is likely to be general for a range of myosin II-dependent cellular mechanosensory processes.",

The cellular mechanisms involved in intracellular killing, their relative importance, and their specificity towards different bacteria are however poorly defined. In this study, we used Dictyostelium discoideum, a phagocytic cell model amenable to genetic analysis, to identify new gene products involved in intracellular killing. A random genetic screen led us to identify the role of Vps13F in intracellular killing of Klebsiella\u00a0pneumoniae. Vps13F knock-out (KO) cells exhibited a delayed intracellular killing of K.\u00a0pneumoniae, although the general organization of the phagocytic and endocytic pathway appeared largely unaffected. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that vps13F\u00a0KO cells may be functionally similar to previously characterized fspA\u00a0KO cells, shown to be defective in folate sensing. Indeed, vps13F\u00a0KO cells showed a decreased chemokinetic response to various stimulants, suggesting a direct or indirect role of Vps13F in intracellular signaling. Overstimulation with excess folate restored efficient killing in vps13F\u00a0KO cells. Finally, genetic inactivation of Far1, the folate receptor, resulted in inefficient intracellular killing of K.\u00a0pneumoniae. Together, these observations show that stimulation of Dictyostelium by bacterial folate is necessary for rapid intracellular killing of K.\u00a0pneumoniae.",

        "abstract": "Collective behavior in cellular populations is coordinated by biochemical signaling networks within individual cells. Connecting the dynamics of these intracellular networks to the population phenomena they control poses a considerable challenge because of network complexity and our limited knowledge of kinetic parameters. However, from physical systems, we know that behavioral changes in the individual constituents of a collectively behaving system occur in a limited number of well-defined classes, and these can be described using simple models. Here, we apply such an approach to the emergence of collective oscillations in cellular populations of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Through direct tests of our model with quantitative in vivo measurements of single-cell and population signaling dynamics, we show how a simple model can effectively describe a complex molecular signaling network at multiple size and temporal scales. The model predicts novel noise-driven single-cell and population-level signaling phenomena that we then experimentally observe. Our results suggest that like physical systems, collective behavior in biology may be universal and described using simple mathematical models.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis, the directed motion of a cell toward a chemical source, plays a key role in many essential biological processes. Here, we derive a statistical model that quantitatively describes the chemotactic motion of eukaryotic cells in a chemical gradient. Our model is based on observations of the chemotactic motion of the social ameba Dictyostelium discoideum, a model organism for eukaryotic chemotaxis. A large number of cell trajectories in stationary, linear chemoattractant gradients is measured, using microfluidic tools in combination with automated cell tracking. We describe the directional motion as the interplay between deterministic and stochastic contributions based on a Langevin equation. The functional form of this equation is directly extracted from experimental data by angle-resolved conditional averages. It contains quadratic deterministic damping and multiplicative noise. In the presence of an external gradient, the deterministic part shows a clear angular dependence that takes the form of a force pointing in gradient direction. With increasing gradient steepness, this force passes through a maximum that coincides with maxima in both speed and directionality of the cells. The stochastic part, on the other hand, does not depend on the orientation of the directional cue and remains independent of the gradient magnitude. Numerical simulations of our probabilistic model yield quantitative agreement with the experimental distribution functions. Thus our model captures well the dynamics of chemotactic cells and can serve to quantify differences and similarities of different chemotactic eukaryotes. Finally, on the basis of our model, we can characterize the heterogeneity within a population of chemotactic cells.",

        "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses comprise a group of neurodegenerative disorders with similar clinical manifestations whose precise mechanisms of disease are presently unknown. We created multiple cell lines each with different levels of reduction of expression of the gene coding for the type 2 variant of the disease, Tripeptidyl peptidase (Tpp1), in the cellular slime mould <i>Dictyostelium discoideum.</i> Knocking down Tpp1 in <i>Dictyostelium</i> resulted in the accumulation of autofluorescent material, a characteristic trait of Batten disease. Phenotypic characterisation of the mutants revealed phenotypic deficiencies in growth and development, whilst endocytic uptake of nutrients was enhanced. Furthermore, the severity of the phenotypes correlated with the expression levels of Tpp1. We propose that the phenotypic defects are due to altered Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling. We show that treatment of wild type <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells with rapamycin (a specific TOR complex inhibitor) or antisense inhibition of expression of Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in the brain) (an upstream TOR complex activator) phenocopied the Tpp1 mutants. We also show that overexpression of Rheb rescued the defects caused by antisense inhibition of Tpp1. These results suggest that the TOR signalling pathway is responsible for the cytopathological outcomes in the <i>Dictyostelium</i> Tpp1 model of Batten disease.",

        "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is the causative agent of a variety of severe infections. Many K. pneumoniae strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and this situation creates a need for new antibacterial molecules. K. pneumoniae pathogenicity relies largely on its ability to escape phagocytosis and intracellular killing by phagocytic cells. Interfering with these escape mechanisms may allow to decrease bacterial virulence and to combat infections. In this study, we used Dictyostelium discoideum as a model phagocyte to screen a collection of 1,099 chemical compounds. Phg1A KO D. discoideum cells cannot feed upon K. pneumoniae bacteria, unless bacteria bear mutations decreasing their virulence. We identified 3 non-antibiotic compounds that restored growth of phg1A KO cells on K. pneumoniae, and we characterized the mode of action of one of them, 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (K2). K2-treated bacteria were more rapidly killed in D. discoideum phagosomes than non-treated bacteria. They were more sensitive to polymyxin and their outer membrane was more accessible to a hydrophobic fluorescent probe. These results suggest that K2 acts by rendering the membrane of K. pneumoniae accessible to antibacterial effectors. K2 was effective on three different K. pneumoniae strains, and acted at concentrations as low as 3 \u03bcM. K2 has previously been used to treat viral infections but its precise molecular mechanism of action in K. pneumoniae remains to be determined.",

        "abstract": "Multinucleate cells of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> divide usually by unilateral cleavage furrows that ingress from the cell border. Along their path into the cell, they follow regions that are rich in myosin II and cortexillin and leave out the areas around the spindle poles that are populated with microtubule asters. In cells of a <i>D. discoideum</i> mutant that remain spread during mitosis we observed, as a rare event, cleavage by the expansion of a hole that is initiated in the middle of the cell area and has no connection with the cell's periphery. Here we show that these ring-shaped furrows develop in two phases, the first being reversible. During the first phase, the dorsal and ventral cell cortices come in close apposition and the cell membrane detaches locally from the substrate surface. The second phase comprises formation of the hole by membrane fusion and expansion of the opening toward the border of the cell, eventually cutting the multinucleate cell into pieces. We address the three-dimensional organization of ring-shaped furrows, their interaction with lateral furrows, and their association with filamentous myosin II and cortexillin. Thus, despite their geometrical divergence, similar molecular mechanisms might link the expanding hole to the standard contractile ring.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is a unicellular eukaryote that eats bacteria, and eventually outgrows the bacteria. D. discoideum cells accumulate extracellular polyphosphate (polyP), and the polyP concentration increases as the local cell density increases. At high cell densities, the correspondingly high extracellular polyP concentrations allow cells to sense that they are about to outgrow their food supply and starve, causing the D. discoideum cells to inhibit their proliferation. In this report, we show that high extracellular polyP inhibits exocytosis of undigested or partially digested nutrients. PolyP decreases plasma membrane recycling and apparent cell membrane fluidity, and this requires the G protein-coupled polyP receptor GrlD, the polyphosphate kinase Ppk1 and the inositol hexakisphosphate kinase I6kA. PolyP alters protein contents in detergent-insoluble crude cytoskeletons, but does not significantly affect random cell motility, cell speed or F-actin levels. Together, these data suggest that D. discoideum cells use polyP as a signal to sense their local cell density and reduce cell membrane fluidity and membrane recycling, perhaps as a mechanism to retain ingested food when the cells are about to starve.

        "abstract": "Micro (mi)RNAs regulate gene expression in many eukaryotic organisms where they control diverse biological processes. Their biogenesis, from primary transcripts to mature miRNAs, have been extensively characterized in animals and plants, showing distinct differences between these phylogenetically distant groups of organisms. However, comparably little is known about miRNA biogenesis in organisms whose evolutionary position is placed in between plants and animals and/or in unicellular organisms. Here, we investigate miRNA maturation in the unicellular amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, belonging to Amoebozoa, which branched out after plants but before animals. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs and poly(A)-selected RNAs demonstrated that the Dicer-like protein DrnB is required, and essentially specific, for global miRNA maturation in D. discoideum. Our RNA-seq data also showed that longer miRNA transcripts, generally preceded by a T-rich putative promoter motif, accumulate in a drnB knock-out strain. For two model miRNAs we defined the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of primary (pri)-miRNAs and showed that they carry the RNA polymerase II specific m<sup>7</sup>G-cap. The generation of the 3'-ends of these pri-miRNAs differs, with pri-mir-1177 reading into the downstream gene, and pri-mir-1176 displaying a distinct end. This 3\u00b4-end is processed to shorter intermediates, stabilized in DrnB-depleted cells, of which some carry a short oligo(A)-tail. Furthermore, we identified 10 new miRNAs, all DrnB dependent and developmentally regulated. Thus, the miRNA machinery in D. discoideum shares features with both plants and animals, which is in agreement with its evolutionary position and perhaps also an adaptation to its complex lifestyle: unicellular growth and multicellular development.",

We found that the proliferation of cells lacking CnrN, a phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-like phosphatase, is not inhibited by exogenous AprA and is increased by exogenous CfaD. The expression of CnrN in cnrN cells partially rescues these altered sensitivities, suggesting that CnrN is necessary for the ability of AprA and CfaD to inhibit proliferation. Cells lacking CnrN accumulate normal levels of AprA and CfaD. Like cells lacking AprA and CfaD, cnrN cells proliferate faster and reach a higher maximum cell density than wild type cells, tend to be multinucleate, accumulate normal levels of mass and protein per nucleus, and form less viable spores. When cnrN cells expressing myc-tagged CnrN are stimulated with a mixture of rAprA and rCfaD, levels of membrane-associated myc-CnrN increase. AprA also causes chemorepulsion of Dictyostelium cells, and CnrN is required for this process. Combined, these results suggest that CnrN functions in a signal transduction pathway downstream of AprA and CfaD mediating some, but not all, of the effects of AprA and CfaD.",

The protein contains an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A (vWFA)-like motif and is therefore named VwkA. Manipulation of VwkA expression level via high copy number plasmids (VwkA++ cells) or gene disruption (vwkA null cells) results in an array of cellular defects, including impaired growth and multinucleation in suspension culture, impaired development, and alterations in myosin II abundance and assembly. Despite sequence similarity to MHCKs, the purified protein failed to phosphorylate myosin II in vitro. Autophosphorylation activity, however, was enhanced by calcium/calmodulin, and the enzyme can be precipitated from cellular lysates with calmodulin-agarose, suggesting that VwkA may directly bind calmodulin. VwkA is cytosolic in distribution but enriched on the membranes of the contractile vacuole and Golgi-like structures in the cell. We propose that VwkA likely acts indirectly to influence myosin II abundance and assembly behavior and possibly has broader roles than previously characterized alpha kinases in this organism, which all seem to be MHCKs.",

        "abstract": "The Dictyostelium protein kinase YakA is required for the growth-to-development transition. During growth YakA controls the cell cycle, regulating the intervals between cell divisions. When starved for nutrients Dictyostelium cells arrest growth and undergo changes in gene expression, decreasing vegetative mRNAs and inducing the expression of pkaC. YakA is an effector of these changes, being necessary for the decrease of vegetative mRNA expression and the increase of protein kinase A (PKA) activity that will ultimately regulate expression of adenylyl cyclase, cAMP synthesis, and the induction of development. We report a role for this kinase in the response to nitrosoative or oxidative stress of Dictyostelium cells. Hydrogen peroxide and sodium nitroprusside arrest the growth of cells and trigger cAMP synthesis and activation of PKA in a manner similar to the well-established response to nutrient starvation. We have found that yakA null cells are hypersensitive to nitrosoative/oxidative stress and that a second-site mutation in pkaC suppresses this sensitivity. The response to different stresses has been investigated and YakA, cAMP, and PKA have been identified as components of the pathway that regulate the growth arrest that follows treatment with compounds that generate reactive oxygen species. The effect of different types of stress was evaluated in Dictyostelium and the YakA/PKA pathway was also implicated in the response to heat stress.",

Though cell division is considered a well-ordered sequence of biochemical events, cytokinesis, an inherently mechanical process, must also be mechanically controlled to ensure that two equivalent daughter cells are produced with high fidelity. Given that cells respond to their mechanical environment, we hypothesized that cells utilize mechanosensing and mechanical feedback to sense and correct shape asymmetries during cytokinesis. Because the mitotic spindle and myosin II are vital to cell division, we explored their roles in responding to shape perturbations during cell division. We demonstrate that the contractile proteins myosin II and cortexillin I redistribute in response to intrinsic and externally induced shape asymmetries. In early cytokinesis, mechanical load overrides spindle cues and slows cytokinesis progression while contractile proteins accumulate and correct shape asymmetries. In late cytokinesis, mechanical perturbation also directs contractile proteins but without apparently disrupting cytokinesis. Significantly, this response only occurs during anaphase through cytokinesis, does not require microtubules, and is independent of spindle orientation, but is dependent on myosin II. Our data provide evidence for a mechanosensory system that directs contractile proteins to regulate cell shape during mitosis.",

The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is used as a model host to study the pathogenic mechanisms that Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease, uses to kill eukaryotic cells. Here we show that the infection of D. discoideum by L. pneumophila results in a decrease in mitochondrial messenger RNAs, beginning more than 8 hours prior to detectable host cell death. These changes can be mimicked by hydrogen peroxide treatment, but not by other cytotoxic agents. The mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) is also cleaved at three specific sites during the course of infection. Two LSU rRNA fragments appear first, followed by smaller fragments produced by additional cleavage events. The initial LSU rRNA cleavage site is predicted to be on the surface of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, while two secondary sites map to the predicted interface with the small subunit. No LSU rRNA cleavage was observed after exposure of D. discoideum to hydrogen peroxide, or other cytotoxic chemicals that kill cells in a variety of ways. Functional L. pneumophila type II and type IV secretion systems are required for the cleavage, establishing a correlation between the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila and D. discoideum LSU rRNA destruction. LSU rRNA cleavage was not observed in L. pneumophila infections of Acanthamoeba castellanii or human U937 cells, suggesting that L. pneumophila uses distinct mechanisms to interrupt metabolism in different hosts. Thus, L. pneumophila infection of D. discoideum results in dramatic decrease of mitochondrial RNAs, and in the specific cleavage of mitochondrial rRNA. The predicted location of the cleavage sites on the mitochondrial ribosome suggests that rRNA destruction is initiated by a specific sequence of events. These findings suggest that L. pneumophila specifically disrupts mitochondrial protein synthesis in D. discoideum during the course of infection.",

In this review, we describe work on three different cell-density sensing systems used by Dictyostelium. The first involves a negative feedback loop in which two secreted signals inhibit cell proliferation during the growth phase. As the cell density increases, the concentrations of the secreted factors concomitantly increase, allowing the cells to sense their density. The two signals act as message authenticators for each other, and the existence of two different signals that require each other for activity may explain why previous efforts to identify autocrine proliferation-inhibiting signals in higher eukaryotes have generally failed. The second system involves a signal made by growing cells that is secreted only when they starve. This then allows cells to sense the density of just the starving cells, and is an example of a mechanism that allows cells in a tissue to sense the density of one specific cell type. The third cell density counting system involves cells in aggregation streams secreting a signal that limits the size of fruiting bodies. Computer simulations predicted, and experiments then showed, that the factor increases random cell motility and decreases cell-cell adhesion to cause streams to break up if there are too many cells in the stream. Together, studies on Dictyostelium cell density counting systems will help elucidate how higher eukaryotes regulate the size and composition of tissues.",

        "abstract": "We have identified a novel gene, Tortoise (TorA), that is required for the efficient chemotaxis of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Cells lacking TorA sense chemoattractant gradients as indicated by the presence of periodic waves of cell shape changes and the localized translocation of cytosolic PH domains to the membrane. However, they are unable to migrate directionally up spatial gradients of cAMP. Cells lacking Mek1 display a similar phenotype. Overexpression of Mek1 in torA- partially restores chemotaxis, whereas overexpression of TorA in mek1- does not rescue the chemotactic phenotype. Regardless of the genetic background, TorA overexpressing cells stop growing when separated from a substrate. Surprisingly, TorA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) is clustered near one end of mitochondria. Deletion analysis of the TorA protein reveals distinct regions for chemotactic function, mitochondrial localization, and the formation of clusters. TorA is associated with a round structure within the mitochondrion that shows enhanced staining with the mitochondrial dye Mitotracker. Cells overexpressing TorA contain many more of these structures than do wild-type cells. These TorA-containing structures resist extraction with Triton X-100, which dissolves the mitochondria. The characterization of TorA demonstrates an unexpected link between mitochondrial function, the chemotactic response, and the capacity to grow in suspension.",

        "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), collectively known as Batten disease, are a group of neurological diseases that affect all ages and ethnicities worldwide. There are 13 different subtypes of NCL, each caused by a mutation in a distinct gene. The NCLs are characterized by the accumulation of undigestible lipids and proteins in various cell types. This leads to progressive neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms including vision loss, progressive motor and cognitive decline, seizures, and premature death. These diseases have commonly been characterized by lysosomal defects leading to the accumulation of undigestible material but further research on the NCLs suggests that altered protein secretion may also play an important role. This has been strengthened by recent work in biomedical model organisms, including Dictyostelium discoideum, mice, and sheep. Research in D. discoideum has reported the extracellular localization of some NCL-related proteins and the effects of NCL-related gene loss on protein secretion during unicellular growth and multicellular development. Aberrant protein secretion has also been observed in mammalian models of NCL, which has allowed examination of patient-derived cerebrospinal fluid and urine for potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Accumulated evidence links seven of the 13 known NCL-related genes to protein secretion, suggesting that altered secretion is a common hallmark of multiple NCL subtypes. This Review highlights the impact of altered protein secretion in the NCLs, identifies potential biomarkers of interest and suggests that future work in this area can provide new therapeutic insight.",

        "abstract": "Hirano bodies are cytoplasmic inclusions composed mainly of actin and actin-associated proteins. The formation of Hirano bodies during various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been reported. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to the formation of these inclusions in the brain are not known, expression of the C-terminal fragment (CT) (amino acids 124 to 295) from the endogenous 34-kDa actin-binding protein of Dictyostelium discoideum leads to the formation of actin inclusions in vivo. In the current study, we report the development of an inducible expression system to study the early phases of Hirano body formation using an inducible promoter system (rnrB). By fusing the CT to a green fluorescent protein (CT-GFP), we monitored protein expression and localization by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. We observed an increase in the number and size of inclusions formed following induction of the CT-GFP vector system. Time-lapse microscopy studies revealed that the CT-GFP foci associated with the cell cortex and fused to form a single large aggregate. Transmission electron microscopy further demonstrates that these inclusions have a highly ordered ultrastructure, a pathological hallmark of Hirano bodies observed in postmortem brain samples from patients with various neurodegenerative disorders. Collectively, this system provides a method to visualize and characterize the events that surround early actin inclusion formation in a eukaryotic model.",

        "abstract": "The Amoebozoan <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> exhibits a semi-closed mitosis in which the nuclear membranes remain intact but become permeabilized to allow tubulin and spindle assembly factors to access the nuclear interior. Previous work indicated that this is accomplished at least by partial disassembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Further contributions by the insertion process of the duplicating, formerly cytosolic, centrosome into the nuclear envelope and nuclear envelope fenestrations forming around the central spindle during karyokinesis were discussed. We studied the behavior of several <i>Dictyostelium</i> nuclear envelope, centrosomal, and nuclear pore complex (NPC) components tagged with fluorescence markers together with a nuclear permeabilization marker (NLS-TdTomato) by live-cell imaging. We could show that permeabilization of the nuclear envelope during mitosis occurs in synchrony with centrosome insertion into the nuclear envelope and partial disassembly of nuclear pore complexes. Furthermore, centrosome duplication takes place after its insertion into the nuclear envelope and after initiation of permeabilization. Restoration of nuclear envelope integrity usually occurs long after re-assembly of NPCs and cytokinesis has taken place and is accompanied by a concentration of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components at both sites of nuclear envelope fenestration (centrosome and central spindle).",

        "abstract": "The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, Legionella pneumophila, replicates in amoebae and macrophages in a distinct membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). LCV formation is governed by the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system that translocates ~300 different \"effector\" proteins into host cells. Some of the translocated effectors anchor to the LCV membrane via phosphoinositide (PI) lipids. Here, we use the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, producing fluorescent PI probes, to analyze the LCV PI dynamics by live-cell imaging. Upon uptake of wild-type or Icm/Dot-deficient L. pneumophila, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 transiently accumulated for an average of 40 s on early phagosomes, which acquired PtdIns(3)P within 1 min after uptake. Whereas phagosomes containing \u0394icmT mutant bacteria remained decorated with PtdIns(3)P, more than 80% of wild-type LCVs gradually lost this PI within 2 h. The process was accompanied by a major rearrangement of PtdIns(3)P-positive membranes condensing to the cell center. PtdIns(4)P transiently localized to early phagosomes harboring wild-type or \u0394icmT L. pneumophila and was cleared within minutes after uptake. During the following 2 h, PtdIns(4)P steadily accumulated only on wild-type LCVs, which maintained a discrete PtdIns(4)P identity spatially separated from calnexin-positive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for at least 8 h. The separation of PtdIns(4)P-positive and ER membranes was even more pronounced for LCVs harboring \u0394sidC-sdcA mutant bacteria defective for ER recruitment, without affecting initial bacterial replication in the pathogen vacuole. These findings elucidate the temporal and spatial dynamics of PI lipids implicated in LCV formation and provide insight into host cell membrane and effector protein interactions.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system are the two major processes for the clearance and recycling of proteins and organelles in eukaryotic cells. Evidence is accumulating that there is extensive crosstalk between the two pathways, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We previously found that autophagy 9 (ATG9) and 16 (ATG16) proteins are crucial for full proteasomal activity in the unicellular amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. In comparison to AX2 wild-type cells, ATG9<sup>-</sup>and ATG16<sup>-</sup> cells displayed a 60%, and ATG9<sup>-</sup>/16<sup>-</sup> cells a 90%, decrease in proteasomal activity. Mutant cells also showed a significant increase in poly-ubiquitinated proteins and contained large ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates. Here, we focus on possible reasons for these results. Reanalysis of published tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic results of AX2, ATG9<sup>-</sup>, ATG16<sup>-</sup>, and ATG9<sup>-</sup>/16<sup>-</sup> cells revealed no change in the abundance of proteasomal subunits. To identify possible differences in proteasome-associated proteins, we generated AX2 wild-type and ATG16<sup>-</sup> cells expressing the 20S proteasomal subunit PSMA4 as GFP-tagged fusion protein, and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by mass spectrometric analysis. The results revealed no significant differences in the abundance of proteasomes between the two strains. However, we found enrichment as well as depletion of proteasomal regulators and differences in the ubiquitination of associated proteins for ATG16<sup>-</sup>, as compared to AX2 cells. Recently, proteaphagy has been described as a means to replace non-functional proteasomes. We propose that autophagy-deficient <i>D. discoideum</i> mutants suffer from inefficient proteaphagy, which results in the accumulation of modified, less-active, and also of inactive, proteasomes. As a consequence, these cells exhibit a dramatic decrease in proteasomal activity and deranged protein homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "Many biological and physiological processes depend upon directed migration of cells, which is typically mediated by chemical or physical gradients or by signal relay. Here we show that cells can be guided in a single preferred direction based solely on local asymmetries in nano/microtopography on subcellular scales. These asymmetries can be repeated, and thereby provide directional guidance, over arbitrarily large areas. The direction and strength of the guidance is sensitive to the details of the nano/microtopography, suggesting that this phenomenon plays a context-dependent role in vivo. We demonstrate that appropriate asymmetric nano/microtopography can unidirectionally bias internal actin polymerization waves and that cells move with the same preferred direction as these waves. This phenomenon is observed both for the pseudopod-dominated migration of the amoeboid Dictyostelium discoideum and for the lamellipod-driven migration of human neutrophils. The conservation of this mechanism across cell types and the asymmetric shape of many natural scaffolds suggest that actin-wave-based guidance is important in biology and physiology.",

        "abstract": "Phagocytosis and macropinocytosis are Ras-regulated and actin-driven processes that depend on the dynamic rearrangements of the plasma membrane that protrudes and internalizes extracellular material by cup-shaped structures. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying actin assembly in large-scale endocytosis remain elusive. Here, we show that the Diaphanous-related formin G (ForG) from the professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum localizes to endocytic cups. Biochemical analyses revealed that ForG is a rather weak nucleator but efficiently elongates actin filaments in the presence of profilin. Notably, genetic inactivation of ForG is associated with a strongly impaired endocytosis and a markedly diminished F-actin content at the base of the cups. By contrast, ablation of the Arp2/3 (actin-related protein-2/3) complex activator SCAR (suppressor of cAMP receptor) diminishes F-actin mainly at the cup rim, being consistent with its known localization. These data therefore suggest that ForG acts as an actin polymerase of Arp2/3-nucleated filaments to allow for efficient membrane expansion and engulfment of extracellular material. Finally, we show that ForG is directly regulated in large-scale endocytosis by RasB and RasG, which are highly related to the human proto-oncogene KRas.",

        "abstract": "Migrating cells can extend their leading edge by forming myosin-driven blebs and F-actin-driven pseudopods. When coerced to migrate in resistive environments, Dictyostelium cells switch from using predominately pseudopods to blebs. Bleb formation has been shown to be chemotactic and can be influenced by the direction of the chemotactic gradient. In this study, we determine the blebbing responses of developed cells of Dictyostelium discoideum to cAMP gradients of varying steepness produced in microfluidic channels with different confining heights, ranging between 1.7 \u03bcm and 3.8 \u03bcm. We show that microfluidic confinement height, gradient steepness, buffer osmolarity and Myosin II activity are important factors in determining whether cells migrate with blebs or with pseudopods. Dictyostelium cells were observed migrating within the confines of microfluidic gradient channels. When the cAMP gradient steepness is increased from 0.7 nM/\u03bcm to 20 nM/\u03bcm, cells switch from moving with a mixture of blebs and pseudopods to moving only using blebs when chemotaxing in channels with confinement heights less than 2.4 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the size of the blebs increases with gradient steepness and correlates with increases in myosin-II localization at the cell cortex. Reduction of intracellular pressure by high osmolarity buffer or inhibition of myosin-II by blebbistatin leads to a decrease in bleb formation and bleb size. Together, our data reveal that the protrusion type formed by migrating cells can be influenced by the channel height and the steepness of the cAMP gradient, and suggests that a combination of confinement-induced myosin-II localization and cAMP-regulated cortical contraction leads to increased intracellular fluid pressure and bleb formation.",

They all contain four independently folded Calponin Homology-domains and an N-terminal headpiece that is comprised of two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs. Since calcium-binding has been shown to be integral to regulating the activity of the three mammalian plastin proteins, we decided to study the properties of the headpiece regions of fimbrins from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Of these protein domains only the FimA headpiece from the amoeba protein possesses calcium binding properties. Structural characterization of this protein domain by multidimensional NMR and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicates that this EF-hand region of FimA also contains a regulatory 'switch helix' that is essential to regulating the activity of the human L-plastin protein. Interestingly this regulatory helical region seems to be lacking in the plant and yeast proteins and in fimbrins from all other nonmotile systems. Typical calmodulin antagonists can displace the switch-helix from the FimA headpiece, suggesting that such drugs can deregulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulation of the actin-bunding in the amoeba, thereby making it a useful organism for drug screening against mammalian plastins.",

Genome sequencing studies have revealed a remarkable array of genes homologous to polyketide synthases (PKSs) that are known to synthesize secondary metabolites in bacteria and fungi. A crucial step in functional activation of PKSs involves their post-translational modification catalyzed by phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases). PPTases have been recently characterized from several bacteria; however, their relevance in complex life cycle of protozoa remains largely unexplored. Here we have identified and characterized two phosphopantetheinyl transferases from D. discoideum that exhibit distinct functional specificity. DiAcpS specifically modifies a stand-alone acyl carrier protein (ACP) that possesses a mitochondrial import signal. DiSfp in contrast is specific to Type I multifunctional PKS/fatty acid synthase proteins and cannot modify the stand-alone ACP. The mRNA of two PPTases can be detected during the vegetative as well as starvation-induced developmental pathway and the disruption of either of these genes results in non-viable amoebae. Our studies show that both PPTases play an important role in Dictyostelium biology and provide insight into the importance of PPTases in lower eukaryotes.",

Soil amoebae are simple eukaryotic organisms and as such could be particularly good for understanding how eukaryote microbiomes originate and are maintained. One such amoeba, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, has both permanent and temporary associations with bacteria. Here we focus on culturable bacterial associates in order to interrogate their relationship with <i>D. discoideum</i>. To do this, we isolated over 250 <i>D. discoideum</i> fruiting body samples from soil and deer feces at Mountain Lake Biological Station. In one-third of the wild <i>D. discoideum</i> we tested, one to six bacterial species were found per fruiting body sorus (spore mass) for a total of 174 bacterial isolates. The remaining two-thirds of <i>D. discoideum</i> fruiting body samples did not contain culturable bacteria, as is thought to be the norm. A majority (71.4%) of the unique bacterial haplotypes are in Proteobacteria. The rest are in either Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, or Firmicutes. The highest bacterial diversity was found in <i>D. discoideum</i> fruiting bodies originating from deer feces (27 OTUs), greater than either of those originating in shallow (11 OTUs) or in deep soil (4 OTUs). Rarefaction curves and the Chao1 estimator for species richness indicated the diversity in any substrate was not fully sampled, but for soil it came close. A majority of the <i>D. discoideum</i>-associated bacteria were edible by <i>D. discoideum</i> and supported its growth (75.2% for feces and 81.8% for soil habitats). However, we found several bacteria genera were able to evade phagocytosis and persist in <i>D. discoideum</i> cells through one or more social cycles. This study focuses not on the entire <i>D. discoideum</i> microbiome, but on the culturable subset of bacteria that have important eukaryote interactions as prey, symbionts, or pathogens. These eukaryote and bacteria interactions may provide fertile ground for investigations of bacteria using amoebas to gain an initial foothold in eukaryotes and of the origins of symbiosis and simple microbiomes.",

        "abstract": "G-proteins, kinesins, and myosins are hydrolases that utilize a common protein fold and divalent metal cofactor (typically Mg(2+)) to coordinate purine nucleotide hydrolysis. The nucleoside triphosphorylase activities of these enzymes are activated through allosteric communication between the nucleotide-binding site and the activator/effector/polymer interface to convert the free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis into molecular switching (G-proteins) or force generation (kinesins and myosin). We have investigated the ATPase mechanisms of wild-type and the S237C mutant of non-muscle myosin II motor from Dictyostelium discoideum. The S237C substitution occurs in the conserved metal-interacting switch-1, and we show that this substitution modulates the actomyosin interaction based on the divalent metal present in solution. Surprisingly, S237C shows rapid basal steady-state Mg(2+)- or Mn(2+)-ATPase kinetics, but upon binding actin, its MgATPase is inhibited. This actin inhibition is relieved by Mn(2+), providing a direct and experimentally reversible linkage of switch-1 and the actin-binding cleft through the swapping of divalent metals in the reaction. Using pyrenyl-labeled F-actin, we demonstrate that acto\u00b7S237C undergoes slow and weak MgATP binding, which limits the rate of steady-state catalysis. Mn(2+) rescues this effect to near wild-type activity. 2'(3')-O-(N-Methylanthraniloyl)-ADP release experiments show the need for switch-1 interaction with the metal cofactor for tight ADP binding. Our results are consistent with strong reciprocal coupling of nucleoside triphosphate and F-actin binding and provide additional evidence for the allosteric communication pathway between the nucleotide-binding site and the filament-binding region.",

        "abstract": "Cells are perpetually challenged by pathogens, protein aggregates or chemicals, that induce plasma membrane or endolysosomal compartments damage. This severe stress is recognised and controlled by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and the autophagy machineries, which are recruited to damaged membranes to either repair or to remove membrane remnants. Yet, insight is limited about how damage is sensed and which effectors lead to extensive tagging of the damaged organelles with signals, such as K63-polyubiquitin, required for the recruitment of membrane repair or removal machineries. To explore the key factors responsible for detection and marking of damaged compartments, we use the professional phagocyte <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. We found an evolutionary conserved E3-ligase, TrafE, that is robustly recruited to intracellular compartments disrupted after infection with <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> or after sterile damage caused by chemical compounds. TrafE acts at the intersection of ESCRT and autophagy pathways and plays a key role in functional recruitment of the ESCRT subunits ALIX, Vps32 and Vps4 to damage sites. Importantly, we show that the absence of TrafE severely compromises the xenophagy restriction of mycobacteria as well as ESCRT-mediated and autophagy-mediated endolysosomal membrane damage repair, resulting in early cell death.",

Although we have reported that transient introduction of all-in-one vectors that express both Cas9 and sgRNAs can efficiently induce multiple gene knockouts in Dictyostelium discoideum, concerns remain about off-target effects and false-positive amplification during mutation detection via PCR. To minimise these effects, we modified the system to permit gene deletions of greater than 1 kb via use of paired sgRNAs and Cas9 nickase. An all-in-one vector expressing the Cas9 nickase and sgRNAs was transiently introduced into D. discoideum, and the resulting mutants showed long deletions with a relatively high efficiency of 10-30%. By further improving the vector, a new dual sgRNA expression vector was also constructed to allow simultaneous insertion of two sgRNAs via one-step cloning. By applying this system, precise point mutations and genomic deletions were generated in the target locus via simultaneous introduction of the vector and a single-stranded oligonucleotide template without integrating a drug resistance cassette. These systems enable simple and straightforward genome editing that requires high specificity, and they can serve as an alternative to the conventional homologous recombination-based gene disruption method in D. discoideum.",

        "abstract": "Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is expressed ubiquitously and is involved in many eukaryotic cellular functions, although PP1 enzyme activity could not be detected in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum cell extracts. In the present paper, we show that D. discoideum has a single copy gene that codes for the catalytic subunit of PP1 (DdPP1c). DdPP1c is expressed throughout the D. discoideum life cycle with constant levels of mRNA, and its protein and amino acid sequence show a mean identity of 80% with other PP1c enzymes. However, it has a distinctive difference: the substitution of a phenylalanine residue (Phe(269) in the DdPP1c) for a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys(273) in rabbit PP1c) in a region that was shown to have a critical role in the interaction of rabbit PP1c with toxin inhibitors. Wild-type DdPP1c and an engineered mutant form in which Phe(269) was replaced by a cysteine residue were expressed in Escherichia coli. Both recombinant activities were similarly inhibited by okadaic acid, tautomycin and microcystin. However, the Phe(269)-->Cys mutation resulted in a large increase in enzyme activity towards phosphorylase a and a higher sensitivity to calyculin A. These results, together with the molecular modelling of DdPP1c structure, indicate that the Phe(269) residue, which occurs naturally in D. discoideum, confers distinct biochemical properties on this enzyme.",

        "abstract": "The capacity of living cells to sense their population density and to migrate accordingly is essential for the regulation of many physiological processes. However, the mechanisms used to achieve such functions are poorly known. Here, based on the analysis of multiple trajectories of vegetative <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells, we investigate such a system extensively. We show that the cells secrete a high-molecular-weight quorum-sensing factor (QSF) in their medium. This extracellular signal induces, in turn, a reduction of the cell movements, in particular, through the downregulation of a mode of motility with high persistence time. This response appears independent of cAMP and involves a G-protein-dependent pathway. Using a mathematical analysis of the cells' response function, we evidence a negative feedback on the QSF secretion, which unveils a powerful generic mechanism for the cells to detect when they exceed a density threshold. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive and dynamical view of this system enabling cells in a scattered population to adapt their motion to their neighbours without physical contact.",

        "abstract": "Low-glucose and -insulin conditions, associated with ketogenic diets, can reduce the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, potentially leading to a range of positive medical and health-related effects. Here, we determined whether mTORC1 signaling is also a target for decanoic acid, a key component of the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet. Using a tractable model system, <i>Dictyostelium</i>, we show that decanoic acid can decrease mTORC1 activity, under conditions of constant glucose and in the absence of insulin, measured by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). We determine that this effect of decanoic acid is dependent on a ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing protein, mediating inhibition of a conserved <i>Dictyostelium</i> AAA ATPase, p97, a homolog of the human transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97) protein. We then demonstrate that decanoic acid decreases mTORC1 activity in the absence of insulin and under high-glucose conditions in ex vivo rat hippocampus and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patient-derived astrocytes. Our data therefore indicate that dietary decanoic acid may provide a new therapeutic approach to down-regulate mTORC1 signaling.",

The complexity of the N-glycomes of even glycosylation mutants is compounded by the occurrence of anionic modifications, which also present an analytical challenge. In this study, we have employed hydrophilic interaction anion exchange (HIAX) HPLC in combination with MALDI-TOF MS/MS to explore the anionic N-glycome of the M31 (modA) strain, which lacks endoplasmic reticulum \u03b1-glucosidase II, an enzyme conserved in most eukaryotes including Homo sapiens. Prefractionation with HIAX chromatography enabled the identification of N-glycans with unusual oligo-\u03b11,2-mannose extensions as well as others with up to four anionic modifications. Due to the use of hydrofluoric acid treatment, we were able to discriminate isobaric glycans differing in the presence of sulphate or phosphate on intersected structures as opposed to those carrying GlcNAc-phosphodiesters. The latter represent biosynthetic intermediates during the pathway leading to formation of the methylphosphorylated mannose epitope, which may have a similar function in intracellular targeting of hydrolases as the mannose-6-phosphate modification of lysosomal enzymes in mammals. In conclusion, HIAX in combination with MS is a highly sensitive approach for both fine separation and definition of neutral and anionic N-glycan structures.",

        "abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive pathway that restores cellular homeostasis after endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The ER-resident kinase/RNase Ire1 is the only UPR sensor conserved during evolution. Autophagy, a lysosomal degradative pathway, also contributes to the recovery of cell homeostasis after ER stress, but the interplay between these two pathways is still poorly understood. We describe the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> ER stress response and characterize its single bona fide Ire1 orthologue, IreA. We found that tunicamycin (TN) triggers a gene-expression reprogramming that increases the protein folding capacity of the ER and alleviates ER protein load. Further, IreA is required for cell survival after TN-induced ER stress and is responsible for nearly 40% of the transcriptional changes induced by TN. The response of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells to ER stress involves the combined activation of an IreA-dependent gene expression program and the autophagy pathway. These two pathways are independently activated in response to ER stress but, interestingly, autophagy requires IreA at a later stage for proper autophagosome formation. We propose that unresolved ER stress in cells lacking IreA causes structural alterations of the ER, leading to a late-stage blockade of autophagy clearance. This unexpected functional link may critically affect eukaryotic cell survival under ER stress.",

We screened approximately 450,000 clones from a slug-stage cDNA library for their ability to rescue the culmination defect when overexpressed. There were 12 multicopy suppressors of Dd-STATa, of which 4 encoded segments of a known noncoding RNA, dutA. Expression of dutA is specific to the pstA zone, the region where Dd-STATa is activated. In suppressed strains the expression patterns of several putative Dd-STATa target genes become similar to the wild-type strain. In addition, the amount of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Dd-STATa is significantly increased in the suppressed strain. These results indicate that partial copies of dutA may act upstream of Dd-STATa to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism.",

Of these, PI(3,5)P2 is one of the least well-understood, despite key roles in many endocytic pathways including phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. PI(3,5)P2 is generated by the phosphoinositide 5-kinase PIKfyve, which is critical for phagosomal digestion and antimicrobial activity. However PI(3,5)P2 dynamics and regulation remain unclear due to lack of reliable reporters. Using the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we identify SnxA as a highly selective PI(3,5)P2-binding protein and characterize its use as a reporter for PI(3,5)P2 in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells. Using GFP-SnxA, we demonstrate that Dictyostelium phagosomes and macropinosomes accumulate PI(3,5)P2 3 min after engulfment but are then retained differently, indicating pathway-specific regulation. We further find that PIKfyve recruitment and activity are separable and that PIKfyve activation stimulates its own dissociation. SnxA is therefore a new tool for reporting PI(3,5)P2 in live cells that reveals key mechanistic details of the role and regulation of PIKfyve/PI(3,5)P2.",

We discovered three phlp genes in Dictyostelium, each encoding a phosducin-like protein of a different group. Disruption of the phlp1 gene strongly impaired G-protein signalling, apparently due to mislocalization of Gbetagamma in phlp1-null cells. GFP-Gbeta and GFP-Ggamma are membrane associated in wild-type cells, but cytosolic in phlp1-null cells. Phlp2 disruption is lethal due to a synchronous collapse of the cells after 16-17 cell divisions. Phlp3 disruptants show no abnormal phenotype. These results establish a role for phosducin-like proteins in facilitating folding, localization or function of proteins, in addition to modulating G-protein signalling.",

The major site of PTEN action is the plasma membrane, where PIP3 is produced by PI3 kinases. However, the mechanism and functional importance of PTEN membrane recruitment are poorly defined. Using the heterologous expression system in which human PTEN is expressed in Dictyostelium discoideum, we defined the molecular mechanisms that regulate the membrane-binding site through inhibitory interactions with the phosphorylated C-terminal tail. In addition, we potentiated mechanisms that mediate PTEN membrane association and engineered an enhanced PTEN with increased tumor suppressor functions. Moreover, we identified a new class of cancer-associated PTEN mutations that are specifically defective in membrane association. In this review, we summarize recent advances in PTEN-membrane interactions and methods useful in addressing PTEN function.",

We have developed conditions under which the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects Dictyostelium discoideum, a genetically tractable eukaryotic organism. When D. discoideum is plated on nutrient agar plates with different P. aeruginosa strains, the bacteria form lawns on these plates with amoebae embedded in them. Virulent P. aeruginosa strains kill these amoebae and leave an intact bacterial lawn. A number of P. aeruginosa mutants have been identified that are avirulent in this assay. Amoebae feed on these bacteria and form plaques in their bacterial lawns. One avirulent mutant strain carries an insertional mutation in the lasR gene. LasR is a transcription factor that controls a number of virulence genes in a density-dependent fashion. Another class of avirulent P. aeruginosa mutants is defective in type III secretion. One mutant lacks the PscJ protein, a structural component of the secretion apparatus, suggesting that cytotoxins are injected into the D. discoideum cell. One of these cytotoxins is ExoU, and exoU mutants are avirulent toward D. discoideum. Complementation of the lasR and exoU mutations restores virulence. Therefore, P. aeruginosa uses conserved virulence pathways to kill D. discoideum.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains one of the major threats to public health worldwide. Given the prevalence of multi drug resistance (MDR) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, there is a strong need to develop new anti-mycobacterial drugs with modes of action distinct from classical antibiotics. Inhibitors of mycobacterial virulence might target new molecular processes and may represent a potential new therapeutic alternative. In this study, we used a Dictyostelium discoideum host model to assess virulence of Mycobacterium marinum and to identify compounds inhibiting mycobacterial virulence. Among 9995 chemical compounds, we selected 12 inhibitors of mycobacterial virulence that do not inhibit mycobacterial growth in synthetic medium. Further analyses revealed that 8 of them perturbed functions requiring an intact mycobacterial cell wall such as sliding motility, bacterial aggregation or cell wall permeability. Chemical analogs of two compounds were analyzed. Chemical modifications altered concomitantly their effect on sliding motility and on mycobacterial virulence, suggesting that the alteration of the mycobacterial cell wall caused the loss of virulence. We characterized further one of the selected compounds and found that it inhibited the ability of mycobacteria to replicate in infected cells. Together these results identify new antimycobacterial compounds that represent new tools to unravel the molecular mechanisms controlling mycobacterial pathogenicity. The isolation of compounds with anti-virulence activity is the first step towards developing new antibacterial treatments.",

In solution, <i>Dictyostelium</i> DyPA exists as a stable dimer with the side chain of Asp146 contributing to the stabilization of the dimer interface by extending the hydrogen bond network connecting two monomers.

The active site of <i>Dictyostelium</i> DyPA has a hexa-coordinated heme iron with a histidine residue at the proximal axial position and either an activated oxygen or CN<sup>-</sup> molecule at the distal axial position. Asp149 is in an optimal conformation to accept a proton from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during the formation of compound I. Two potential distal solvent channels and a conserved shallow pocket leading to the heme molecule were found in <i>Dictyostelium</i> DyPA.

Activated receptors stimulate heterotrimeric G-proteins, consisting of three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma. In Dictyostelium discoideum, cAMP binds to the cAMP receptor cAR1, which is coupled to the heterotrimer containing the Galpha2 subunit. These studies provide in vivo evidence as to how receptors influence the localization of the G-protein complex prior to and after ligand binding. Previous work has shown that the state of the heterotrimer could be monitored by changes in fluorescence (or F\u00f6rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the alpha2- and beta-subunits of D. discoideum. We now report the kinetics of G-protein activation as a loss of FRET prior to and after cAMP addition by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). We also performed photobleaching experiments to measure G-protein recovery times. Our data show that inactive and active G-proteins cycle between the cytosol and plasma membrane. These data suggest that cAR1 activation slows the membrane dissociation ('off') rate of the alpha2 subunit, while simultaneously promoting betagamma-subunit dissociation.",

To resolve the cell signalling mechanism that control sporulation, we use insertional mutagenesis of amoebas transformed with fusion constructs of spore genes and red fluorescent protein. We identified the defective gene in a mutant lacking spore gene expression as the autophagy gene Atg7. Directed knock-out of atg7 and of autophagy genes like atg5 and atg9 yielded a similar phenotype, with lack of viable spores and excessive differentiation of stalk cells. The atg7-, atg5- and atg9- cells were specifically defective in cAMP induction of prespore genes, but showed enhanced cAMP stimulation of prestalk genes at the same developmental stage. The lack of prespore gene induction in the autophagy mutants was not due to deleterious effects of loss of autophagy on known components of the cAMP pathway, such as cAMP receptors and their cAMP-induced phosphorylation and internalization, PKA and the transcription factors SpaA and GbfA, or to lack of NH<sub>3</sub> production by proteolysis, which was previously suggested to stimulate the spore pathway. Our continued mutagenesis approach is the most likely to yield the intriguing link between autophagy and prespore gene induction.",

        "abstract": "The mitotic spindle is generally considered the initiator of furrow ingression. However, recent studies suggest that furrows can form without spindles, particularly during asymmetric cell division. In Dictyostelium, the mechanoenzyme myosin II and the actin cross-linker cortexillin I form a mechanosensor that responds to mechanical stress, which could account for spindle-independent contractile protein recruitment. Here we show that the regulatory and contractility network composed of myosin II, cortexillin I, IQGAP2, kinesin-6 (kif12), and inner centromeric protein (INCENP) is a mechanical stress-responsive system. Myosin II and cortexillin I form the core mechanosensor, and mechanotransduction is mediated by IQGAP2 to kif12 and INCENP. In addition, IQGAP2 is antagonized by IQGAP1 to modulate the mechanoresponsiveness of the system, suggesting a possible mechanism for discriminating between mechanical and biochemical inputs. Furthermore, IQGAP2 is important for maintaining spindle morphology and kif12 and myosin II cleavage furrow recruitment. Cortexillin II is not directly involved in myosin II mechanosensitive accumulation, but without cortexillin I, cortexillin II's role in membrane-cortex attachment is revealed. Finally, the mitotic spindle is dispensable for the system. Overall, this mechanosensory system is structured like a control system characterized by mechanochemical feedback loops that regulate myosin II localization at sites of mechanical stress and the cleavage furrow.",

We analyze the origin of a novel developmental trait of Dictyostelid amoebae: the evolution of cAMP as a developmental chemoattractant. We show that cAMP's role of attracting starving amoebae arose through recruitment of a pathway that originally evolved to coordinate fruiting body morphogenesis. Orthologues of the high-affinity cAMP receptor (cAR), cAR1, were identified in a selection of species that span the Dictyostelid phylogeny. The cAR1 orthologue from the basal species Dictyostelium minutum restored aggregation and development when expressed in an aggregation-defective mutant of the derived species Dictyostelium discoideum that lacks high-affinity cARs, thus demonstrating that the D. minutum cAR is a fully functional cAR. cAR1 orthologues from basal species are expressed during fruiting body formation, and only this process, and not aggregation, was disrupted by abrogation of cAR1 function. This is in contrast to derived species, where cAR1 is also expressed during aggregation and critically regulates this process. Our data show that coordination of fruiting body formation is the ancestral function of extracellular cAMP signaling, whereas its derived role in aggregation evolved by recruitment of a preexisting pathway to an earlier stage of development. This most likely occurred by addition of distal cis-regulatory regions to existing cAMP signaling genes.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis is a dynamic cellular process, comprised of direction sensing, polarization and locomotion, that leads to the directed movement of eukaryotic cells along extracellular gradients. As a primary step in the response of an individual cell to a spatial stimulus, direction sensing has attracted numerous theoretical treatments aimed at explaining experimental observations in a variety of cell types. Here we propose a new model of direction sensing based on experiments using Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty). The model is built around a reaction-diffusion-translocation system that involves three main component processes: a signal detection step based on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) for cyclic AMP (cAMP), a transduction step based on a heterotrimetic G protein G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3, and an activation step of a monomeric G-protein Ras. The model can predict the experimentally-observed response of cells treated with latrunculin A, which removes feedback from downstream processes, under a variety of stimulus protocols. We show that [Formula: see text] cycling modulated by Ric8, a nonreceptor guanine exchange factor for [Formula: see text] in Dicty, drives multiple phases of Ras activation and leads to direction sensing and signal amplification in cAMP gradients. The model predicts that both [Formula: see text] and G\u03b2\u03b3 are essential for direction sensing, in that membrane-localized [Formula: see text], the activated GTP-bearing form of [Formula: see text], leads to asymmetrical recruitment of RasGEF and Ric8, while globally-diffusing G\u03b2\u03b3 mediates their activation. We show that the predicted response at the level of Ras activation encodes sufficient 'memory' to eliminate the 'back-of-the wave' problem, and the effects of diffusion and cell shape on direction sensing are also investigated. In contrast with existing LEGI models of chemotaxis, the results do not require a disparity between the diffusion coefficients of the Ras activator GEF and the Ras inhibitor GAP. Since the signal pathways we study are highly conserved between Dicty and mammalian leukocytes, the model can serve as a generic one for direction sensing.",

However, the mechanism by which Kif9 functions to link these two organelles remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that the Kif9 protein is localized to the nuclear envelope and is concentrated in the region underlying the centrosome point of attachment. Nuclear anchorage appears mediated through a specialized transmembrane domain located in the carboxyl terminus. Kif9 interacts with microtubules in in vitro binding assays and effects an endwise depolymerization of the polymer. These results suggest a model whereby Kif9 is anchored to the nucleus and generates a pulling force that reels the centrosome up against the nucleus. This is a novel activity for a kinesin motor, one important for progression of cells into mitosis and to ensure centrosome-nuclear parity in a multinuclear environment.",

In these cells, unilateral cleavage furrows are formed at spaces between areas that are controlled by aster microtubules. A peculiarity of unilateral cleavage furrows is their propensity to join laterally with other furrows into rings to form constrictions. This means cytokinesis is biphasic in multinucleate cells, the final abscission of daughter cells being independent of the initial direction of furrow progression. Myosin-II and the actin filament cross-linking protein cortexillin accumulate in unilateral furrows, as they do in the normal cleavage furrows of mononucleate cells. In a myosin-II-null background, multinucleate or mononucleate cells were produced by cultivation either in suspension or on an adhesive substrate. Myosin-II is not essential for cytokinesis either in mononucleate or in multinucleate cells but stabilizes and confines the position of the cleavage furrows. In fused wild-type cells, unilateral furrows ingress with an average velocity of 1.7 \u00b5m \u00d7 min<sup>-1</sup>, with no appreciable decrease of velocity in the course of ingression. In multinucleate myosin-II-null cells, some of the furrows stop growing, thus leaving space for the extensive broadening of the few remaining furrows.",

        "abstract": "Chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been a global health catastrophe, yet much about the CQ resistance (CQR) mechanism remains unclear. Hallmarks of the CQR phenotype include reduced accumulation of protonated CQ as a weak base in the digestive vacuole of the erythrocyte-stage parasite, and chemosensitization of CQ-resistant (but not CQ-sensitive) P. falciparum by agents such as verapamil. Mutations in the P. falciparum CQR transporter (PfCRT) confer CQR; particularly important among these mutations is the charge-loss substitution K\u2192T at position 76. Dictyostelium discoideum transformed with mutant PfCRT expresses key features of CQR including reduced drug accumulation and verapamil chemosensitization.",

        "abstract": "Chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria results from mutations in PfCRT, a member of a unique family of transporters present in apicomplexan parasites and Dictyostelium discoideum. Mechanisms that have been proposed to explain chloroquine resistance are difficult to evaluate within malaria parasites. Here we report on the targeted expression of wild-type and mutant forms of PfCRT to acidic vesicles in D. discoideum. We show that wild-type PfCRT has minimal effect on the accumulation of chloroquine by D. discoideum, whereas forms of PfCRT carrying a key charge-loss mutation of lysine 76 (e.g. K76T) enable D. discoideum to expel chloroquine. As in P. falciparum, the chloroquine resistance phenotype conferred on transformed D. discoideum can be reversed by the channel-blocking agent verapamil. Although intravesicular pH levels in D. discoideum show small acidic changes with the expression of different forms of PfCRT, these changes would tend to promote intravesicular trapping of chloroquine (a weak base) and do not account for reduced drug accumulation in transformed D. discoideum. Our results instead support outward-directed chloroquine efflux for the mechanism of chloroquine resistance by mutant PfCRT. This mechanism shows structural specificity as D. discoideum transformants that expel chloroquine do not expel piperaquine, a bisquinoline analog of chloroquine used frequently against chloroquine-resistant parasites in Southeast Asia. PfCRT, nevertheless, may have some ability to act on quinine and quinidine. Transformed D. discoideum will be useful for further studies of the chloroquine resistance mechanism and may assist in the development and evaluation of new antimalarial drugs.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). In <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, strains with mitochondrial dysfunction present consistent, AMPK-dependent phenotypes. This provides an opportunity to investigate if the loss of function of specific PD-associated genes produces cellular pathology by causing mitochondrial dysfunction with AMPK-mediated consequences. DJ-1 is a PD-associated, cytosolic protein with a conserved oxidizable cysteine residue that is important for the protein's ability to protect cells from the pathological consequences of oxidative stress. <i>Dictyostelium</i> DJ-1 (encoded by the gene <i>deeJ</i>) is located in the cytosol from where it indirectly inhibits mitochondrial respiration and also exerts a positive, nonmitochondrial role in endocytosis (particularly phagocytosis). Its loss in unstressed cells impairs endocytosis and causes correspondingly slower growth, while also stimulating mitochondrial respiration. We report here that oxidative stress in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells inhibits mitochondrial respiration and impairs phagocytosis in an AMPK-dependent manner. This adds to the separate impairment of phagocytosis caused by DJ-1 knockdown. Oxidative stress also combines with DJ-1 loss in an AMPK-dependent manner to impair or exacerbate defects in phototaxis, morphogenesis and growth. It thereby phenocopies mitochondrial dysfunction. These results support a model in which the oxidized but not the reduced form of DJ-1 inhibits AMPK in the cytosol, thereby protecting cells from the adverse consequences of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting AMPK hyperactivity.",

        "abstract": "The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system (T6SS) assembles as a molecular syringe that injects toxic protein effectors into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. We previously reported that the V. cholerae O37 serogroup strain V52 maintains a constitutively active T6SS to kill other Gram-negative bacteria while being immune to attack by kin bacteria. The pandemic O1 El Tor V. cholerae strain C6706 is T6SS-silent under laboratory conditions as it does not produce T6SS structural components and effectors, and fails to kill Escherichia coli prey. Yet, C6706 exhibits full resistance when approached by T6SS-active V52. These findings suggested that an active T6SS is not required for immunity against T6SS-mediated virulence. Here, we describe a dual expression profile of the T6SS immunity protein-encoding genes tsiV1, tsiV2, and tsiV3 that provides pandemic V. cholerae strains with T6SS immunity and allows T6SS-silent strains to maintain immunity against attacks by T6SS-active bacterial neighbors. The dual expression profile allows transcription of the three genes encoding immunity proteins independently of other T6SS proteins encoded within the same operon. One of these immunity proteins, TsiV2, protects against the T6SS effector VasX which is encoded immediately upstream of tsiV2. VasX is a secreted, lipid-binding protein that we previously characterized with respect to T6SS-mediated virulence towards the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Our data suggest the presence of an internal promoter in the open reading frame of vasX that drives expression of the downstream gene tsiV2. Furthermore, VasX is shown to act in conjunction with VasW, an accessory protein to VasX, to compromise the inner membrane of prokaryotic target cells. The dual regulatory profile of the T6SS immunity protein-encoding genes tsiV1, tsiV2, and tsiV3 permits V. cholerae to tightly control T6SS gene expression while maintaining immunity to T6SS activity.",

        "abstract": "Actin belongs to the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells which harbor usually many conventional actin isoforms as well as actin-related proteins (Arps). To get an overview over the sometimes confusing multitude of actins and Arps, we analyzed the Dictyostelium discoideum actinome in detail and compared it with the genomes from other model organisms. The D. discoideum actinome comprises 41 actins and actin-related proteins. The genome contains 17 actin genes which most likely arose from consecutive gene duplications, are all active, in some cases developmentally regulated and coding for identical proteins (Act8-group). According to published data, the actin fraction in a D. discoideum cell consists of more than 95% of these Act8-type proteins. The other 16 actin isoforms contain a conventional actin motif profile as well but differ in their protein sequences. Seven actin genes are potential pseudogenes. A homology search of the human genome using the most typical D. discoideum actin (Act8) as query sequence finds the major actin isoforms such as cytoplasmic beta-actin as best hit. This suggests that the Act8-group represents a nearly perfect actin throughout evolution. Interestingly, limited data from D. fasciculatum, a more ancient member among the social amoebae, show different relationships between conventional actins. The Act8-type isoform is most conserved throughout evolution. Modeling of the putative structures suggests that the majority of the actin-related proteins is functionally unrelated to canonical actin. The data suggest that the other actin variants are not necessary for the cytoskeleton itself but rather regulators of its dynamical features or subunits in larger protein complexes.",

Using the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, we find that cells lacking Katnip (Katanin interacting protein) have a general defect in lysosomal delivery and although they make autophagosomes and phagosomes correctly, cells are then unable to digest them. Katnip is largely unstudied yet highly conserved across evolution. Previously studies found that Katnip mutations in animals cause defects in cilia structure. Here we show that Katnip plays a more general role in maintaining microtubule function. We find that loss of Katnip has no overall effect on microtubule dynamics or organization, but is important for the transport and degradation of endocytic cargos. Strikingly, Katnip mutants become highly sensitive to GFP-tubulin expression, which leads to microtubule tangles, defective anaphase extension, and slow cell growth. Our findings establish a general role for Katnip in regulating microtubule function, beyond the roles previously described in cilia. We speculate this is via a key function in microtubule repair, needed to maintain endosomal trafficking and lysosomal degradation.",

        "abstract": "Several biological activities depend on iron-sulfur clusters ([Fe-S]). Even though they are well-known in several organisms their function and metabolic pathway were poorly understood in the majority of the organisms. We propose to use the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, as a biological model to study the biosynthesis of [Fe-S] at the molecular, cellular and organism levels. First, we have explored the <i>D. discoideum</i> genome looking for genes corresponding to the subunits that constitute the molecular machinery for Fe-S cluster assembly and, based on the structure of the mammalian supercomplex and amino acid conservation profiles, we inferred the full functionality of the amoeba machinery. After that, we expressed the recombinant mature form of <i>D. discoideum</i> frataxin protein (DdFXN), the kinetic activator of this pathway. We characterized the protein and its conformational stability. DdFXN is monomeric and compact. The analysis of the secondary structure content, calculated using the far-UV CD spectra, was compatible with the data expected for the FXN fold, and near-UV CD spectra were compatible with the data corresponding to a folded protein. In addition, Tryptophan fluorescence indicated that the emission occurs from an apolar environment. However, the conformation of DdFXN is significantly less stable than that of the human FXN, (4.0 vs. 9.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Based on a sequence analysis and structural models of DdFXN, we investigated key residues involved in the interaction of DdFXN with the supercomplex and the effect of point mutations on the energetics of the DdFXN tertiary structure. More than 10 residues involved in Friedreich's Ataxia are conserved between the human and DdFXN forms, and a good correlation between mutational effect on the energetics of both proteins were found, suggesting the existence of similar sequence/function/stability relationships. Finally, we integrated this information in an evolutionary context which highlights particular variation patterns between amoeba and humans that may reflect a functional importance of specific protein positions. Moreover, the complete pathway obtained forms a piece of evidence in favor of the hypothesis of a shared and highly conserved [Fe-S] assembly machinery between Human and <i>D. discoideum.</i>",

Cells overexpressing GbpD are flat, exhibit strongly increased cell-substrate attachment, and extend many bifurcated and lateral pseudopodia. Phg2, a serine/threonine-specific kinase, mediates Rap1-regulated cell-substrate adhesion, but not cell polarity or chemotaxis. In this study we demonstrate that overexpression of GbpD in pi3k1/2-null cells does not induce the adhesion and cell morphology phenotype. Furthermore we show that Rap1 directly binds to the Ras binding domain of PI3K, and overexpression of GbpD leads to strongly enhanced PIP3 levels. Consistently, upon overexpression of the PIP3-degradating enzyme PTEN in GbpD-overexpressing cells, the strong adhesion and cell morphology phenotype is largely lost. These results indicate that a GbpD/Rap/PI3K pathway helps control pseudopod formation and cell polarity.

It includes <i>B. pertussis</i>, a human-restricted pathogen that is the causative agent of Whooping Cough. In contrast, the closely related species <i>B. bronchiseptica</i> colonizes a broad range of animals as well as immunocompromised humans. Recent metagenomic studies have identified known and novel bordetellae isolated from different environmental sources, providing a new perspective on their natural history. Using phylogenetic analysis, we have shown that human and animal pathogenic bordetellae have most likely evolved from ancestors that originated from soil and water. Our recent study found that <i>B. bronchiseptica</i> can evade amoebic predation and utilize <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> as an expansion and transmission vector, which suggests that the evolutionary pressure to evade the amoebic predator enabled the rise of bordetellae as respiratory pathogens. Interactions with amoeba may represent the starting point for bacterial adaptation to eukaryotic cells. However, as bacteria evolve and adapt to a novel host, they can become specialized and restricted to a specific host. <i>B. pertussis</i> is known to colonize and cause infection only in humans, and this specialization to a closed human-to-human lifecycle has involved genome reduction and the loss of ability to utilize amoeba as an environmental reservoir. The discoveries from studying the interaction of <i>Bordetella</i> species with amoeba will elicit a better understanding of the evolutionary history of these and other important human pathogens.",

        "abstract": "The DDB_G0286605 gene product from Dictyostelium discoideum, an NmrA-like protein that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, has been crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 295\u2005K. A 1.64\u2005\u00c5 resolution data set was collected using synchrotron radiation. The DDB_G0286605 protein crystals belonged to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=67.598, b=54.935, c=84.219\u2005\u00c5, \u03b2 = 109.620\u00b0. Assuming the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the solvent content was estimated to be about 43.25% with 99% probability. Molecular-replacement trials were attempted with three NmrA-like proteins, NmrA, HSCARG and QOR2, as search models, but failed. This may be a consequence of the low sequence identity between the DDB_G0286605 protein and the search models (DDB_G0286605 has a primary-sequence identity of 28, 32 and 19% to NmrA, HCARG and QOR2, respectively).",

        "abstract": "Heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signal transduction plays a pivotal role in both vegetative and developmental stages in the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum. Here we describe novel functions of the G protein alpha subunit G\u03b18 during vegetative and development stages. G\u03b18 is expressed at low levels during vegetative growth. Loss of G\u03b18 promotes cell proliferation, whereas excess G\u03b18 expression dramatically inhibits growth and induces aberrant cytokinesis on substrates in a G\u03b2-dependent manner. Overexpression of G\u03b18 also leads to increased cell-cell cohesion and cell-substrate adhesion. We demonstrate that the increased cell-cell cohesion is mainly caused by induced CadA expression, and the induced cell-substrate adhesion is responsible for the cytokinesis defects. However, the expression of several putative constitutively active mutants of G\u03b18 does not augment the phenotypes caused by intact G\u03b18. G\u03b18 is strongly induced after starvation, and loss of G\u03b18 results in decreased expression of certain adhesion molecules including CsA and tgrC1. Interestingly, G\u03b18 is preferentially distributed in the upper and lower cup of the fruiting body. Lack of G\u03b18 decreases the expression of the specific marker of the anterior-like cells, suggesting that G\u03b18 is required for anterior-like cell differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1) isolated from the cellular slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> can inhibit mammalian calmodulin-dependent cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE1) in vitro. DIF-1 also promotes glucose uptake, at least in part, via a mitochondria- and AMPK-dependent pathway in mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells, but the mechanism underlying this effect has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of DIF-1 on intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels, as well as the effects that DIF-1 and several compounds that increase cAMP and cGMP levels have on glucose uptake in confluent 3T3-L1 cells. DIF-1 at 20 \u03bcM (a concentration that promotes glucose uptake) increased the level of intracellular cAMP by about 20% but did not affect the level of intracellular cGMP. Neither the PDE1 inhibitor 8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 10-200 \u03bcM nor the broad-range PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 40-400 \u03bcM had any marked effects on glucose uptake. The membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP at 200-1000 \u03bcM significantly promoted glucose uptake (by 20-25%), whereas the membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP at 3-100 \u03bcM did not affect glucose uptake. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin at 1-10 \u03bcM promoted glucose uptake by 20-30%.

We describe the cell-cell communication systems that control the developmental programme of D. discoideum, highlighting the central role of cAMP in the regulation of cell movement and cell differentiation. Comparative genomic studies showed that the proteins involved in cAMP signalling are deeply conserved across Dictyostelia and their unicellular amoebozoan ancestors. Comparative functional analysis revealed that cAMP signalling in D. discoideum originated from a second messenger role in amoebozoan encystation. We highlight some molecular changes in cAMP signalling genes that were responsible for the novel roles of cAMP in multicellular development.",

They include macrophages and neutrophils of the mammalian immune system, as well as free-living amoebae that hunt and engulf bacteria for food. Phagocytosis can result in diverse outcomes, ranging from sustenance to infection and colonization by either pathogens or beneficial symbionts-and thus, discrimination may be necessary to seek out good bacteria while avoiding bad ones. Here we tested whether the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum can discriminate among different types of bacteria using behavioural assays where amoebae were presented with paired choices of different bacteria. We observed variation in the extent to which the amoebae pursued different types of bacteria, as well as preferential migration towards Gram-negative compared with Gram-positive bacteria. Response profiles were similar for amoebae that originated from different geographical locations, suggesting that chase preference is conserved across much of the species range. While prior work has demonstrated that bacteria use chemotaxis to seek out amoebae they colonize, our work suggests that the opposite also occurs-amoebae can preferentially direct themselves to particular bacteria in the environment. Preferential sensing and response may help to explain why some amoeba-bacteria associations are more common in nature than others.",

Cells that lack cfaD proliferate faster and reach a higher stationary-phase density than wild-type cells, whereas cells that overexpress CfaD proliferate slowly and reach the stationary phase when at a low density. On a per-nucleus basis, CfaD affects proliferation but not growth. The drawback of not having CfaD is a reduced spore viability. Recombinant CfaD has no detectable protease activity but, when added to cells, inhibits the proliferation of wild-type and cfaD(-) cells. The secreted protein AprA also inhibits proliferation. AprA is necessary for the effect of CfaD on proliferation. Molecular-sieve chromatography indicates that in conditioned growth medium, the 60 kDa CfaD is part of a approximately 150 kDa complex, and both chromatography and pull-down assays suggest that CfaD interacts with AprA. These results suggest that two interacting proteins may function together as a chalone signal in a negative feedback loop that slows Dictyostelium cell proliferation.",

AprA also functions to disperse groups of cells at high density by acting as a chemorepellent. However, the signal transduction pathways associated with AprA and CfaD are not clear, and little is known about how AprA affects the cytoskeleton to regulate cell movement. We found that the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family member PakD is required for both the proliferation-inhibiting activity of AprA and CfaD and the chemorepellent activity of AprA. Similar to cells lacking AprA or CfaD, cells lacking PakD proliferate to a higher cell density than wild-type cells. Recombinant AprA and CfaD inhibit the proliferation of wild-type cells but not cells lacking PakD. Like AprA and CfaD, PakD affects proliferation but does not significantly affect growth (the accumulation of mass) on a per-nucleus basis. In contrast to wild-type cells, cells lacking PakD are not repelled from a source of AprA, and colonies of cells lacking PakD expand at a slower rate than wild-type cells, indicating that PakD is required for AprA-mediated chemorepulsion. A PakD-GFP fusion protein localizes to an intracellular punctum that is not the nucleus or centrosome, and PakD-GFP is also occasionally observed at the rear cortex of moving cells. Vegetative cells lacking PakD show excessive actin-based filopodia-like structures, suggesting that PakD affects actin dynamics, consistent with previously characterized roles of PAK proteins in actin regulation. Together, our results implicate PakD in AprA/CfaD signaling and show that a PAK protein is required for proper chemorepulsive cell movement in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "A variety of bacteria have evolved the ability to interact with environmental phagocytic predators such as amoebae, which may have facilitated their subsequent interactions with phagocytes in animal hosts. Our recent study found that the animal pathogen <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i> can evade predation by the common soil amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, survive within, and hijack its complex life cycle as a propagation and dissemination vector. However, it is uncertain whether the mechanisms allowing interactions with predatory amoebae are conserved among <i>Bordetella</i> species, because divergence, evolution, and adaptation to different hosts and ecological niches was accompanied by acquisition and loss of many genes. Here we tested 9 diverse <i>Bordetella</i> species in three assays representing distinct aspects of their interactions with <i>D. discoideum</i>. Several human and animal pathogens retained the abilities to survive within single-celled amoeba, to inhibit amoebic plaque expansion, and to translocate with amoebae to the fruiting body and disseminate along with the fruiting body. In contrast, these abilities were partly degraded for the bird pathogen <i>B. avium</i>, and for the human-restricted species <i>B. pertussis</i> and <i>B. parapertussis</i>. Interestingly, a different lineage of <i>B. parapertussis</i> only known to infect sheep retained the ability to interact with <i>D. discoideum</i>, demonstrating that these abilities were lost in multiple lineages independently, correlating with niche specialization and recent rapid genome decay apparently mediated by insertion sequences. <i>B. petrii</i> has been isolated sporadically from diverse human and environmental sources, has acquired insertion sequences, undergone genome decay and has also lost the ability to interact with amoebae, suggesting some specialization to some unknown niche. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a set of genes that are potentially associated with the ability to interact with <i>D. discoideum</i>. These results suggest that massive gene loss associated with specialization of some <i>Bordetella</i> species to a closed life cycle in a particular host was repeatedly and independently accompanied by loss of the ability to interact with amoebae in an environmental niche.",

Cooperative systems can be ruined if cheaters that lower group productivity are able to spread. Kin-selection theory predicts that high genetic relatedness can limit cheating, because separation of cheaters and cooperators limits opportunities to cheat and promotes selection against low-fitness groups of cheaters. Here, we confirm this prediction for the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum; relatedness in natural wild groups is so high that socially destructive cheaters should not spread. We illustrate in the laboratory how high relatedness can control a mutant that would destroy cooperation at low relatedness. Finally, we demonstrate that, as predicted, mutant cheaters do not normally harm cooperation in a natural population. Our findings show how altruism is preserved from the disruptive effects of such mutant cheaters and how exceptionally high relatedness among cells is important in promoting the cooperation that underlies multicellular development.",

The role of the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP\u2083) has been particularly controversial. PIP\u2083 has many cellular roles, notably in growth control and macropinocytosis as well as cell motility. Here we show that PIP\u2083 is not only unnecessary for Dictyostelium discoideum to migrate toward folate, but actively inhibits chemotaxis. We find that macropinosomes, but not pseudopods, in growing cells are dependent on PIP\u2083. PIP\u2083 patches in these cells show no directional bias, and overall only PIP\u2083-free pseudopods orient up-gradient. The pseudopod driver suppressor of cAR mutations (SCAR)/WASP and verprolin homologue (WAVE) is not recruited to the center of PIP\u2083 patches, just the edges, where it causes macropinosome formation. Wild-type cells, unlike the widely used axenic mutants, show little macropinocytosis and few large PIP\u2083 patches, but migrate more efficiently toward folate. Tellingly, folate chemotaxis in axenic cells is rescued by knocking out phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases). Thus PIP\u2083 promotes macropinocytosis and interferes with pseudopod orientation during chemotaxis of growing cells.",

        "abstract": "Genome data are increasingly important in the computational identification of novel regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, most ncRNA gene-finders are either specialized to well-characterized ncRNA gene families or require comparisons of closely related genomes. We developed a method for de novo screening for ncRNA genes with a nucleotide composition that stands out against the background genome based on a partial sum process. We compared the performance when assuming independent and first-order Markov-dependent nucleotides, respectively, and used Karlin-Altschul and Karlin-Dembo statistics to evaluate the significance of hits. We hypothesized that a first-order Markov-dependent process might have better power to detect ncRNA genes since nearest-neighbor models have been shown to be successful in predicting RNA structures. A model based on a first-order partial sum process (analyzing overlapping dinucleotides) had better sensitivity and specificity than a zeroth-order model when applied to the AT-rich genome of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. In this genome, we detected 94% of previously known ncRNA genes (at this sensitivity, the false positive rate was estimated to be 25% in a simulated background). The predictions were further refined by clustering candidate genes according to sequence similarity and/or searching for an ncRNA-associated upstream element. We experimentally verified six out of 10 tested ncRNA gene predictions. We conclude that higher-order models, in combination with other information, are useful for identification of novel ncRNA gene families in single-genome analysis of D. discoideum. Our generalizable approach extends the range of genomic data that can be searched for novel ncRNA genes using well-grounded statistical methods.",

The resulting pyramidal wells enable bright-field and fluorescent side-view images, and when combined with z-sectioning, provide additional information for 3D reconstructions of the specimen. We have demonstrated the 3D localization and tracking over time of the centrosome of a live Dictyostelium discoideum. The simultaneous acquisition of images from multiple perspectives also provides a five-fold increase in the theoretical collection efficiency of emitted photons, a property which may be useful for low-light imaging modalities such as bioluminescence, or low abundance surface-marker labelling.",

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> live in the soil as single cells, engulfing bacteria and growing vegetatively. Upon starvation, tens of thousands of amoebae enter a developmental program that includes aggregation, multicellular differentiation, and sporulation. Major shifts across the protein-coding transcriptome accompany these developmental changes. However, no study has presented a global survey of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in <i>D. discoideum</i> To characterize the antisense and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptome, we analyzed previously published developmental time course samples using an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) library preparation method that selectively depletes ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We detected the accumulation of transcripts for 9833 protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 621 lncRNAs, and 162 putative antisense RNAs (asRNAs). The noncoding RNAs were interspersed throughout the genome, and were distinct in expression level, length, and nucleotide composition. The noncoding transcriptome displayed a temporal profile similar to the coding transcriptome, with stages of gradual change interspersed with larger leaps. The transcription profiles of some noncoding RNAs were strongly correlated with known differentially expressed coding RNAs, hinting at a functional role for these molecules during development. Examining the mitochondrial transcriptome, we modeled two novel antisense transcripts. We applied yet another ribosomal depletion method to a subset of the samples to better retain transfer RNA (tRNA) transcripts. We observed polymorphisms in tRNA anticodons that suggested a post-transcriptional means by which <i>D. discoideum</i> compensates for codons missing in the genomic complement of tRNAs. We concluded that the prevalence and characteristics of long ncRNAs indicate that these molecules are relevant to the progression of molecular and cellular phenotypes during development.",

        "abstract": "Cytokinesis is the final step of mitosis when a mother cell is separated into two daughter cells. Major cytoskeletal changes are essential for cytokinesis; it is, however, not well understood how the microtubules and actomyosin cytoskeleton are exactly regulated in time and space. In this paper, we show that during the early stages of cytokinesis, in rounded-up Dictyostelium discoideum cells, the small G-protein Rap1 is activated uniformly at the cell cortex. When cells begin to elongate, active Rap1 becomes restricted from the furrow region, where the myosin contractile ring is subsequently formed. In the final stages of cytokinesis, active Rap1 is only present at the cell poles. Mutant cells with decreased Rap1 activation at the poles showed strongly decreased growth rates. Hyperactivation of Rap1 results in severe growth delays and defective spindle formation in adherent cells and cell death in suspension. Furthermore, Rap mutants show aberrant regulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, resulting in extended furrow ingression times and asymmetrical cell division. We propose that Rap1 drives cytokinesis progression by coordinating the three major cytoskeletal components: microtubules, actin, and myosin II. Importantly, mutated forms of Rap also affect cytokinesis in other organisms, suggesting a conserved role for Rap in cell division.",

Doses that have little effect on development have previously been shown to increase the level of the rnrB transcript by up to 15-fold. Here we show that all elements necessary for DNA-damage induction are contained in a 450 bp promoter fragment. We used a fusion of the rnrB promoter with the gene encoding GFP to demonstrate an up to 10-fold induction at the RNA level, which appears in all aspects similar to induction of the endogenous rnrB transcript. Using a fusion with the lacZ gene we observed an up to 7-fold induction at the protein level. These results indicate that the rnrB promoter can be used to regulate the expression of specific genes in D.discoideum. This controllable gene expression system provides the following new characteristics: the induction is rapid, taking place in the order of minutes, and the promoter is responsive at all stages of the D.discoideum life cycle.",

To investigate the role of PKA in the basic motile behavior and chemotaxis of Dictyostelium discoideum, pkaR mutant cells were subjected to computer-assisted two- and three-dimensional motion analysis. pkaR mutant cells crawled at only half the speed of wild-type cells in buffer, chemotaxed in spatial gradients of cyclic AMP (cAMP) but with reduced efficiency, were incapable of suppressing lateral pseudopods in the front of temporal waves of cAMP, a requirement for natural chemotaxis, did not exhibit the normal velocity surge in response to the front of a wave, and were incapable of chemotaxing toward an aggregation center in natural waves generated by wild-type cells that made up the majority of cells in mixed cultures. Many of the behavioral defects appeared to be the result of the constitutively ovoid shape of the pkaR mutant cells, which forced the dominant pseudopod off the substratum and to the top of the cell body. The behavioral abnormalities that pkaR mutant cells shared with regA mutant cells are discussed by considering the pathway ERK2 perpendicular RegA perpendicular [cAMP] --> PKA, which emanates from the front of a wave. The results demonstrate that cells must suppress PKA activity in order to elongate along a substratum, suppress lateral-pseudopod formation, and crawl and chemotax efficiently. The results also implicate PKA activation in dismantling cell polarity at the peak and in the back of a natural cAMP wave.",

Its motor domain (head) hydrolyzes ATP and induces conformational changes of linker, stalk, and microtubule binding domain (MTBD) to trigger stepping motion. Here we applied scattering imaging of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) to visualize load-free stepping motion of processive dynein. We observed artificially-dimerized chimeric dynein, which has the head, linker, and stalk from Dictyostelium discoideum cytoplasmic dynein and the MTBD from human axonemal dynein, whose structure has been well-studied by cryo-electron microscopy. One head of a dimer was labeled with 30\u2009nm AuNP, and stepping motions were observed with 100 \u03bcs time resolution and sub-nanometer localization precision at physiologically-relevant 1\u2009mM ATP. We found 8\u2009nm forward and backward steps and 5\u2009nm side steps, consistent with on- and off-axes pitches of binding cleft between \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers on the microtubule. Probability of the forward step was 1.8 times higher than that of the backward step, and similar to those of the side steps. One-head bound states were not clearly observed, and the steps were limited by a single rate constant. Our results indicate dynein mainly moves with biased small stepping motion in which only backward steps are slightly suppressed.",

        "abstract": "Experiments in amoebae and neutrophils have shown that local accumulations of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P(3)] mediate the ability of cells to migrate during gradient sensing. To define the nature of this response, we subjected Dictyostelium discoideum cells to measurable temporal and spatial chemotactic inputs and analyzed the accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P(3) on the membrane, as well as the recruitment of the enzymes phosphoinositide 3-kinase and PTEN. In latrunculin-treated cells, spatial gradients elicited a PI(3,4,5)P(3) response only on the front portion of the cell where the response increased more steeply than the gradient and did not depend on its absolute concentration. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase bound to the membrane only at the front, although it was less sharply localized than PI(3,4,5)P(3). Membrane-bound PTEN was highest at the rear and varied inversely with receptor occupancy. The localization of PI(3,4,5)P(3) was enhanced further in untreated polarized cells containing an intact cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the treated cells could respond to two independent gradients simultaneously, demonstrating that a response at the front does not necessarily inhibit the back. Combinations of temporal and spatial stimuli provided evidence of an inhibitory process and showed that a gradient generates a persistent steady-state response independent of a previous history of exposure to chemoattractant. These results support a local excitation/global inhibition model and argue against other schemes proposed to explain directional sensing.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), also known as Batten disease, is a debilitating neurological disorder that affects both children and adults. Thirteen genetically distinct genes have been identified that when mutated, result in abnormal lysosomal function and an excessive accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in neurons, as well as other cell types outside of the central nervous system. The NCL family of proteins is comprised of lysosomal enzymes (PPT1/CLN1, TPP1/CLN2, CTSD/CLN10, CTSF/CLN13), proteins that peripherally associate with membranes (DNAJC5/CLN4, KCTD7/CLN14), a soluble lysosomal protein (CLN5), a protein present in the secretory pathway (PGRN/CLN11), and several proteins that display different subcellular localizations (CLN3, CLN6, MFSD8/CLN7, CLN8, ATP13A2/CLN12). Unfortunately, the precise functions of many of the NCL proteins are still unclear, which has made targeted therapy development challenging. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has emerged as an excellent model system for studying the normal functions of proteins linked to human neurological disorders. Intriguingly, the genome of this eukaryotic soil microbe encodes homologs of 11 of the 13 known genes linked to NCL. The genetic tractability of the organism, combined with its unique life cycle, makes Dictyostelium an attractive model system for studying the functions of NCL proteins. Moreover, the ability of human NCL proteins to rescue gene-deficiency phenotypes in Dictyostelium suggests that the biological pathways regulating NCL protein function are likely conserved from Dictyostelium to human. In this review, I will discuss each of the NCL homologs in Dictyostelium in turn and describe how future studies can exploit the advantages of the system by testing new hypotheses that may ultimately lead to effective therapy options for this devastating and currently untreatable neurological disorder.",

We reasoned that other regulators of migration could be obtained through a screen for overly adhesive mutants. A screen of restriction enzyme-mediated integration mutagenized cells yielded numerous mutants with the desired phenotypes, and the insertion sites in 18 of the strains were mapped. These regulators of adhesion and motility mutants have increased adhesion and decreased motility. Characterization of seven strains demonstrated decreased directed migration, flatness, increased filamentous actin-based protrusions, and increased signal transduction network activity. Many of the genes share homology to human genes and demonstrate the diverse array of cellular networks that function in adhesion and migration.",

Here we present a methodology to measure the extent of dimerization of GFP-tagged proteins in living cells, using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis of single-color fluorescence fluctuation data. We named this analysis method brightness and diffusion global analysis (BDGA) and adapted it for biological purposes. Using cell lysates containing different ratios of GFP and tandem-dimer GFP (diGFP), we show that the average brightness per particle is proportional to the fraction of dimer present. We further adapted this methodology for its application in living cells, and we were able to distinguish GFP, diGFP, as well as ligand-induced dimerization of FKBP12 (FK506 binding protein 12)-GFP. While other analysis methods have only sporadically been used to study dimerization in living cells and may be prone to errors, this paper provides a robust approach for the investigation of any cytosolic protein using single-color fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy.",

Cells are guided by actin-filled protrusions in the front, whereas myosin filaments retract the rear of the cell. Previous work demonstrated that chemotaxis of unpolarized amoeboid Dictyostelium discoideum cells is mediated by two parallel pathways, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Here, we show that polarized cells exhibit very good chemotaxis with inhibited PI3K and PLA2 activity. Using genetic screens, we demonstrate that this activity is mediated by a soluble guanylyl cyclase, providing two signals. The protein localizes to the leading edge where it interacts with actin filaments, whereas the cyclic guanosine monophosphate product induces myosin filaments in the rear of the cell. We conclude that chemotaxis is mediated by multiple signaling pathways regulating protrusions at the front and rear of the cell. Cells that express only rear activity are polarized but do not exhibit chemotaxis, whereas cells with only front signaling are unpolarized but undergo chemotaxis.",

        "abstract": "Small RNAs play crucial roles in regulation of gene expression in many eukaryotes. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of 18-26 nt RNAs in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. This survey uncovered developmentally regulated microRNA candidates whose biogenesis, at least in one case, is dependent on a Dicer homolog, DrnB. Furthermore, we identified a large number of 21 nt RNAs originating from the DIRS-1 retrotransposon, clusters of which have been suggested to constitute centromeres. Small RNAs from another retrotransposon, Skipper, were significantly up-regulated in strains depleted of the second Dicer-like protein, DrnA, and a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RrpC. In contrast, the expression of DIRS-1 small RNAs was not altered in any of the analyzed strains. This suggests the presence of multiple RNAi pathways in D. discoideum. In addition, we isolated several small RNAs with antisense complementarity to mRNAs. Three of these mRNAs are developmentally regulated. Interestingly, all three corresponding genes express longer antisense RNAs from which the small RNAs may originate. In at least one case, the longer antisense RNA is complementary to the spliced but not the unspliced pre-mRNA, indicating synthesis by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

Small extracellular electric fields can guide the migration of amoeboid cells, and we established a large-scale screening approach to search for mutants with electrotaxis phenotypes from a collection of 563 Dictyostelium discoideum strains with morphological defects. We identified 28 strains that were defective in electrotaxis and 10 strains with a slightly higher directional response. Using plasmid rescue followed by gene disruption, we identified some of the mutated genes, including some previously implicated in chemotaxis. Among these, we studied PiaA, which encodes a critical component of TORC2, a kinase protein complex that transduces changes in motility by activating the kinase PKB (also known as Akt). Furthermore, we found that electrotaxis was decreased in mutants lacking gefA, rasC, rip3, lst8, or pkbR1, genes that encode other components of the TORC2-PKB pathway. Thus, we have developed a high-throughput screening technique that will be a useful tool to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of electrotaxis.",

Here we show pharmacologically and genetically that ABC transporters mediate cAMP export.

        "abstract": "Alternative synonymous codons are often used at unequal frequencies. Classically, studies of such codon usage bias (CUB) attempted to separate the impact of neutral from selective forces by assuming that deviations from a predicted neutral equilibrium capture selection. However, GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) can also cause deviation from a neutral null. Alternatively, selection has been inferred from CUB in highly expressed genes, but the accuracy of this approach has not been extensively tested, and gBGC can interfere with such extrapolations (e.g., if expression and gene conversion rates covary). It is therefore critical to examine deviations from a mutational null in a species with no gBGC. To achieve this goal, we implement such an analysis in the highly AT rich genome of Dictyostelium discoideum, where we find no evidence of gBGC. We infer neutral CUB under mutational equilibrium to quantify \"adaptive codon preference,\" a nontautologous genome wide quantitative measure of the relative selection strength driving CUB. We observe signatures of purifying selection consistent with selection favoring adaptive codon preference. Preferred codons are not GC rich, underscoring the independence from gBGC. Expression-associated \"preference\" largely matches adaptive codon preference but does not wholly capture the influence of selection shaping patterns across all genes, suggesting selective constraints associated specifically with high expression. We observe patterns consistent with effects on mRNA translation and stability shaping adaptive codon preference. Thus, our approach to quantifying adaptive codon preference provides a framework for inferring the sources of selection that shape CUB across different contexts within the genome.",

        "abstract": "Cell migration is driven by the establishment of disparity between the cortical properties of the softer front and the more rigid rear allowing front extension and actomyosin-based rear contraction. However, how the cortical actin meshwork in the rear is generated remains elusive. Here we identify the mDia1-like formin A (ForA) from Dictyostelium discoideum that generates a subset of filaments as the basis of a resilient cortical actin sheath in the rear. Mechanical resistance of this actin compartment is accomplished by actin crosslinkers and IQGAP-related proteins, and is mandatory to withstand the increased contractile forces in response to mechanical stress by impeding unproductive blebbing in the rear, allowing efficient cell migration in two-dimensional-confined environments. Consistently, ForA supresses the formation of lateral protrusions, rapidly relocalizes to new prospective ends in repolarizing cells and is required for cortical integrity. Finally, we show that ForA utilizes the phosphoinositide gradients in polarized cells for subcellular targeting.",

        "abstract": "Group 4 Dictyostelia, like Dictyostelium discoideum, self-organize into aggregates and fruiting bodies using propagating waves of the chemoattractant cAMP, which are produced by a network containing the adenylate cyclase AcaA, cAMP receptors (Cars) and the extracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase PdsA. Additionally, AcaA and the adenylate cyclases AcrA and AcgA produce secreted cAMP for induction of aggregative and prespore gene expression and intracellular cAMP for PKA activation, with PKA triggering initiation of development and spore and stalk maturation. Non-group 4 species also use secreted cAMP to coordinate post-aggregative morphogenesis and prespore induction but use other attractants to aggregate. To understand how cAMP's role in aggregation evolved, we deleted the acaA, carA and pdsA genes of Polysphondylium violaceum, a sister species to group 4. acaA- fruiting bodies had thinner stalks but otherwise developed normally. Deletion of acrA, which was similarly expressed as acaA, reduced aggregation centre initiation and, as also occurred after D. discoideum acrA deletion, caused spore instability. Double acaA-acrA- mutants failed to form stable aggregates, a defect that was overcome by exposure to the PKA agonist 8Br-cAMP, and therefore likely due to reduced intracellular cAMP. The carA- and pdsA- mutants showed normal aggregation and fruiting body development. Together, the data showed that P. violaceum development does not critically require secreted cAMP, while roles of intracellular cAMP in initiation of development and spore maturation are conserved. Apparently, cell-cell communication underwent major taxon-group specific innovation in Dictyostelia.",

Extensive studies have been devoted to achieving a better understanding of the mechanism(s) used by a neutrophil to choose its direction of polarity and to crawl effectively in response to chemoattractant gradients.

Genome wide analysis of the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum revealed a surprisingly large number of Ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (RasGEFs). RasGEFs promote the activation of Ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus conferring to RasGEFs the role of main activator of Ras proteins. Up to date only four RasGEFs, which are all non-redundant either for growth or development, have been characterized in Dictyostelium.

Gene silencing was accompanied by the appearance of sequence-specific RNA about 23mers and seemed to have a limited capacity. The three Dictyostelium homologues of the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RrpA, RrpB, and DosA) all contain an N-terminal helicase domain homologous to the one in the dicer nuclease, suggesting exon shuffling between RNA-directed RNA polymerase and the dicer homologue. Only the knock-out of rrpA resulted in a loss of the hairpin RNA effect and simultaneously in a loss of detectable about 23mers. However, about 23mers were still generated by the Dictyostelium dsRNase in vitro with extracts from rrpA(-), rrpB(-), and DosA(-) cells. Both RrpA and a target gene were required for production of detectable amounts of about 23mers, suggesting that target sequences are involved in about 23mer amplification.",

Here, we identify a Rap1 guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP; RapGAP1) that helps mediate cell adhesion by negatively regulating Rap1 at the leading edge. Defects in spatial regulation of the cell attachment at the leading edge in rapGAP1- (null) cells or cells overexpressing RapGAP1 (RapGAP1(OE)) lead to defective chemotaxis. rapGAP1- cells have extended chemoattractant-mediated Rap1 activation kinetics and decreased MyoII assembly, whereas RapGAP1(OE) cells show reciprocal phenotypes. We see that RapGAP1 translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation and localizes to the leading edge of chemotaxing cells via an F-actin-dependent pathway. RapGAP1 localization is negatively regulated by Ctx, an F-actin bundling protein that functions during cytokinesis. Loss of Ctx leads to constitutive and uniform RapGAP1 cortical localization. We suggest that RapGAP1 functions in the spatial and temporal regulation of attachment sites through MyoII assembly via regulation of Rap1-guanosine triphosphate.",

The MyoB-specific, single-lobe EF-hand light chain MlcB binds the sole IQ motif of MyoB with submicromolar affinity in the absence and presence of Ca(2+). However, the structural features of this novel myosin light chain and its interaction with its cognate IQ motif remain uncharacterized. Here, we describe the NMR-derived solution structure of apoMlcB, which displays a globular four-helix bundle. Helix 1 adopts a unique orientation when compared with the apo states of the EF-hand calcium-binding proteins calmodulin, S100B, and calbindin D9k. NMR-based chemical shift perturbation mapping identified a hydrophobic MyoB IQ binding surface that involves amino acid residues in helices I and IV and the functional N-terminal Ca(2+) binding loop, a site that appears to be maintained when MlcB adopts the holo state. Complementary mutagenesis and binding studies indicated that residues Ile-701, Phe-705, and Trp-708 of the MyoB IQ motif are critical for recognition of MlcB, which together allowed the generation of a structural model of the apoMlcB-MyoB IQ complex. We conclude that the mode of IQ motif recognition by the novel single-lobe MlcB differs considerably from that of stereotypical bilobal light chains such as calmodulin.",

        "abstract": "<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an environmental yeast that can cause opportunistic infections in humans. As infecting animals does not form part of its normal life-cycle, it has been proposed that the virulence traits that allow cryptococci to resist immune cells were selected through interactions with environmental phagocytes such as amoebae. Here, we investigate the interactions between <i>C. neoformans</i> and the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. We show that like macrophages, <i>D. discoideum</i> is unable to kill <i>C. neoformans</i> upon phagocytosis. Despite this, we find that the yeast pass through the amoebae with an apparently normal phagocytic transit and are released alive by constitutive exocytosis after ~80 min. This is the canonical pathway in amoebae, used to dispose of indigestible material after nutrient extraction. Surprisingly however, we show that upon either genetic or pharmacological blockage of constitutive exocytosis, <i>C. neoformans</i> still escape from <i>D. discoideum</i> by a secondary mechanism. We demonstrate that constitutive exocytosis-independent egress is stochastic and actin-independent. This strongly resembles the non-lytic release of cryptococci by vomocytosis from macrophages, which do not perform constitutive exocytosis and normally retain phagocytosed material. Our data indicate that vomocytosis is functionally redundant for escape from amoebae, which thus may not be the primary driver for its evolutionary selection. Nonetheless, we show that vomocytosis of <i>C. neoformans</i> is mechanistically conserved in hosts ranging from amoebae to man, providing new avenues to understand this poorly-understood but important virulence mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Homeodomain proteins control the developmental transition between the haploid and diploid phases in several eukaryotic lineages, but it is not known whether this regulatory mechanism reflects the ancestral condition or, instead, convergent evolution. We have characterized the mating-type locus of the amoebozoan <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, which encodes two pairs of small proteins that determine the three mating types of this species; none of these proteins display recognizable homology to known families. We report that the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of two of them, MatA and MatB, contain helix-turn-helix folds flanked by largely disordered amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails. This fold closely resembles that of homeodomain transcription factors, and, like those proteins, MatA and MatB each bind DNA characteristically using the third helix of their folded domains. By constructing chimeric versions containing parts of MatA and MatB, we demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal tail, not the central DNA binding motif, confers mating specificity, providing mechanistic insight into how a third mating type might have originated. Finally, we show that these homeodomain-like proteins specify zygote function: Hemizygous diploids, formed in crosses between a wild-type strain and a <i>mat</i> null mutant, grow and differentiate identically to haploids. We propose that <i>Dictyostelium</i> MatA and MatB are divergent homeodomain proteins with a conserved function in triggering the haploid-to-diploid transition that can be traced back to the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "Triacylglycerol (TAG), the common energy storage molecule, is formed from diacylglycerol and a coenzyme A-activated fatty acid by the action of an acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). In order to conduct this step, most organisms rely on more than one enzyme. The two main candidates in Dictyostelium discoideum are Dgat1 and Dgat2. We show, by creating single and double knockout mutants, that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Dgat1 enzyme provides the predominant activity, whereas the lipid droplet constituent Dgat2 contributes less activity. This situation may be opposite from what is seen in mammalian cells. Dictyostelium Dgat2 is specialized for the synthesis of TAG, as is the mammalian enzyme. In contrast, mammalian DGAT1 is more promiscuous regarding its substrates, producing diacylglycerol, retinyl esters, and waxes in addition to TAG. The Dictyostelium Dgat1, however, produces TAG, wax esters, and, most interestingly, also neutral ether lipids, which represent a significant constituent of lipid droplets. Ether lipids had also been found in mammalian lipid droplets, but the role of DGAT1 in their synthesis was unknown. The ability to form TAG through either Dgat1 or Dgat2 activity is essential for Dictyostelium to grow on bacteria, its natural food substrate.",

In pioneering work in the late 1990s, it was hypothesized that a drift of cellular parameters (along a 'developmental path'), together with differences in cell properties ('desynchronization' of cells on the developmental path) can establish self-organized spatio-temporal patterns (in their example, spiral waves of cAMP in a colony of Dictyostelium discoideum cells) starting from a homogeneous state. Here, we embed a generic model of an excitable medium, a lattice of diffusively coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, into a developmental-path framework. In this minimal model of spiral wave generation, we can now study the predictability of spatio-temporal patterns from cell properties as a function of desynchronization (or 'spread') of cells along the developmental path and the drift speed of cell properties on the path. As a function of drift speed and desynchronization, we observe systematically different routes towards fully established patterns, as well as strikingly different correlations between cell properties and pattern features. We show that the predictability of spatio-temporal patterns from cell properties contains important information on the pattern formation process as well as on the underlying dynamical system.",

During autophagy, the core autophagy protein ATG12 plays, together with ATG5 and ATG16, an essential role in the expansion of the autophagosomal membrane. In this study we analyzed gene replacement mutants of <i>atg12</i> in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> AX2 wild-type and ATG16\u203e cells. RNA<sub>seq</sub> analysis revealed a strong enrichment of, firstly, autophagy genes among the up-regulated genes and, secondly, genes implicated in cell motility and phagocytosis among the down-regulated genes in the generated ATG12\u203e, ATG16\u203e and ATG12\u203e/16\u203e cells. The mutant strains showed similar defects in fruiting body formation, autolysosome maturation, and cellular viability, implying that ATG12 and ATG16 act as a functional unit in canonical autophagy. In contrast, ablation of ATG16 or of ATG12 and ATG16 resulted in slightly more severe defects in axenic growth, macropinocytosis, and protein homeostasis than ablation of only ATG12, suggesting that ATG16 fulfils an additional function in these processes. Phagocytosis of yeast, spore viability, and maximal cell density were much more affected in ATG12\u203e/16\u203e cells, indicating that both proteins also have cellular functions independent of each other.

Cells lacking Htt showed slower migration toward the chemoattractant cAMP and contained lower levels of cortical myosin II, which is likely due to defects in dephosphorylation of myosin II mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). htt(-) cells also failed to maintain myosin II in the cortex of the cleavage furrow, generating unseparated daughter cells connected through a thin cytoplasmic bridge. Furthermore, similar to Dictyostelium htt(-) cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of human HTT also decreased the PP2A activity in HeLa cells.

Three enzymes belong to the ubiquitous class I PDEs, common in all eukaryotes, whereas four enzymes belong to the rare class II PDEs that are present in bacteria and lower eukaryotes. Since all D. discoideum PDEs are now characterized we have calculated the contribution of each enzyme in the degradation of the three important pools of cyclic nucleotides: (i) extracellular cAMP that induces chemotaxis during aggregation and differentiation in slugs; (ii) intracellular cAMP that mediates development; and (iii) intracellular cGMP that mediates chemotaxis. It appears that each cyclic nucleotide pool is degraded by a combination of enzymes that have different affinities, allowing a broad range of substrate concentrations to be degraded with first-order kinetics. Extracellular cAMP is degraded predominantly by the class II high-affinity enzyme DdPDE1 and its close homologue DdPDE7, and in the multicellular stage also by the low-affinity transmembrane class I enzyme DdPDE4. Intracellular cAMP is degraded by the DdPDE2, a class I enzyme regulated by histidine kinase/phospho-relay, and by the cAMP-/cGMP-stimulated class II DdPDE6. Finally, basal intracellular cGMP is degraded predominantly by the high-affinity class I DdPDE3, while the elevated cGMP levels that arise after receptor stimulation are degraded predominantly by a cGMP-stimulated cGMP-specific class II DdPDE5. The analysis shows that the combination of enzymes is tuned to keep the concentration and lifetime of the substrate within a functional range.",

Five P2X-like proteins (dP2XA-E) are present in this organism. However, their roles in purinergic signaling are unclear, because dP2XA proved to have an intracellular localization on the contractile vacuole where it is thought to be required for osmoregulation. To determine functional properties of the remaining four dP2X-like proteins and to assess their cellular roles, we recorded membrane currents from expressed cloned receptors and generated a quintuple knock-out Dictyostelium strain devoid of dP2X receptors. ATP evoked inward currents at dP2XB and dP2XE receptors but not at dP2XC or dP2XD. beta,gamma-Imido-ATP was more potent than ATP at dP2XB but a weak partial agonist at dP2XE. Currents in dP2XB and dP2XE were strongly inhibited by Na(+) but insensitive to copper and the P2 receptor antagonists pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid and suramin. Unusual for P2X channels, dP2XA and dP2XB were also Cl(-)-permeable. The extracellular purinergic response to ATP persisted in p2xA/B/C/D/E quintuple knock-out Dictyostelium demonstrating that dP2X channels are not responsible. dP2XB, -C, -D, and -E were found to be intracellularly localized to the contractile vacuole with the ligand binding domain facing the lumen. However, quintuple p2xA/B/C/D/E null cells were still capable of regulating cell volume in water demonstrating that, contrary to previous findings, dP2X receptors are not required for osmoregulation. Responses to the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium, however, were reduced in p2xA/B/C/D/E null cells suggesting that dP2X receptors play a role in intracellular calcium signaling.",

Here, we use a proteomics approach to identify direct interactors of two key nodes of the contractility controller in the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>: the actin crosslinker cortexillin I and the scaffolding protein IQGAP2. We highlight several unexpected proteins that suggest feedback from metabolic and RNA-binding proteins on the contractility controller. Quantitative <i>in vivo</i> biochemical measurements reveal direct interactions between myosin II and cortexillin I, which form the core mechanosensor. Furthermore, IQGAP1 negatively regulates mechanoresponsiveness by competing with IQGAP2 for binding the myosin II-cortexillin I complex. These myosin II-cortexillin I-IQGAP2 complexes are pre-assembled into higher-order mechanoresponsive contractility kits (MCKs) that are poised to integrate into the cortex upon diffusional encounter coincident with mechanical inputs.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

        "abstract": "Many biological systems respond to environmental changes by activating intracellular signaling cascades, resulting in an appropriate response. One such system is represented by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. When food sources become scarce, these unicellular cells can initiate a cAMP-driven multicellular aggregation program to ensure long-term survival. On starvation, the cells secrete conditioned medium factors that initiate cAMP signal transduction by inducing expression of genes such as cAMP receptors and adenylate cyclase. The mechanisms involved in the activation of the first pulses of cAMP release have been unclear. We here show a crucial role for the evolutionarily conserved protein coronin A in the initiation of the cAMP response. On starvation, coronin A-deficient cells failed to up-regulate the expression of cAMP-regulated genes, thereby failing to initiate development, despite a normal prestarvation response. Of importance, external addition of cAMP to coronin A-deficient cells resulted in normal chemotaxis and aggregate formation, thereby restoring the developmental program and suggesting a functional cAMP relay in the absence of coronin A. These results suggest that coronin A is dispensable for cAMP sensing, chemotaxis, and development per se but is part of a signal transduction cascade essential for system initiation leading to multicellular development in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "Cytokinesis in eukaryotic organisms is under the control of small GTP-binding proteins, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Cortexillins are actin-binding proteins whose activity is crucial for cytokinesis in Dictyostelium. Here we show that the IQGAP-related and Rac1-binding protein DGAP1 specifically interacts with the C-terminal, actin-bundling domain of cortexillin I. Like cortexillin I, DGAP1 is enriched in the cortex of interphase cells and translocates to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. The activated form of the small GTPase Rac1A recruits DGAP1 into a quaternary complex with cortexillin I and II. In DGAP1(-) mutants, a complex can still be formed with a second IQGAP-related protein, GAPA. The simultaneous elimination of DGAP1 and GAPA, however, prevents complex formation and localization of the cortexillins to the cleavage furrow. This leads to a severe defect in cytokinesis, which is similar to that found in cortexillin I/II double-null mutants. Our observations define a novel and functionally significant signaling pathway that is required for cytokinesis.",

        "abstract": "Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) deficiency in enteric bacterial pathogens reduces their ability to invade and establish systemic infections in different hosts. For instance, inactivation of the polyP kinase gene (<i>ppk</i>) encoding the enzyme responsible for polyP biosynthesis reduces invasiveness and intracellular survival of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>. Typhimurium) in epithelial cells and macrophages <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, the virulence <i>in vivo</i> of a <i>S</i>. Typhimurium \u0394<i>ppk</i> mutant is significantly reduced in a murine infection model. In spite of these observations, the role played by polyP during the <i>Salmonella</i>-host interaction is not well understood. The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> has proven to be a useful model for studying relevant aspects of the host-pathogen interaction. In fact, many intracellular pathogens can survive within <i>D. discoideum</i> cells using molecular mechanisms also required to survive within macrophages. Recently, we established that <i>S</i>. Typhimurium is able to survive intracellularly in <i>D. discoideum</i> and identified relevant genes linked to virulence that are crucial for this process. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a polyP deficiency in <i>S</i>. Typhimurium during its interaction with <i>D. discoideum</i>. To do this, we evaluated the intracellular survival of wild-type and \u0394<i>ppk</i> strains of <i>S</i>. Typhimurium in <i>D. discoideum</i> and the ability of these strains to delay the social development of the amoeba. In contrast to the wild-type strain, the \u0394<i>ppk</i> mutant was unable to survive intracellularly in <i>D. discoideum</i> and enabled the social development of the amoeba. Both phenotypes were complemented using a plasmid carrying a copy of the <i>ppk</i> gene. Next, we simultaneously evaluated the proteomic response of both <i>S</i>. Typhimurium and <i>D. discoideum</i> during host-pathogen interaction via global proteomic profiling. The analysis of our results allowed the identification of novel molecular signatures that give insight into <i>Salmonella</i>-<i>Dictyostelium</i> interaction. Altogether, our results indicate that inorganic polyP is essential for <i>S</i>. Typhimurium virulence and survival in <i>D. discoideum</i>. In addition, we have validated the use of global proteomic analyses to simultaneously evaluate the host-pathogen interaction of <i>S</i>. Typhimurium and <i>D. discoideum</i>. Furthermore, our infection assays using these organisms can be exploited to screen for novel anti-virulence molecules targeting inorganic polyP biosynthesis.",

Our results show that the Gly-680 mutations lead to uncoupling of the reactive thiol region from the surrounding structural elements.

        "abstract": "Dynamin is a large GTPase responsible for diverse cellular processes, such as endocytosis, division of organelles, and cytokinesis. The social amoebozoan, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, has five dynamin-like proteins: dymA, dymB, dlpA, dlpB, and dlpC. DymA, dlpA, or dlpB-deficient cells exhibited defects in cytokinesis. DlpA and dlpB were found to colocalize at cleavage furrows from the early phase, and dymA localized at the intercellular bridge connecting the two daughter cells, indicating that these dynamins contribute to cytokinesis at distinct dividing stages. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed that dlpA and dlpB colocalized at individual dots at the furrow cortex. However, dlpA and dlpB did not colocalize with clathrin, suggesting that they are not involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The fact that dlpA did not localize at the furrow in dlpB null cells and vice versa, as well as other several lines of evidence, suggests that hetero-oligomerization of dlpA and dlpB is required for them to bind to the furrow. The hetero-oligomers directly or indirectly associate with actin filaments, stabilizing them in the contractile rings. Interestingly, dlpA, but not dlpB, accumulated at the phagocytic cups independently of dlpB. Our results suggest that the hetero-oligomers of dlpA and dlpB contribute to cytokinesis cooperatively with dymA.",

        "abstract": "The directional movement of cells in chemoattractant gradients requires sophisticated control of the actin cytoskeleton. Uniform exposure of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae as well as mammalian leukocytes to chemoattractant triggers two phases of actin polymerization. In the initial rapid phase, motility stops and the cell rounds up. During the second slow phase, pseudopodia are extended from local regions of the cell perimeter. These responses are highly correlated with temporal and spatial accumulations of PI(3,4,5)P3/PI(3,4)P2 reflected by the translocation of specific PH domains to the membrane. The slower phase of PI accumulation and actin polymerization is more prominent in less differentiated, unpolarized cells, is selectively increased by disruption of PTEN, and is relatively more sensitive to perturbations of PI3K. Optimal levels of the second responses allow the cell to respond rapidly to switches in gradient direction by extending lateral pseudopods. Consequently, PI3K inhibitors impair chemotaxis in wild-type cells but partially restore polarity and chemotactic response in pten- cells. Surprisingly, the fast phase of PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulation and actin polymerization, which is relatively resistant to PI3K inhibition, can support inefficient but reasonably accurate chemotaxis.",

Cell motility is a fundamental and ancient cellular behaviour that contributes to metastasis and is conserved in simple organisms. In this Review, we evaluate insights relevant to human cancer that are derived from the study of cell motility in non-mammalian model organisms. Dictyostelium discoideum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio permit direct observation of cells moving in complex native environments and lend themselves to large-scale genetic and pharmacological screening. We highlight insights derived from each of these organisms, including the detailed signalling network that governs chemotaxis towards chemokines; a novel mechanism of basement membrane invasion; the positive role of E-cadherin in collective direction-sensing; the identification and optimization of kinase inhibitors for metastatic thyroid cancer on the basis of work in flies; and the value of zebrafish for live imaging, especially of vascular remodelling and interactions between tumour cells and host tissues. While the motility of tumour cells and certain host cells promotes metastatic spread, the motility of tumour-reactive T cells likely increases their antitumour effects. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying all types of cell motility, with the ultimate goal of identifying combination therapies that will increase the motility of beneficial cells and block the spread of harmful cells.",

To comprehend the genetic potential and networks that direct growth and multicellular development, we are performing a large-scale analysis of Dictyostelium cDNAs. Here, we newly determine 7720 nucleotide sequences of cDNAs from the multicellular, slug stage (S) and 10 439 from the unicellular, vegetative stage (V). The combined 26 954 redundant ESTs were computer assembled using the PHRAP program to yield 5381 independent sequences. These 5381 predicted genes represent about half of the estimated coding potential of the organism. One-third of them were classified into 12 functional categories. Although the overall classification patterns of the V and S libraries were very similar, stage-specific genes exist in every category. The majority of V-specific genes function in some aspect of protein translation, while such genes are in a minority in the S-specific and common populations. Instead, genes for signal transduction and multicellular organization are enriched in the population of S-specific genes. Genes encoding the enzymes of basic metabolism are mainly found in the common gene population. These results therefore suggest major differences between growing and developing Dictyostelium cells in the nature of the genes transcribed.",

Contact between neighboring cells and diffusive attractant molecules are two of the major determinants of tissue-level patterning; however, in most cases, molecular and developmental complexity hinders one from decoding the exact governing rules of individual cell movement. A primordial example of tissue patterning by cell rearrangement is found in the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> where the organizing center or the \"tip\" self-organizes as a result of sorting of differentiating prestalk and prespore cells. By employing microfluidics and microsphere-based manipulation of navigational cues at the single-cell level, here we uncovered a previously overlooked mode of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cell migration that is strictly directed by cell-cell contact. The cell-cell contact signal is mediated by E-set Ig-like domain-containing heterophilic adhesion molecules TgrB1/TgrC1 that act in trans to induce plasma membrane recruitment of the SCAR complex and formation of dendritic actin networks, and the resulting cell protrusion competes with those induced by chemoattractant cAMP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both prestalk and prespore cells can protrude toward the contact signal as well as to chemotax toward cAMP; however, when given both signals, prestalk cells orient toward the chemoattractant, whereas prespore cells choose the contact signal. These data suggest a model of cell sorting by competing juxtacrine and diffusive cues, each with potential to drive its own mode of collective cell migration.",

This analysis revealed that the majority of host proteins are shared in <i>D. discoideum</i> or macrophage LCVs containing the mutant or the parental strain, respectively, whereas some proteins preferentially localize to distinct LCVs.

The localization pattern of active Rap1 on <i>D. discoideum</i> or macrophage LCVs was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and imaging flow cytometry, and the depletion of Rap1 by RNA interference significantly reduced the intracellular growth of <i>L. pneumophila</i> Thus, comparative proteomics identified Rap1 as a novel LCV host component implicated in intracellular replication of <i>L. pneumophila</i>.",

        "abstract": "Social organisms that cooperate with some members of their own species, such as close relatives, may fail to cooperate with other genotypes of the same species. Such noncooperation may take the form of outright antagonism or social exploitation. Myxococcus xanthus is a highly social prokaryote that cooperatively develops into spore-bearing, multicellular fruiting bodies in response to starvation. Here we have characterized the nature of social interactions among nine developmentally proficient strains of M. xanthus isolated from spatially distant locations. Strains were competed against one another in all possible pairwise combinations during starvation-induced development. In most pairings, at least one competitor exhibited strong antagonism toward its partner and a majority of mixes showed bidirectional antagonism that decreased total spore production, even to the point of driving whole populations to extinction. Differential response to mixing was the primary determinant of competitive superiority rather than the sporulation efficiencies of unmixed populations. In some competitive pairings, the dominant partner sporulated more efficiently in mixed populations than in clonal isolation. This finding represents a novel form of exploitation in bacteria carried out by socially competent genotypes and is the first documentation of social exploitation among natural bacterial isolates. Patterns of antagonistic superiority among these strains form a highly linear dominance hierarchy. At least some competition pairs construct chimeric, rather than segregated, fruiting bodies. The cooperative prokaryote M. xanthus has diverged into a large number of distinct social types that cooperate with clone-mates but exhibit intense antagonism toward distinct social types of the same species. Most lengthy migration events in nature may thus result in strong antagonism between migratory and resident populations, and this antagonism may have large effects on local population sizes and dynamics. Intense mutual antagonism appears to be more prevalent in this prokaryotic social species than has been observed in the eukaryotic social slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, which also exhibits multicellular development.

        "abstract": "Free-living protozoa allow horizontal gene transfer with and between the microorganisms that they host. They host mycobacteria for which the sources of transferred genes remain unknown. Using BLASTp, we searched within the genomes of 15 mycobacteria for homologous genes with 34 amoeba-resistant bacteria and the free-living protozoa Dictyostelium discoideum. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed that eight mycobacterial open-reading frames (ORFs) were probably acquired via horizontal transfer from beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria and from Firmicutes, but the transfer histories could not be reliably established in details. One further ORF encoding a pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase (pyr-redox) placed non-tuberculous mycobacteria in a clade with Legionella spp., Francisella spp., Coxiella burnetii, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and D. discoideum with a high reliability. Co-culturing Mycobacterium avium and Legionella pneumophila with the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga demonstrated that these two bacteria could live together in amoebae for five days, indicating the biological relevance of intra-amoebal transfer of the pyr-redox gene. In conclusion, the results of this study support the hypothesis that protists can serve as a source and a place for gene transfer in mycobacteria.",

        "abstract": "By engulfing potentially harmful microbes, professional phagocytes are continually at risk from intracellular pathogens. To avoid becoming infected, the host must kill pathogens in the phagosome before they can escape or establish a survival niche. Here, we analyse the role of the phosphoinositide (PI) 5-kinase PIKfyve in phagosome maturation and killing, using the amoeba and model phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum. PIKfyve plays important but poorly understood roles in vesicular trafficking by catalysing formation of the lipids phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)2) and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI(5)P). Here we show that its activity is essential during early phagosome maturation in Dictyostelium. Disruption of PIKfyve inhibited delivery of both the vacuolar V-ATPase and proteases, dramatically reducing the ability of cells to acidify newly formed phagosomes and digest their contents. Consequently, PIKfyve- cells were unable to generate an effective antimicrobial environment and efficiently kill captured bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate that cells lacking PIKfyve are more susceptible to infection by the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. We conclude that PIKfyve-catalysed phosphoinositide production plays a crucial and general role in ensuring early phagosomal maturation, protecting host cells from diverse pathogenic microbes.",

However, Dictyostelium discoideum cells lacking the phosducin-like protein PhLP1 display defective rather than enhanced G protein signaling. Here we show that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Gbeta (GFP-Gbeta) and GFP-Ggamma subunits exhibit drastically reduced steady-state levels and are absent from the plasma membrane in phlp1(-) cells. Triton X-114 partitioning suggests that lipid attachment to GFP-Ggamma occurs in wild-type cells but not in phlp1(-) and gbeta(-) cells. Moreover, Gbetagamma dimers could not be detected in vitro in coimmunoprecipitation assays with phlp1(-) cell lysates. Accordingly, in vivo diffusion measurements using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy showed that while GFP-Ggamma proteins are present in a complex in wild-type cells, they are free in phlp1(-) and gbeta(-) cells. Collectively, our data strongly suggest the absence of Gbetagamma dimer formation in Dictyostelium cells lacking PhLP1. We propose that PhLP1 serves as a cochaperone assisting the assembly of Gbeta and Ggamma into a functional Gbetagamma complex. Thus, phosducin family proteins may fulfill hitherto unsuspected biosynthetic functions.",

We find that the wave dynamics of the cytoskeletal components critically determine the traction force pattern, cell morphology, and migration mode. Furthermore, we find that fan-shaped cells can exhibit two different propulsion mechanisms, each with a distinct traction force pattern. Finally, the traction force patterns can be recapitulated using a computational model, which uses the experimentally determined spatiotemporal distributions of actin and myosin forces and a viscous cytoskeletal network. Our results suggest that cell motion can be generated by friction between the flow of this network and the substrate.",

The sensor kinase CbrA is a central regulator of carbon and nitrogen metabolism and in vitro also regulates virulence-related processes in P. aeruginosa. Here, we investigated the role of CbrA in two murine models of infection. In both peritoneal infections in leukopenic mice and lung infection models, the cbrA mutant was less virulent since substantially larger numbers of cbrA mutant bacteria were required to cause the same level of infection as wild-type or complemented bacteria. In contrast, in the chronic rat lung model the cbrA mutant grew and persisted as well as the wild type, indicating that the decrease of in vivo virulence of the cbrA mutant did not result from growth deficiencies on particular carbon substrates observed in vitro. In addition, a mutant in the cognate response regulator CbrB showed no defect in virulence in the peritoneal infection model, ruling out the involvement of certain alterations of virulence properties in the cbrA mutant including defective swarming motility, increased biofilm formation, and cytotoxicity, since these alterations are controlled through CbrB. Further investigations indicated that the mutant was more susceptible to uptake by phagocytes in vitro, resulting in greater overall bacterial killing. Consistent with the virulence defect, it took a smaller number of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae to kill the cbrA mutant than to kill the wild type. Transcriptional analysis of the cbrA mutant during D. discoideum infection led to the conclusion that CbrA played an important role in the iron metabolism, protection of P. aeruginosa against oxidative stress, and the regulation of certain virulence factors.",

These cells share remarkable similarities in the signaling pathways by which they control chemotaxis. They all use a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signal transduction pathway to sense the chemotactic gradient to guide cell migration. Diverse chemokines activate Rac through conserved GPCR signaling pathways. ELMO proteins are an evolutionarily conserved, essential component of the ELMO/Dock complex, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small G protein Rac activation. The linkages between the GPCR-initiated gradient sensing compass and the Rac-mediated migrating machinery have long been missing. Here, we summarize recent findings on ELMO proteins that directly interact with G protein and transduce GPCR signaling to control the reorganization of actin-based cytoskeleton through regulating Rac activation during chemotaxis, first in <i>D. discoideum</i> and then in mammalian cancer cells. This represents an evolutionarily conserved signaling shortcut from GPCR to the actin cytoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Novel chemical entities (NCEs) may be investigated for emetic liability in a range of unpleasant experiments involving retching, vomiting or conditioned taste aversion/food avoidance in sentient animals. We have used a range of compounds with known emetic /aversive properties to examine the possibility of using the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, for research into identifying and understanding emetic liability, and hence reduce adverse animal experimentation in this area. Twenty eight emetic or taste aversive compounds were employed to investigate the acute (10 min) effect of compounds on Dictyostelium cell behaviour (shape, speed and direction of movement) in a shallow chemotaxic gradient (Dunn chamber). Compound concentrations were chosen based on those previously reported to be emetic or aversive in in vivo studies and results were recorded and quantified by automated image analysis. Dictyostelium cell motility was rapidly and strongly inhibited by four structurally distinct tastants (three bitter tasting compounds--denatonium benzoate, quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiourea, and the pungent constituent of chilli peppers--capsaicin). In addition, stomach irritants (copper chloride and copper sulphate), and a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor also rapidly blocked movement. A concentration-dependant relationship was established for five of these compounds, showing potency of inhibition as capsaicin (IC(50) = 11.9 \u00b1 4.0 \u00b5M) > quinine hydrochloride (IC(50) = 44.3 \u00b1 6.8 \u00b5M) > denatonium benzoate (IC(50) = 129 \u00b1 4 \u00b5M) > phenylthiourea (IC(50) = 366 \u00b1 5 \u00b5M) > copper sulphate (IC(50) = 1433 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M). In contrast, 21 compounds within the cytotoxic and receptor agonist/antagonist classes did not affect cell behaviour. Further analysis of bitter and pungent compounds showed that the effect on cell behaviour was reversible and not cytotoxic, suggesting an uncharacterised molecular mechanism of action for these compounds. These results therefore demonstrate that Dictyostelium has potential as a non-sentient model in the analysis of the molecular effects of tastants, although it has limited utility in identification of emetic agents in general.",

We report that a developmentally regulated Na-H exchanger in Dictyostelium discoideum (DdNHE1) localizes to the leading edge of polarized cells and is necessary for intracellular pH homeostasis and for efficient chemotaxis. Starved DdNHE1-null cells (Ddnhe1(-)) differentiate, and in response to the chemoattractant cAMP they retain directional sensing; however, they cannot attain a polarized morphology, but instead extend mislocalized pseudopodia around the cell and exhibit decreased velocity. Consistent with impaired polarity, in response to chemoattractant, Ddnhe1(-) cells lack a leading edge localization of F-actin and have significantly attenuated de novo F-actin polymerization but increased abundance of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI((3,4,5))P(3)).

We investigated the role of two of the five Argonaute proteins of D. discoideum, AgnA and AgnB, in DIRS-1 silencing. Deletion of agnA resulted in the accumulation of DIRS-1 transcripts, the expression of DIRS-1-encoded proteins, and the loss of most DIRS-1-derived secondary siRNAs. Simultaneously, extrachromosomal single-stranded DIRS-1 DNA accumulated in the cytoplasm of agnA- strains. These DNA molecules appear to be products of reverse transcription and thus could represent intermediate structures before transposition. We further show that transitivity of endogenous siRNAs is impaired in agnA- strains. The deletion of agnB alone had no strong effect on DIRS-1 transposon regulation. However, in agnA-/agnB- double mutant strains strongly reduced accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA compared with the single agnA- strains was observed.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the \u03b3-secretase complex are strongly associated with familial Alzheimer disease. Both proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions for the \u03b3-secretase complex have been previously described in mammalian model organisms, but their relative contributions to disease pathology remain unclear. Here, we dissect the roles of orthologs of the \u03b3-secretase components in the model system <i>Dictyostelium</i>, focusing on endocytosis, lysosomal activity and autophagy. In this model, we show that the orthologs of PSEN (psenA and psenB), Ncstn (nicastrin) and Aph-1 (gamma-secretase subunit Aph-1), are necessary for optimal fluid-phase uptake by macropinocytosis and in multicellular development under basic pH conditions. Disruption of either psenA/B or Aph-1 proteins also leads to disrupted phagosomal proteolysis as well as decreased autophagosomal acidification and autophagic flux. This indicates a general defect in lysosomal trafficking and degradation, which we show leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in cells lacking psenA/B and Aph-1 proteins. Importantly, we find that all the endocytic defects observed in <i>Dictyostelium</i> PSEN ortholog mutants can be fully rescued by proteolytically inactive <i>Dictyostelium</i> psenB and human PSEN1 proteins. Our data therefore demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved non-proteolytic role for presenilin, and \u03b3-secretase component orthologs, in maintaining <i>Dictyostelium</i> lysosomal trafficking and autophagy. <b>Abbreviations:</b> Atg8: autophagy protein 8a; Aph-1: gamma-secretase subunit Aph-1; crtA: calreticulin; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GSK3B: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; Ncstn: nicastrin; PSEN1: presenilin 1; psenA and psenB: <i>Dictyostelium</i> presenilin A and B; TRITC; tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.",

We report that GtaC, a GATA transcription factor, exhibits rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to cAMP waves. This behavior requires coordinated action of a nuclear localization signal and reversible G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor-mediated phosphorylation. Although both are required for developmental gene expression, receptor occupancy promotes nuclear exit of GtaC, which leads to a transient burst of transcription at each cAMP cycle. We demonstrate that this biological circuit filters out high-frequency signals and counts those admitted, thereby enabling cells to modulate gene expression according to the dynamic pattern of the external stimuli.",

        "title": "Fitness Trade-offs Result in the Illusion of Social Success.",
        "abstract": "Cooperation is ubiquitous across the tree of life, from simple microbes to the complex social systems of animals. Individuals cooperate by engaging in costly behaviors that can be exploited by other individuals who benefit by avoiding these associated costs. Thus, if successful exploitation of social partners during cooperative interactions increases relative fitness, then we expect selection to lead to the emergence of a single optimal winning strategy in which individuals maximize their gain from cooperation while minimizing their associated costs. Such social \"cheating\" appears to be widespread in nature, including in several microbial systems, but despite the fitness advantages favoring social cheating, populations tend to harbor significant variation in social success rather than a single optimal winning strategy. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we provide a possible explanation for the coexistence of such variation. We find that genotypes typically designated as \"cheaters\" because they produce a disproportionate number of spores in chimeric fruiting bodies do not actually gain higher fitness as a result of this apparent advantage because they produce smaller, less viable spores than putative \"losers.\" As a consequence of this trade-off between spore number and viability, genotypes with different spore production strategies, which give the appearance of differential social success, ultimately have similar realized fitness. These findings highlight the limitations of using single fitness proxies in evolutionary studies and suggest that interpreting social trait variation in terms of strategies like cheating or cooperating may be misleading unless these behaviors are considered in the context of the true multidimensional nature of fitness.",

        "abstract": "Many signaling systems execute adaptation under circumstances that require noise attenuation. Here, we identify an intrinsic trade-off existing between sensitivity and noise attenuation in the three-node networks. We demonstrate that although fine-tuning timescales in three-node adaptive networks can partially mediate this trade-off in this context, it prolongs adaptation time and imposes unrealistic parameter constraints. By contrast, four-node networks can effectively decouple adaptation and noise attenuation to achieve dual function without a trade-off, provided that these functions are executed sequentially. We illustrate ideas in seven biological examples, including Dictyostelium discoideum chemotaxis and the p53 signaling network and find that adaptive networks are often associated with a noise attenuation module. Our approach may be applicable to finding network design principles for other dual and multiple functions.",

        "abstract": "In a role distinct from and perhaps more ancient than that in signal transduction, PIP3 and Ras help to spatially organize the actin cytoskeleton into macropinocytic cups. These large endocytic structures are extended by actin polymerization from the cell surface and have at their core an intense patch of active Ras and PIP3, around which actin polymerizes, creating cup-shaped projections. We hypothesize that active Ras and PIP3 self-amplify within macropinocytic cups, in a way that depends on the structural integrity of the cup. Signalling that triggers macropinocytosis may therefore be amplified downstream in a way that depends on macropinocytosis. This argument provides a context for recent findings that signalling to Akt (an effector of PIP3) is sensitive to cytoskeletal and macropinocytic inhibitors.",

Although aspects of this process are well studied, it is unclear how the cell controls the coordination of cell length changes with adhesion to the surface. Here, we develop a simple model to mechanistically explain the emergence of periodic changes in length and spatiotemporal dynamics of traction forces measured in chemotaxing unicellular amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. In contrast to the biochemical mechanisms that have been implicated in the coordination of some cellular processes, we show that many features of amoeboid locomotion emerge from a simple mechanochemical model. The mechanism for interaction with the environment in Dictyostelium is unknown and thus, we explore different cell-environment interaction models to reveal that mechanosensitive adhesions are necessary to reproduce the spatiotemporal adhesion patterns. In this modeling framework, we find that the other motility modes, such as smooth gliding, arise naturally with variations in the physical properties of the surface. Thus, our work highlights the prominent role of biomechanics in determining the emergent features of amoeboid locomotion.",

Here, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and other members of its genus are the leading causative agents. Attributes like their saprophytic life-style in various ecological niches coupled with nutritional flexibility and a broad host range have fostered the hypothesis that environmental predators could have been the actual target for some of their virulence determinants. In this mini review, we have merged the recent findings focused on the potential dual-use of fungal defense strategies against innate immune cells and soil amoebae as natural phagocytes. Well-established virulence attributes like the melanized surface of fungal conidia or their capacity to produce toxic secondary metabolites have also been found to be protective against the model amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Some of the recent advances during interaction studies with human cells have further promoted the adaptation of other amoeba infection models, including the wide-spread generalist <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i>, or less prominent representatives like <i>Vermamoeba vermiformis</i>. We further highlight prospects and limits of these natural phagocyte models with regard to the infection biology of filamentous fungi and in comparison to the phagocytes of the innate immune system.",

        "abstract": "Motile cells encounter microenvironments with locally heterogeneous mechanochemical composition. Individual compositional parameters, such as chemokines and extracellular matrix pore sizes, are well known to provide guidance cues for pathfinding. However, motile cells face diverse cues at the same time, raising the question of how they respond to multiple and potentially competing signals on their paths. Here, we reveal that amoeboid cells require nuclear repositioning, termed nucleokinesis, for adaptive pathfinding in heterogeneous mechanochemical micro-environments. Using mammalian immune cells and the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we discover that frequent, rapid and long-distance nucleokinesis is a basic component of amoeboid pathfinding, enabling cells to reorientate quickly between locally competing cues. Amoeboid nucleokinesis comprises a two-step polarity switch and is driven by myosin-II forces that readjust the nuclear to the cellular path. Impaired nucleokinesis distorts path adaptions and causes cellular arrest in the microenvironment. Our findings establish that nucleokinesis is required for amoeboid cell navigation. Given that many immune cells, amoebae, and some cancer cells utilize an amoeboid migration strategy, these results suggest that nucleokinesis underlies cellular navigation during unicellular biology, immunity, and disease.",

The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains four independently resolved molecules, highlighting regions that undergo large conformational changes. Differences are particularly pronounced in the actin binding region and the converter domain. The changes in position of the converter domain reflect movements both parallel to and perpendicular to the actin axis. The orientation of the converter domain is approximately 30 degrees further up than in other myosin structures, indicating that MyoE can produce a larger power stroke by rotating its lever arm through a larger angle. The role of extended loops near the actin-binding site is discussed in the context of cellular localization.

However, the dependence of chemoattractant induced changes in PI(3,4,5)P3 on PI3K and PTEN activities have not been defined. We find that bulk PI(3,4,5)P3 levels increase transiently upon chemoattractant stimulation, and the changes are greater and more prolonged in pten- cells. PI3K activation increases within 5 s of chemoattractant addition and then declines to a low level of activity identically in wild-type and pten- cells. Reconstitution of the PI3K activation profile can be achieved by mixing membranes from stimulated pi3k1-/pi3k2- cells with cytosolic PI3Ks from unstimulated cells. These studies show that significant control of chemotaxis occurs upstream of the PI3Ks and that regulation of the PI3Ks and PTEN cooperate to shape the temporal and spatial localization of PI(3,4,5)P3.",

We developed a model of actin waves in PTEN-deficient Dictyostelium discoideum by deriving an approximation of the dynamics of discrete actin filaments and combining it with a signaling pathway that controls filament branching. This signaling pathway, together with the actin network, contains a positive feedback loop that drives the actin waves. Our model predicts the structure, composition, and dynamics of waves that are consistent with existing experimental evidence, as well as the biochemical dependence on various protein partners. Simulation suggests that actin waves are initiated when local actin network activity, caused by an independent process, exceeds a certain threshold. Moreover, diffusion of proteins that form a positive feedback loop with the actin network alone is sufficient for propagation of actin waves at the observed speed of * 6 mm/min. Decay of the wave back can be caused by scarcity of network components, and the shape of actin waves is highly dependent on the filament disassembly rate. The model allows retraction of actin waves and captures formation of new wave fronts in broken waves. Our results demonstrate that a delicate balance between a positive feedback, filament disassembly, and local availability of network components is essential for the complex dynamics of actin waves.",

We have identified a DNA-binding activity specific for a highly A+T-enriched motif in the upstream region of the ACA-encoding gene, acaA. The factor shows DNA-binding characteristics very similar to those of C-module-binding factor (CbfA). Although CbfA was originally identified as a putative regulator of the activity of D. discoideum retrotransposon TRE5-A, it also was found to be essential for aggregation of D. discoideum cells. The identified DNA-binding activity was absent in mutant cells depleted of CbfA, and CbfA could be precipitated using an acaA promoter fragment. We propose that CbfA binds to the acaA promoter to provide a basal transcription activity that is required for induction of ACA expression after the onset of D. discoideum development.",

        "abstract": "The ability of Legionella pneumophila to proliferate within various protozoa in the aquatic environment and in macrophages indicates a remarkable evolution and microbial exploitation of evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic processes. Ankyrin B (AnkB) of L. pneumophila is a non-canonical F-box-containing protein, and is the only known Dot/Icm-translocated effector of L. pneumophila essential for intra-vacuolar proliferation within both macrophages and protozoan hosts. We show that the F-box domain of AnkB and the (9)L(10)P conserved residues are essential for intracellular bacterial proliferation and for rapid acquisition of polyubiquitinated proteins by the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) within macrophages, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Acanthamoeba. Interestingly, translocation of AnkB and recruitment of polyubiquitinated proteins in macrophages and Acanthamoeba is rapidly triggered by extracellular bacteria within 5 min of bacterial attachment. Ectopically expressed AnkB within mammalian cells is localized to the periphery of the cell where it co-localizes with host SKP1 and recruits polyubiquitinated proteins, which results in restoration of intracellular growth to the ankB mutant similar to the parental strain. While an ectopically expressed AnkB-(9)L(10)P/AA variant is localized to the cell periphery, it does not recruit polyubiquitinated proteins and fails to trans-rescue the ankB mutant intracellular growth defect. Direct in vivo interaction of AnkB but not the AnkB-(9)L(10)P/AA variant with the host SKP1 is demonstrated. Importantly, RNAi-mediated silencing of expression of SKP1 renders the cells non-permissive for intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila. The role of AnkB in exploitation of the polyubiquitination machinery is essential for intrapulmonary bacterial proliferation in the mouse model of Legionnaires' disease. Therefore, AnkB exhibits a novel molecular and functional mimicry of eukaryotic F-box proteins that exploits conserved polyubiquitination machinery for intracellular proliferation within evolutionarily distant hosts.",

Whether, like animals, amoebae also use tissue-level barriers to reduce direct contact with bacteria has remained unclear. We have explored this question in the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, which forms plaques on lawns of bacteria that expand as amoebae divide and bacteria are consumed. We show that CadA, a cell adhesion protein that functions in <i>D. discoideum</i> development, is also a bacterial agglutinin that forms a protective interface at the plaque edge that limits exposure of vegetative amoebae to bacteria. This interface is important for amoebal survival when bacteria-to-amoebae ratios are high, optimizing amoebal feeding behavior, and protecting amoebae from oxidative stress. Lectins also control bacterial access to the gut epithelium of mammals to limit inflammatory processes; thus, this strategy of antibacterial defense is shared across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic taxa.",

        "abstract": "Phagocytosis is a key process of the immune system. The human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well known example of a pathogen highly resistant to phagocytosis. A wealth of evidence demonstrates that the capsule polysaccharide (CPS) plays a crucial role in resistance to phagocytosis. The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum shares with mammalian macrophages the ability to phagocytose and kill bacteria. The fact that K. pneumoniae is ubiquitous in nature and, therefore, should avoid predation by amoebae, poses the question whether K. pneumoniae employs similar means to counteract amoebae and mammalian phagocytes. Here we developed an assay to evaluate K. pneumoniae-D. discoideum interaction. The richness of the growth medium affected the threshold at which the cps mutant was permissive for Dictyostelium and only at lower nutrient concentrations the cps mutant was susceptible to predation by amoebae. Given the critical role of bacterial surface elements on host-pathogen interactions, we explored the possible contribution of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to combat phagoyctosis by D. discoideum. We uncover that, in addition to the CPS, the LPS O-polysaccharide and the first core sugar participate in Klebsiella resistance to predation by D. discoideum. K. pneumoniae LPS lipid A decorations are also necessary to avoid predation by amoebae although PagP-dependent palmitoylation plays a more important role than the lipid A modification with aminoarabinose. Mutants lacking OMPs OmpA or OmpK36 were also permissive for D. discoideium growth. Except the LPS O-polysaccharide mutants, all mutants were more susceptible to phagocytosis by mouse alveolar macrophages. Finally, we found a correlation between virulence, using the pneumonia mouse model, and resistance to phagocytosis. Altogether, this work reveals novel K. pneumoniae determinants involved in resistance to phagocytosis and supports the notion that Dictyostelium amoebae might be useful as host model to measure K. pneumoniae virulence and not only phagocytosis.",

        "abstract": "For many years, Streptococcus anginosus has been considered a commensal colonizing the oral cavity, as well as the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. However, recent epidemiological and clinical data designate this bacterium as an emerging opportunistic pathogen. Despite the reported pathogenicity of S. anginosus, the molecular mechanism underpinning its virulence is poorly described. Therefore, our goal was to develop and optimize efficient and simple infection models that can be applied to examine the virulence of S. anginosus and to study host-pathogen interactions. Using 23 S. anginosus isolates collected from different infections, including severe and superficial infections, as well as an attenuated strain devoid of CppA, we demonstrate for the first time that Dictyostelium discoideum is a suitable model for initial, fast, and large-scale screening of virulence. Furthermore, we found that another nonvertebrate animal model, Galleria mellonella, can be used to study the pathogenesis of S. anginosus infection, with an emphasis on the interactions between the pathogen and host innate immunity. Examining the profile of immune defense genes, including antimicrobial peptides, opsonins, regulators of nodulation, and inhibitors of proteases, by quantitative PCR (qPCR) we identified different immune response profiles depending on the S. anginosus strain. Using these models, we show that S. anginosus is resistant to the bactericidal activity of phagocytes, a phenomenon confirmed using human neutrophils. Notably, since we found that the data from these models corresponded to the clinical severity of infection, we propose their further application to studies of the virulence of S. anginosus.",

        "abstract": "By limiting phosphotidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) levels, tumor suppressor PTEN not only controls cell growth but also maintains cell polarity required for cytokinesis and chemotaxis. To identify the critical targets of PIP(3) that link it to the cytoskeleton, we deleted secondary genes to reverse the deficiencies of pten- cells in Dictyostelium. The polarity defects in pten- cells correlate with elevated phosphorylations of PKB substrates. Deletion of AKT orthologue, PkbA, or a subunit of its activator TORC2, reduced the phosphorylations and suppressed the cytokinesis and chemotaxis defects in pten- cells. In these double mutants, the excessive PIP(3) levels and, presumably, activation of other PIP(3)-binding proteins had little or no effect on the cytoskeleton. In bands with increased phosphorylation in pten- cells, we found PKB substrates, PI5K, GefS, GacG, and PakA. Disruption of PakA in pten- cells restored a large fraction of the cells to normal behavior. Consistently, expression of phosphomimetic PakA in pten- cells exacerbated the defects but nonphosphorylatable PakA had no effect. Thus, among many putative PTEN- and PIP(3)-dependent events, phosphorylation of PKB substrates is the key downstream regulator of cell polarity.",

There is a pressing need for methods to manipulate wild type cells and ones with defects in macropinocytosis, neither of which can grow in liquid media. Here we present a panel of molecular genetic techniques based on the selection of Dictyostelium transfectants by growth on bacteria rather than liquid media. As well as extending the range of strains that can be manipulated, these techniques are faster than conventional methods, often giving usable numbers of transfected cells within a few days. The methods and plasmids described here allow efficient transfection with extrachromosomal vectors, as well as chromosomal integration at a 'safe haven' for relatively uniform cell-to-cell expression, efficient gene knock-in and knock-out and an inducible expression system. We have thus created a complete new system for the genetic manipulation of Dictyostelium cells that no longer requires cell feeding on liquid media.",

Unlike most chemotactic responses, ErkB phosphorylations are persistent and do not adapt to sustained stimulation with chemoattractant. ErkB\u00a0integrates dynamic autophosphorylation with chemotactic signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors. Downstream, our phosphoproteomics data define a broad panel of regulators of chemotaxis. Surprisingly, targets are almost exclusively other signaling proteins, rather than cytoskeletal components, revealing ErkB as a regulator of regulators rather than acting directly on the motility machinery. ErkB null cells migrate slowly and orientate poorly over broad dynamic ranges of chemoattractant. Our data indicate a central role for ErkB and its substrates in directing chemotaxis.",

We previously showed that the temporal and spatial activation of two protein kinase B (PKB) homologues, PkbA and PkbR1, in Dictyostelium discoideum by phosphorylation of activation loops (ALs) and hydrophobic motifs had important roles in chemotaxis. We found that hydrophobic motif phosphorylation depended on regulation of TorC2 (target of rapamycin complex 2); however, the regulation of AL phosphorylation remains to be determined at a molecular level. Here, we show that two PDK (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase) homologues, PdkA and PdkB, function as the key AL kinases. Cells lacking both PdkA and PdkB are defective in PKB activation, chemotaxis, and fruiting body formation upon nutrient deprivation. The pleckstrin homology domain of PdkA is sufficient to localize it to the membrane, but transient activation of PdkA is independent of PIP(3) as well as TorC2 and dispensable for full function. These results confirm the importance of the TorC2-PDK-PKB pathway in chemotaxis and point to a novel mechanism of regulation of PDKs by chemoattractant.",

The computational results suggest that the nucleoside monophosphate must be protonated for the forward reaction while it is unprotonated in the presence of aluminium fluoride, a popular transition state analog for phosphoryl transfer reactions. Furthermore, a compactification of the active site model system during the reaction and for the corresponding complex containing AlF3 was observed. For the active site residues that are part of the LID domain, conformational flexibility during the reaction proved to be crucial. On the basis of the calculations, a concerted phosphoryl transfer mechanism is suggested that involves the synchronous shift of a proton from the monophosphate to the transferred PO3-group. The proposed mechanism is thus analogous to the phosphoryl transfer mechanism in cAMP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates the hydroxyl groups of serine residues.",

Here, we developed a quantitative phosphoproteomic technique to discover signaling components. Using this approach, we discovered the long sought after folic acid receptor, fAR1, in D.\u00a0discoideum. We\u00a0showed that the seven-transmembrane receptor fAR1 is required for folic acid-mediated signaling events. Significantly, we discovered that fAR1 is essential for both chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria, thereby representing a chemoattractant GPCR that mediates not only chasing but also ingesting bacteria.

Specifically, we illustrate that efficient hydrolysis of ATP depends not only on the proper orientation of the lytic water but also on the structural stability of several nearby residues, especially the Arg238-Glu459 salt bridge (the numbering of residues follows myosin II in Dictyostelium discoideum) and the water molecule that spans this salt bridge and the lytic water. More importantly, by comparing the hydrolysis activities in two motor conformations with very similar active-site (i.e., Switches I and II) configurations, which distinguished this work from our previous study, the results clearly indicate that the ability of these residues to perform crucial electrostatic stabilization relies on the configuration of residues in the nearby N-terminus of the relay helix and the \"wedge loop.\" Without the structural support from those motifs, residues in a closed active site in the post-rigor motor domain undergo subtle structural variations that lead to consistently higher calculated ATP hydrolysis barriers than in the pre-powerstroke state. In other words, starting from the post-rigor state, turning on the ATPase activity requires not only displacement of Switch II to close the active site but also structural transitions in the N-terminus of the relay helix and the \"wedge loop,\" which have been proposed previously to be ultimately coupled to the rotation of the converter subdomain 40 A away.",

In this work, we have used a similar approach to express both human P2X4 (hP2X4) and Dictyostelium discoideum P2XA (DdP2XA) in Sf9 cells. Although hP2X4 did not form stable trimers in detergent solution, both receptors bound to ATP-coupled resins, indicating that their extracellular domains were folded correctly. DdP2XA formed strong trimers in detergent solution, and we were able to selectively purify trimers using preparative electrophoresis, and build a 21\u00c5-resolution 3D structure using transmission electron microscopy and single particle analysis. Although the structure of DdP2XA possessed similar dimensions to those of the previously determined low-resolution hP2X4 structure and the zfP2X4.1 crystal structure, N-glycosylation mutagenesis and molecular modeling indicated differences between N-glycan usage and predicted accessibility in models of DdP2XA based on the zfP2X4.1 crystal structure. Our data demonstrate that DdP2XA expressed in insect cells retains ATP-binding capacity after detergent solubilization, is an ideal candidate for structural study, and possesses a significantly different 3D structure to that of both hP2X4 and zfP2X4.1.",

        "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolase family 7 (GH7) cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) are enzymes commonly employed in plant cell wall degradation across eukaryotic kingdoms of life, as they provide significant hydrolytic potential in cellulose turnover. To date, many fungal GH7 CBHs have been examined, yet many questions regarding structure-activity relationships in these important natural and commercial enzymes remain. Here, we present the crystal structures and a biochemical analysis of two GH7 CBHs from social amoeba: Dictyostelium discoideum Cel7A (DdiCel7A) and Dictyostelium purpureum Cel7A (DpuCel7A). DdiCel7A and DpuCel7A natively consist of a catalytic domain and do not exhibit a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The structures of DdiCel7A and DpuCel7A, resolved to 2.1 \u00c5 and 2.7 \u00c5, respectively, are homologous to those of other GH7 CBHs with an enclosed active-site tunnel. Two primary differences between the Dictyostelium CBHs and the archetypal model GH7 CBH, Trichoderma reesei Cel7A (TreCel7A), occur near the hydrolytic active site and the product-binding sites. To compare the activities of these enzymes with the activity of TreCel7A, the family 1 TreCel7A CBM and linker were added to the C terminus of each of the Dictyostelium enzymes, creating DdiCel7ACBM and DpuCel7ACBM, which were recombinantly expressed in T. reesei DdiCel7ACBM and DpuCel7ACBM hydrolyzed Avicel, pretreated corn stover, and phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose as efficiently as TreCel7A when hydrolysis was compared at their temperature optima. The Ki of cellobiose was significantly higher for DdiCel7ACBM and DpuCel7ACBM than for TreCel7A: 205, 130, and 29 \u03bcM, respectively. Taken together, the present study highlights the remarkable degree of conservation of the activity of these key natural and industrial enzymes across quite distant phylogenetic trees of life.",

        "abstract": "The bacterium Vibrio cholerae, like other human pathogens that reside in environmental reservoirs, survives predation by unicellular eukaryotes. Strains of the O1 and O139 serogroups cause cholera, whereas non-O1/non-O139 strains cause human infections through poorly defined mechanisms. Using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, we have identified a virulence mechanism in a non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strain that involves extracellular translocation of proteins that lack N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequences. Accordingly, we have named these genes \"VAS\" genes for virulence-associated secretion, and we propose that these genes encode a prototypic \"type VI\" secretion system. We show that vas genes are required for cytotoxicity of V. cholerae cells toward Dictyostelium amoebae and mammalian J774 macrophages by a contact-dependent mechanism. A large number of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens carry genes homologous to vas genes and potential effector proteins secreted by this pathway (i.e., hemolysin-coregulated protein and VgrG). Mutations in vas homologs in other bacterial species have been reported to attenuate virulence in animals and cultured macrophages. Thus, the genes encoding the VAS-related, type VI secretion system likely play an important conserved function in microbial pathogenesis and represent an additional class of targets for vaccine and antimicrobial drug-based therapies.",

Only recently, Tsps have started to acquire relevance as potential new drug targets as they contribute, via protein-protein interactions, to numerous pathophysiological processes including infectious diseases and cancer. However, due to a high number of isoforms and functional redundancy, knowledge on specific functions of most Tsps is still scarce. We set out to characterize five previously annotated Tsps, TspA-E, from Dictyostelium discoideum, a model for studying proteins that have human orthologues. Using reverse transcriptase PCRs, we found mRNAs for TspA-E in the multicellular slug stage, whereas vegetative cells expressed only TspA, TspC and, to a lesser extent, TspD. We raised antibodies against TspA, TspC and TspD and detected endogenous TspA, as well as heterologously expressed TspA and TspC by Western blot. N-deglycosylation assays and mutational analyses showed glycosylation of TspA and TspC in vivo. GFP-tagged Tsps co-localized with the proton pump on the contractile vacuole network. Deletion strains of TspC and TspD exibited unaltered growth, adhesion, random motility and development. Yet, tspC- cells showed a defect in coping with hypo-osmotic stress, due to accumulation of contractile vacuoles, but heterologous expression of TspC rescued their phenotype. In conclusion, our data fill a gap in Dictyostelium research and open up the possibility that Tsps in contractile vacuoles of e.g. Trypanosoma may one day constitute a valuable drug target for treating sleeping sickness, one of the most threatening tropical diseases.",

Here we report that circular RNA isoforms are found in diverse species whose most recent common ancestor existed more than one billion years ago: fungi (Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), and protists (Plasmodium falciparum and Dictyostelium discoideum). For all species studied to date, including those in this report, only a small fraction of the theoretically possible circular RNA isoforms from a given gene are actually observed. Unlike metazoans, Arabidopsis, D. discoideum, P. falciparum, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe have very short introns (\u223c 100 nucleotides or shorter), yet they still produce circular RNAs. A minority of genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products of alternative splicing or 'piggyback' on signals used in alternative RNA processing. In S. pombe, the relative abundance of circular to linear transcript isoforms changed in a gene-specific pattern during nitrogen starvation. Circular RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs.",

        "abstract": "Chemotactic cells, including neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum, orient and move directionally in very shallow chemical gradients. As cells polarize, distinct structural and signaling components become spatially constrained to the leading edge or rear of the cell. It has been suggested that complex feedback loops that function downstream of receptor signaling integrate activating and inhibiting pathways to establish cell polarity within such gradients. Much effort has focused on defining activating pathways, whereas inhibitory networks have remained largely unexplored. We have identified a novel signaling function in Dictyostelium involving a Galpha subunit (Galpha9) that antagonizes broad chemotactic response. Mechanistically, Galpha9 functions rapidly following receptor stimulation to negatively regulate PI3K/PTEN, adenylyl cyclase, and guanylyl cyclase pathways. The coordinated activation of these pathways is required to establish the asymmetric mobilization of actin and myosin that typifies polarity and ultimately directs chemotaxis. Most dramatically, cells lacking Galpha9 have extended PI(3,4,5)P(3), cAMP, and cGMP responses and are hyperpolarized. In contrast, cells expressing constitutively activated Galpha9 exhibit a reciprocal phenotype. Their second message pathways are attenuated, and they have lost the ability to suppress lateral pseudopod formation. Potentially, functionally similar Galpha-mediated inhibitory signaling may exist in other eukaryotic cells to regulate chemoattractant response.",

        "abstract": "Phagocytic cells capture and kill most invader microbes within the bactericidal phagosome, but some pathogens subvert killing by damaging the compartment and escaping to the cytosol. To prevent the leakage of pathogen virulence and host defence factors, as well as bacteria escape, host cells have to contain and repair the membrane damage, or finally eliminate the cytosolic bacteria. All eukaryotic cells engage various repair mechanisms to ensure plasma membrane integrity and proper compartmentalization of organelles, including the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) and autophagy machineries. We show that during infection of Dictyostelium discoideum with Mycobacterium marinum, the ESCRT-I component Tsg101, the ESCRT-III protein Snf7/Chmp4/Vps32 and the AAA-ATPase Vps4 are recruited to sites of damage at the Mycobacterium-containing vacuole. Interestingly, damage separately recruits the ESCRT and the autophagy machineries. In addition, the recruitment of Vps32 and Vps4 to repair sterile membrane damage depends on Tsg101 but appears independent of Ca2+. Finally, in absence of Tsg101, M. marinum accesses prematurely the cytosol, where the autophagy machinery restricts its growth. We propose that ESCRT has an evolutionary conserved function to repair small membrane damage and to contain intracellular pathogens in intact compartments.",

This led us to analyze autophagy in a number of multitipped mutants described previously (tipA(-), tipB(-), tipC(-), and tipD(-)). We found a clear autophagic dysfunction in tipC(-) and tipD(-) while the others showed no defects. tipD codes for a homolog of Atg16, which confirms the role of this protein in Dictyostelium autophagy and validates our approach. The tipC-encoded protein is highly similar to human VPS13A (also known as chorein), whose mutations cause the chorea-acanthocytosis syndrome. No member of the VPS13 protein family has been previously related to autophagy despite the presence of a region of similarity to Atg2 at the C terminus. This region also contains the conserved domain of unknown function DUF1162. Of interest, the expression of the TipC C-terminal coding sequence containing these 2 motifs largely complemented the mutant phenotype. Dictyostelium cells lacking TipC displayed a reduced number of autophagosomes visualized with the markers GFP-Atg18 and GFP-Atg8 and an impaired autophagic degradation as determined by a proteolytic cleavage assay.

        "abstract": "Signaling cascades are initiated in the plasma membrane via activation of one molecule by another. The interaction depends on the mutual availability of the molecules to each other and this is determined by their localization and lateral diffusion in the cell membrane. The cytoskeleton plays a very important role in this process by enhancing or restricting the possibility of the signaling partners to meet in the plasma membrane. In this study we explored the mode of diffusion of the cAMP receptor, cAR1, in the plasma membrane of Dictyostelium discoideum cells and how this is regulated by the cytoskeleton. Single-particle tracking of fluorescently labeled cAR1 using Total Internal Reflection Microscopy showed that 70% of the cAR1 molecules were mobile. These receptors showed directed motion and we demonstrate that this is not because of tracking along the actin cytoskeleton. Instead, destabilization of the microtubules abolished cAR1 mobility in the plasma membrane and this was confirmed by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching. As a result of microtubule stabilization, one of the first downstream signaling events, the jump of the PH domain of CRAC, was decreased. These results suggest a role for microtubules in cAR1 dynamics and in the ability of cAR1 molecules to interact with their signaling partners.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is one of the most famous model organisms for studying motile processes like cell movement, organelle transport, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. Members of the myosin superfamily, that move on actin filaments and power many of these tasks, are tripartite proteins consisting of a conserved catalytic domain followed by the neck region consisting of a different number of so-called IQ motifs for binding of light chains. The tails contain functional motifs that are responsible for the accomplishment of the different tasks in the cell. Unicellular organisms like yeasts contain three to five myosins while vertebrates express over 40 different myosin genes. Recently, the question has been raised how many myosins a simple multicellular organism like Dictyostelium would need to accomplish all the different motility-related tasks.",

        "abstract": "Dynein interacts with microtubules through a dedicated binding domain that is dynamically controlled to achieve high or low affinity, depending on the state of nucleotide bound in a distant catalytic pocket. The active sites for microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis communicate via conformational changes transduced through a approximately 10-nm length antiparallel coiled-coil stalk, which connects the binding domain to the roughly 300-kDa motor core. Recently, an x-ray structure of the murine cytoplasmic dynein microtubule binding domain (MTBD) in a weak affinity conformation was published, containing a covalently constrained beta(+) registry for the coiled-coil stalk segment (Carter, A. P., Garbarino, J. E., Wilson-Kubalek, E. M., Shipley, W. E., Cho, C., Milligan, R. A., Vale, R. D., and Gibbons, I. R. (2008) Science 322, 1691-1695). We here present an NMR analysis of the isolated MTBD from Dictyostelium discoideum that demonstrates the coiled-coil beta(+) registry corresponds to the low energy conformation for this functional region of dynein. Addition of sequence encoding roughly half of the coiled-coil stalk proximal to the binding tip results in a decreased affinity of the MTBD for microtubules. In contrast, addition of the complete coiled-coil sequence drives the MTBD to the conformationally unstable, high affinity binding state. These results suggest a thermodynamic coupling between conformational free energy differences in the alpha and beta(+) registries of the coiled-coil stalk that acts as a switch between high and low affinity conformations of the MTBD. A balancing of opposing conformations in the stalk and MTBD enables potentially modest long-range interactions arising from ATP binding in the motor core to induce a relaxation of the MTBD into the stable low affinity state.",

        "abstract": "Much of what we know about the evolution of altruism comes from animals. Here, we show that studying a microbe has yielded unique insights, particularly in understanding how social cheaters are controlled. The social stage of Dictylostelium discoideum occurs when the amoebae run out of their bacterial prey and aggregate into a multicellular, motile slug. This slug forms a fruiting body in which about a fifth of cells die to form a stalk that supports the remaining cells as they form hardy dispersal-ready spores. Because this social stage forms from aggregation, it is analogous to a social group, or a chimeric multicellular organism, and is vulnerable to internal conflict. Advances in cell labeling, microscopy, single-gene knockouts, and genomics, as well as the results of decades of study of D. discoideum as a model for development, allow us to explore the genetic basis of social contests and control of cheaters in unprecedented detail. Cheaters are limited from exploiting other clones by high relatedness, kin discrimination, pleiotropy, noble resistance, and lottery-like role assignment. The active nature of these limits is reflected in the elevated rates of change in social genes compared with nonsocial genes. Despite control of cheaters, some conflict is still expressed in chimeras, with slower movement of slugs, slightly decreased investment in stalk compared with spore cells, and differential contributions to stalk and spores. D. discoideum is rapidly becoming a model system of choice for molecular studies of social evolution.",

        "abstract": "The oscillation of chemoattractant cyclic AMP (cAMP) in Dictyostelium discoideum is a collective phenomenon that occurs when the basal level of extracellular cAMP exceeds a threshold and invokes cooperative mutual excitation of cAMP synthesis and secretion. For pulses to be relayed from cell to cell repetitively, secreted cAMP must be cleared and brought down to the subthreshold level. One of the main determinants of the oscillatory behavior is thus how much extracellular cAMP is degraded by extracellular phosphodiesterase (PDE). To date, the exact nature of PDE gene regulation remains elusive. Here, we performed live imaging analysis of mRNA transcripts for pdsA--the gene encoding extracellular PDE. Our analysis revealed that pdsA is upregulated during the rising phase of cAMP oscillations. Furthermore, by analyzing isolated cells, we show that expression of pdsA is strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular cAMP. pdsA is induced only at \u223c1 nM extracellular cAMP, which is almost identical to the threshold concentration for the cAMP relay response. The observed precise regulation of PDE expression together with degradation of extracellular cAMP by PDE form a dual positive and negative feedback circuit, and model analysis shows that this sets the cAMP level near the threshold concentration for the cAMP relay response for a wide range of adenylyl cyclase activity. The overlap of the thresholds could allow oscillations of chemoattractant cAMP to self-organize at various starving conditions, making its development robust to fluctuations in its environment.",

DIF-1 and its derivative, DIF-1(3M) promote glucose consumption in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in diabetic rats; they are expected to be the leading antiobesity and antidiabetes compounds. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the actions of DIF-1 and DIF-1(3M). In isolated mouse liver mitochondria, these compounds at 2-20 \u03bcM promoted oxygen consumption in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that they act as mitochondrial uncouplers, whereas CP-DIF-1 (another derivative of DIF-1) at 10-20 \u03bcM had no effect. In confluent mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, DIF-1 and DIF-1(3M) but not CP-DIF-1 induced phosphorylation (and therefore activation) of AMP kinase (AMPK) and promoted glucose consumption and metabolism. The DIF-induced glucose consumption was reduced by compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) or AMPK knock down. These data suggest that DIF-1 and DIF-1(3M) promote glucose uptake, at least in part, via an AMPK-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 cells, whereas cellular metabolome analysis revealed that DIF-1 and DIF-1(3M) may act differently at least in part.",

We also demonstrate that the polarization of the EMV protein-sorting pathway can occur in morphologically non-polarized cells, defines the site of uropod formation, is induced by increased expression of EMV cargo proteins, and is evolutionarily conserved between humans and the protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism of posterior pole biogenesis in which elevated levels of EMV cargoes (i) polarize the EMV protein-sorting pathway, (ii) generate a nascent posterior pole, and (iii) prime cells for signal-induced biogenesis of a uropod. This model also offers a mechanistic explanation for the polarized budding of EMVs and retroviruses, including HIV.",

Here we provide evidence that both inverted terminal repeats have strong promoter activity and that bidirectional expression apparently generates a substrate for Dicer. A cassette containing the inverted terminal repeats and a fragment of a gene of interest was sufficient to activate the RNAi response, resulting in the generation of ~21 nt siRNAs, a reduction of mRNA and protein expression of the respective endogene. Surprisingly, no transitivity was observed on the endogene. This was in contrast to previous observations, where endogenous siRNAs caused spreading on an artificial transgene. Knock-down was successful on seven target genes that we examined. In three cases a phenotypic analysis proved the efficiency of the approach. One of the target genes was apparently essential because no knock-out could be obtained; the RNAi mediated knock-down, however, resulted in a very slow growing culture indicating a still viable reduction of gene expression. ADVANTAGES OF THE DIRS-1\u2013RNAI SYSTEM: The knock-down system required a short DNA fragment (~400 bp) of the target gene as an initial trigger. Further siRNAs were generated by RdRPs since we have shown some siRNAs with a 5'-triphosphate group. Extrachromosomal vectors facilitate the procedure and allowed for molecular and phenotypic analysis within one week. The system provides an efficient and rapid method to reduce protein levels including those of essential genes.",

This atypical phagocytic activity is a crucial survival option for tumours in conditions of low nutrient supply, and has some similarities to the phagocytic activity of unicellular microorganisms. In fact, Dictyostelium discoideum has been used widely as a model to study phagocytosis. Recently, phg1A has been described as a protein that is primarily involved in the phagocytic process of this microorganism. The closest human homologue to phg1A is transmembrane 9 superfamily protein member 4 (TM9SF4). Here, we report that TM9SF4 is highly expressed in human malignant melanoma cells deriving from metastatic lesions, whereas it is undetectable in healthy human tissues and cells. TM9SF4 is predominantly expressed in acidic vesicles of melanoma cells, in which it co-localizes with the early endosome antigens Rab5 and early endosome antigen 1. TM9SF4 silencing induced marked inhibition of cannibal activity, which is consistent with a derangement of intracellular pH gradients, with alkalinization of acidic vesicles and acidification of the cell cytosol.

Moreover, this domain shows a stable intermediate along its mechanical unfolding pathway. We have developed a mechanical single-molecule analogue to a double-jump stopped-flow experiment to investigate the folding kinetics and pathway of this domain. We show that an obligatory and productive intermediate also occurs on the folding pathway of the domain. Identical mechanical properties suggest that the unfolding and refolding intermediates are closely related. The folding process can be divided into two consecutive steps: in the first step 60 C-terminal amino acids form an intermediate at the rate of 55 s(-1); and in the second step the remaining 40 amino acids are packed on this core at the rate of 179 s(-1). This division increases the overall folding rate of this domain by a factor of ten compared with all other homologous domains of ddFLN that lack the folding intermediate.",

RasG is unable to substitute for this requirement despite its sequence similarity to RasC. A critical question is which amino acids in RasC are required for its specific function. Each of the amino acids within the switch 1 and 2 domains in the N-terminal portion of RasG was changed to the corresponding amino acid from RasC, and the ability of the mutated RasG protein to reverse the phenotype of rasC(-) cells was determined. Only the change from aspartate at position 30 of RasG to alanine (the equivalent position 31 in RasC) resulted in a significant increase in adenylyl cyclase A activation and a partial reversal of the aggregation-deficient phenotype of rasC(-) cells. All other single amino acid changes were without effect. Expression of a chimeric protein, RasG(1-77)-RasC(79-189), also resulted in a partial reversal of the rasC(-) cell phenotype, indicating the importance of the C-terminal portion of RasC. Furthermore, expression of the chimeric protein, with alanine changed to aspartate (RasG(1-77(D30A))-RasC(79-189)), resulted in a full rescue the rasC(-) aggregation-deficient phenotype. Finally, the expression of either a mutated RasC, with the aspartate 31 replaced by alanine, or the chimeric protein, RasC(1-78)-RasG(78-189), only generated a partial rescue. These results emphasize the importance of both the single amino acid at position 31 and the C-terminal sequence for the specific function of RasC during Dictyostelium aggregation.",

        "abstract": "Organisms often cooperate through the production of freely available public goods. This can greatly benefit the group but is vulnerable to the \"tragedy of the commons\" if individuals lack the motivation to make the necessary investment into public goods production. Relatedness to groupmates can motivate individual investment because group success ultimately benefits their genes' own self-interests. However, systems often lack mechanisms that can reliably ensure that relatedness is high enough to promote cooperation. Consequently, groups face a persistent threat from the tragedy unless they have a mechanism to enforce investment when relatedness fails to provide adequate motivation. To understand the real threat posed by the tragedy and whether groups can avert its impact, we determine how the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> responds as relatedness decreases to levels that should induce the tragedy. We find that, while investment in public goods declines as overall within-group relatedness declines, groups avert the expected catastrophic collapse of the commons by continuing to invest, even when relatedness should be too low to incentivize any contribution. We show that this is due to a developmental buffering system that generates enforcement because insufficient cooperation perturbs the balance of a negative feedback system controlling multicellular development. This developmental constraint enforces investment under the conditions expected to be most tragic, allowing groups to avert a collapse in cooperation. These results help explain how mechanisms that suppress selfishness and enforce cooperation can arise inadvertently as a by-product of constraints imposed by selection on different traits.",

        "abstract": "The subcomplex of Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits of RNA pol II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to be an important determinant of transcription under a variety of physiological stresses. In S.cerevisiae, RPB7 is essential for cell viability while rpb4 null strains are temperature sensitive at low and high temperatures. The rpb4 null strain also shows defect in sporulation and a predisposed state of pseudohyphal growth. We show here that, apart from S.cerevisiae Rpb7, the Rpb7 homologs from other lower eukaryotes like Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans and Dictyostelium discoideum can complement for the absence of S.cerevisiae RPB7. This is the first report where we have shown that both the C.albicans and D.discoideum homologs are functional orthologs of the yeast RPB7. We also show that high expression levels of S.cerevisiae RPB7 and its homologs rescue the sporulation defect of rpb4 homozygous null diploids, but only some of them cause significant enhancement of the pseudohyphal phenotype. Structural modeling of Rpb7 and its homologs show a high degree of conservation in the overall structure. This study indicates a structural and functional conservation of different Rpb7 across species and also a conserved role of Rpb7 in the subcomplex with respect to nutritional stress.",

MHCK A is a member of the atypical alpha-kinase family of serine and threonine protein kinases and displays no sequence homology to typical eukaryotic protein kinases. We report the crystal structure of the alpha-kinase domain (A-CAT) of MHCK A. When crystallized in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), A-CAT contained adenosine monophosphate (AMP) at the active site. However, when crystallized in the presence of ATP and a peptide substrate, which does not appear in the structure, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was found at the active site and an invariant aspartic acid residue (Asp(766)) at the active site was phosphorylated. The aspartylphosphate group was exposed to the solvent within an active-site pocket that might function as a docking site for substrates. Access to the aspartylphosphate was regulated by a conformational switch in a loop that bound to a magnesium ion (Mg(2+)), providing a mechanism that allows alpha-kinases to sense and respond to local changes in Mg(2+).",

        "abstract": "Telomerase, particularly its main subunit, the reverse transcriptase, TERT, prevents DNA erosion during eukaryotic chromosomal replication, but also has poorly understood non-canonical functions. Here, in the model social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we show that the protein encoded by tert has telomerase-like motifs, and regulates, non-canonically, important developmental processes. Expression levels of wild-type (WT) tert were biphasic, peaking at 8 and 12 h post-starvation, aligning with developmental events, such as the initiation of streaming (~7 h) and mound formation (~10 h). In tert KO mutants, however, aggregation was delayed until 16 h. Large, irregular streams formed, then broke up, forming small mounds. The mound-size defect was not induced when a KO mutant of countin (a master size-regulating gene) was treated with TERT inhibitors, but anti-countin antibodies did rescue size in the tert KO. Although, conditioned medium (CM) from countin mutants failed to rescue size in the tert KO, tert KO CM rescued the countin KO phenotype. These and additional observations indicate that TERT acts upstream of smlA/countin: (i) the observed expression levels of smlA and countin, being respectively lower and higher (than WT) in the tert KO; (ii) the levels of known size-regulation intermediates, glucose (low) and adenosine (high), in the tert mutant, and the size defect's rescue by supplemented glucose or the adenosine-antagonist, caffeine; (iii) the induction of the size defect in the WT by tert KO CM and TERT inhibitors. The tert KO's other defects (delayed aggregation, irregular streaming) were associated with changes to cAMP-regulated processes (e.g. chemotaxis, cAMP pulsing) and their regulatory factors (e.g. cAMP; acaA, carA expression). Overexpression of WT tert in the tert KO rescued these defects (and size), and restored a single cAMP signaling centre. Our results indicate that TERT acts in novel, non-canonical and upstream ways, regulating key developmental events in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "The development of Dictyostelium discoideum is a model for tissue size regulation, as these cells form groups of approximately 2 x 10(4) cells. The group size is regulated in part by a negative feedback pathway mediated by a secreted multipolypeptide complex called counting factor (CF). CF signal transduction involves decreasing intracellular CF glucose levels. A component of CF, countin, has the bioactivity of the entire CF complex, and an 8-min exposure of cells to recombinant countin decreases intracellular glucose levels. To understand how CF regulates intracellular glucose, we examined the effect of CF on enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. Exposure of cells to CF has little effect on amylase or glycogen phosphorylase, enzymes involved in glucose production from glycogen. Glucokinase activity (the first specific step of glycolysis) is inhibited by high levels of CF but is not affected by an 8-min exposure to countin. The second enzyme specific for glycolysis, phosphofructokinase, is not regulated by CF. There are two corresponding enzymes in the gluconeogenesis pathway, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. The first is not regulated by CF or countin, whereas glucose-6-phosphatase is regulated by both CF and an 8-min exposure to countin. The countin-induced changes in the Km and Vmax of glucose-6-phosphatase cause a decrease in glucose production that can account for the countin-induced decrease in intracellular glucose levels. It thus appears that part of the CF signal transduction pathway involves inhibiting the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase, decreasing intracellular glucose levels and affecting the levels of other metabolites, to regulate group size.",

To understand genome evolution over long time periods and the genetic basis of social evolution, we sequenced the genomes of Dictyostelium fasciculatum (DF) and Polysphondylium pallidum (PP), which represent the early diverging groups 1 and 2, respectively. In contrast to DD, PP and DF have conventional telomere organization and strongly reduced numbers of transposable elements. The number of protein-coding genes is similar between species, but only half of them comprise an identifiable set of orthologous genes. In general, genes involved in primary metabolism, cytoskeletal functions and signal transduction are conserved, while genes involved in secondary metabolism, export, and signal perception underwent large differential gene family expansions. This most likely signifies involvement of the conserved set in core cell and developmental mechanisms, and of the diverged set in niche- and species-specific adaptations for defense and food, mate, and kin selection. Phylogenetic dating using a concatenated data set and extensive loss of synteny indicate that DF, PP, and DD split from their last common ancestor at least 0.6 billion years ago.",

        "abstract": "Myosin II filament assembly in Dictyostelium discoideum is regulated via phosphorylation of residues located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the myosin II heavy chain (MHC) tail. A series of novel protein kinases in this system are capable of phosphorylating these residues in vitro, driving filament disassembly. Previous studies have demonstrated that at least three of these kinases (MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C) display differential localization patterns in living cells. We have created a collection of single, double, and triple gene knockout cell lines for this family of kinases. Analysis of these lines reveals that three MHC kinases appear to represent the majority of cellular activity capable of driving myosin II filament disassembly, and reveals that cytokinesis defects increase with the number of kinases disrupted. Using biochemical fractionation of cytoskeletons and in vivo measurements via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we find that myosin II overassembly increases incrementally in the mutants, with the MHCK A(-)/B(-)/C(-) triple mutant showing severe myosin II overassembly. These studies suggest that the full complement of MHC kinases that significantly contribute to growth phase and cytokinesis myosin II disassembly in this organism has now been identified.",

Their conservation was originally established on minimal versions lacking the tertiary interactions. While those sequence requirements in general also apply to natural versions, we show here differences for the HHRz cleavage site N17. A guanosine at this position strongly impairs cleavage activity in minimal versions, whereas we observe for the G17 variants of four tertiary stabilized HHRz significant cleavage and ligation activity in vitro. Kinetic analyses of these variants revealed a reduced rate and extent of cleavage, compared with wild-type sequences, while variants with distorted tertiary interactions cleaved at a reduced rate, but to the same extent. Contrary to this, G17 variants exhibit similar in vitro ligation activity as compared with the respective wild-type motif. To also address the catalytic performance of these motifs in vivo, we have inserted HHRz cassettes in the lacZ gene and tested this \u03b2-galactosidase reporter in Dictyostelium discoideum. In colorimetric assays, we observe differences in the enzymatic activity of \u03b2-galactosidase, which correlate well with the activity of the different HHRz variants in vitro and which can be unambiguously attributed to ribozyme cleavage by primer extension analysis.",

In vegetative Dictyostelium cells, GFP molecules experience a 3.6-fold reduction of their translational mobility relative to dilute aqueous solutions. In disrupting the actin filamentous network using latrunculin-A, the intact actin cytoskeletal network is shown to contribute an effective viscosity of 1.36 cP, which accounts for 53% of the restrained molecular diffusion of GFP. The remaining 47% of hindered protein motions is ascribed to other mechanical barriers and the viscosity of the cell liquid. A direct correlation between the density of the actin network and its limiting action on protein diffusion is furthermore established from measurements under different osmotic conditions. In highly locomotive polarized cells, the obstructing effect of the actin filamentous network is seen to decline to 0.46 cP in the non-cortical regions of the cell. Our results indicate that the meshwork of actin filaments constitutes the primary mechanical barrier for protein diffusion and that any noticeable reorganization of the network is accompanied by altered intracellular protein mobility.",

We assayed Dictyostelium lysates to demonstrate the presence of a highly active phospholipase B (PLB) enzyme that removed both fatty-acid chains from phosphatidylcholine and produced the water-soluble glycerophosphorylcholine. We purified the PLB activity from Dictyostelium cytosol using standard agarose media (size exclusion and ion exchange), and combined this with an affinity purification step using myristoylated ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1), a protein which has a single fatty acid at its N-terminus. Two proteins co-purified (48 kDa and 65 kDa), and the 48 kDa protein was digested with trypsin, peptide fragments were separated by reverse-phase chromatography, and the resultant peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation. From the peptide sequences obtained, database searches revealed a gene which encodes a protein of 65 kDa with unknown function. The 48 kDa protein therefore appears to be a fragment of the full-length 65 kDa product. Expression of the gene in Escherichia coli confirmed that it encodes a PLB. Characterization of its substrate specificity indicated that, in addition to phosphatidylcholine deacylation, the enzyme also hydrolysed phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The PLB identified in the present study is not related to existing PLBs found in bacteria, fungi or mammals. There are, however, genes similar to Dictyostelium PLB in mammals, flies, worms and Giardia, but not in yeast. We therefore have identified a novel family of intracellular PLBs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we established, validated, and optimized a novel computational framework for tracing arbitrarily oriented actin filaments in cryo-electron tomography maps. Our approach was designed for highly complex intracellular architectures in which a long-range cytoskeleton network extends throughout the cell bodies and protrusions. The irregular organization of the actin network, as well as cryo-electron-tomography-specific noise, missing wedge artifacts, and map dimensions call for a specialized implementation that is both robust and efficient. Our proposed solution, <i>Struwwel Tracer</i>, accumulates densities along paths of a specific length in various directions, starting from locally determined seed points. The highest-density paths originating from the seed points form short linear candidate filament segments, which are further scrutinized and classified by users via inspection of a novel <i>pruning map</i>, which visualizes the likelihood of being a part of longer filaments. The pruned linear candidate filament segments are then iteratively fused into continuous, longer, and curved filaments based on their relative orientations, gap spacings, and extendibility. When applied to the simulated phantom tomograms of a <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> filopodium under experimental conditions, <i>Struwwel Tracer</i> demonstrated high efficacy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.85 to 0.90, depending on the noise level. Furthermore, when applied to a previously untraced experimental tomogram of mouse fibroblast lamellipodia, the filaments predicted by <i>Struwwel Tracer</i> exhibited a good visual agreement with the experimental map. The <i>Struwwel Tracer</i> framework is highly time efficient and can complete the tracing process in just a few minutes.

The group size is regulated in part by a negative feedback pathway mediated by a secreted multipolypeptide complex called counting factor (CF). The CF signal transduction pathway involves CF-repressing internal glucose levels by increasing the K(m) of glucose-6-phosphatase. Little is known about how this enzyme is regulated. Glucose-6-phosphatase is associated with microsomes in both Dictyostelium and mammals. We find that the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in crude microsomes from cells with high, normal, or low CF activity had a negative correlation with the amount of CF present in these cell lines. In crude cytosols (supernatants from ultracentrifugation of cell lysates), the glucose-6-phosphatase activity had a positive correlation with CF accumulation. The crude cytosols were further fractionated into a fraction containing molecules greater than 10 kDa (S>10K) and molecules less than 10 KDa (S<10K). S>10K from wild-type cells strongly repressed the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type microsomes, whereas S>10K from countin(-) cells (cells with low CF activity) significantly increased the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type microsomes by decreasing K(m). The regulatory activities in the wild-type and countin(-) S>10Ks are heat-labile and protease-sensitive, suggesting that they are proteins. S<10K from both wild-type and countin(-) cells did not significantly change glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Together, the data suggest that, as a part of a pathway modulating multicellular group size, CF regulates one or more proteins greater than 10 KDa in crude cytosol that affect microsome-associated glucose-6-phosphatase activity.",

        "abstract": "Polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1), the principal enzyme responsible for reversible synthesis of polyphosphate (poly P) from the terminal phosphate of ATP, is highly conserved in bacteria and archaea. Dictyostelium discoideum, a social slime mold, is one of a few eukaryotes known to possess a PPK1 homolog (DdPPK1). Compared with PPK1 of Escherichia coli, DdPPK1 contains the conserved residues for ATP binding and autophosphorylation, but has an N-terminal extension of 370 aa, lacking homology with any known protein. Polyphosphate or ATP promote oligomerization of the enzyme in vitro. The DdPPK1 products are heterogeneous in chain length and shorter than those of E. coli. The unique DdPPK1 N-terminal domain was shown to be necessary for its enzymatic activity, cellular localization, and physiological functions. Mutants of DdPPK1, as previously reported, are defective in development, sporulation, and predation, and as shown here, in late stages of cytokinesis and cell division.",

        "abstract": "The Serum Response Factor (SRF) is an important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Dictyostelium discoideum srfB gene codes for an SRF homologue and is expressed in vegetative cells and during development under the control of three alternative promoters, which show different cell-type specific patterns of expression. The two more proximal promoters directed gene transcription in prestalk AB, stalk and lower-cup cells. The generation of a strain where the srfB gene has been interrupted (srfB(-)) has shown that this gene is required for regulation of actin-cytoskeleton-related functions, such as cytokinesis and macropinocytosis. The mutant failed to develop well in suspension, but could be rescued by cAMP pulsing, suggesting a defect in cAMP signaling. srfB(-) cells showed impaired chemotaxis to cAMP and defective lateral pseudopodium inhibition. Nevertheless, srfB(-) cells aggregated on agar plates and nitrocellulose filters 2 h earlier than wild type cells, and completed development, showing an increased tendency to form slug structures. Analysis of wild type and srfB(-) strains detected significant differences in the regulation of gene expression upon starvation. Genes coding for lysosomal and ribosomal proteins, developmentally-regulated genes, and some genes coding for proteins involved in cytoskeleton regulation were deregulated during the first stages of development.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondria are complex organelles that provide energy for the cell in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and have very specific structures. For most organisms, this is a reticular or tubular mitochondrial network, while others have singular oval-shaped organelles. Nonetheless, maintenance of this structure is dependent on the mitochondrial dynamics, fission, fusion, and motility. Recently, studies have shown that the cytoskeleton has a significant role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. In this review, we focus on microtubules and actin filaments and look at what is currently known about the cytoskeleton's role in mitochondrial dynamics in complex models like mammals and yeast, as well as what is known in the simple model system, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Understanding how the cytoskeleton is involved in mitochondrial dynamics increases our understanding of mitochondrial disease, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Increases in fission, loss of fusion, and fragmented mitochondria are seen in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. There is no known cure for these diseases, but new therapeutic strategies using drugs to alter mitochondrial fusion and fission activity are being considered. The future of these therapeutic studies is dependent on an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics. Understanding the cytoskeleton's role in dynamics in multiple model organisms will further our understanding of these mechanisms and could potentially uncover new therapeutic targets for these neurodegenerative diseases.",

Most of our understanding of chemotaxis comes from studies of cells undergoing amoeboid-type migration, in particular the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and leukocytes. In these amoeboid cells the molecular events leading to directed migration can be conceptually divided into four interacting networks: receptor/G protein, signal transduction, cytoskeleton, and polarity. The signal transduction network occupies a central position in this scheme as it receives direct input from the receptor/G protein network, as well as feedback from the cytoskeletal and polarity networks. Multiple overlapping modules within the signal transduction network transmit the signals to the actin cytoskeleton network leading to biased pseudopod protrusion in the direction of the gradient. The overall architecture of the networks, as well as the individual signaling modules, is remarkably conserved between Dictyostelium and mammalian leukocytes, and the similarities and differences between the two systems are the subject of this review.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic AMP acting on protein kinase A controls sporulation and encystation in social and solitary amoebas. In Dictyostelium discoideum, adenylate cyclase R (ACR), is essential for spore encapsulation. In addition to its cyclase (AC) domain, ACR harbors seven transmembrane helices, a histidine kinase domain, and two receiver domains. We investigated the role of these domains in the regulation of AC activity. Expression of an ACR-YFP fusion protein in acr(-) cells rescued their sporulation defective phenotype and revealed that ACR is associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of the transmembrane helices (\u0394TM) caused a 60% reduction of AC activity, but \u0394TM-ACR still rescued the acr(-) phenotype. The isolated AC domain was properly expressed but inactive. Mutation of three essential ATP-binding residues in the histidine kinase domain did not affect the AC activity or phenotypic rescue. Mutation of the essential phosphoryl-accepting aspartate in receivers 1, 2, or both had only modest effects on AC activity and did not affect phenotypic rescue, indicating that AC activity is not critically regulated by phosphorelay. Remarkably, the dimerizing histidine phosphoacceptor subdomain, which in ACR lacks the canonical histidine for autophosphorylation, was essential for AC activity. Transformation of wild-type cells with an ACR allele (\u0394CRA) that is truncated after this domain inhibited AC activity of endogenous ACR and replicated the acr(-) phenotype. Combined with the observation that the isolated AC domain was inactive, the dominant-negative effect of \u0394CRA strongly suggests that the defunct phosphoacceptor domain acquired a novel role in enforcing dimerization of the AC domain.",

Here, we shed light on natural products from eukaryotic microorganisms that have the ability to transition from single cells to multicellular organisms: the social amoebae. These eukaryotes harbor a large number of polyketide biosynthetic genes in their genomes, yet virtually none of the corresponding products can be isolated or characterized. Using complementary molecular biology approaches, including CRISPR-Cas9, we generated polyketide synthase (<i>pks5</i>) inactivation and overproduction strains of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Differential, untargeted metabolomics of wild-type versus mutant fruiting bodies allowed us to pinpoint candidate metabolites derived from the amoebal PKS5. Extrachromosomal expression of the respective gene led to the identification of a yellow polyunsaturated fatty acid. Analysis of the temporospatial production pattern of this compound in conjunction with detailed bioactivity studies revealed the polyketide to be a spore germination suppressor.",

        "abstract": "Although their amino acid sequences and structure closely resemble DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 proteins were recently shown by Goll and colleagues to function as RNA methyltransferases transferring a methyl group to the C5 position of C38 in tRNA(Asp). We observe that human DNMT2 methylates tRNA isolated from Dnmt2 knock-out Drosophila melanogaster and Dictyostelium discoideum. RNA extracted from wild type D. melanogaster was methylated to a lower degree, but in the case of Dictyostelium, there was no difference in the methylation of RNA isolated from wild-type and Dnmt2 knock-out strains. Methylation of in vitro transcribed tRNA(Asp) confirms it to be a target of DNMT2. Using site directed mutagenesis, we show here that the enzyme has a DNA methyltransferase-like mechanism, because similar residues from motifs IV, VI, and VIII are involved in catalysis as identified in DNA methyltransferases. In addition, exchange of C292, which is located in a CFT motif conserved among Dnmt2 proteins, strongly reduced the catalytic activity of DNMT2. Dnmt2 represents the first example of an RNA methyltransferase using a DNA methyltransferase type of mechanism.",

Northern blot analysis showed that mRNAs for racA, racE, racG, racH and racI were present at all stages of development, whereas racJ and racL were expressed only at late stages. Amino acid sequences have been analysed in the context of Rho-related proteins of other organisms. Rac1a/1b/1c, RacF1/F2 and to a lesser extent RacB and the GTPase domain of RacA can be grouped in the Rac subfamily. None of the additional Dictyostelium Rho-related proteins belongs to any of the well-defined subfamilies, like Rac, Cdc42 or Rho. RacD and RacA are unique in that they lack the prenylation motif characteristic of Rho proteins. RacD possesses a 50 residue C-terminal extension and RacA a 400 residue C-terminal extension that contains a proline-rich region, two BTB domains and a novel C-terminal domain.

Differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1) and DIF-3, which are chlorinated alkylphenones, are lead anticancer compounds found in the cellular slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Here, we examined the in vitro effects of DIF-1, DIF-3, and 25 DIF derivatives on cell proliferation and serum-induced cell migration in human MDA-MB-231 cells, a model TNBC cell line. We found that Br-DIF-1, a chlorine-to-bromine-substituted derivative of DIF-1, strongly suppressed cell migration (IC<sub>50</sub>, 3.8 \uf06dM) with negligible effects on cell proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, >20 \uf06dM). We then synthesized 18 derivatives of Br-DIF-1 and examined the in vitro effects of these derivatives on cell proliferation and serum-induced cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. Among the derivatives, Br-DIF-1(+1), Br-DIF-1(+2), and Br-DIF-3(+2) exhibited strong anti-cell migration activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.5, 1.0, and 3.1 \uf06dM, respectively, without affecting cell proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, >20 \uf06dM).

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has a vmp1-related gene that we identified previously in a functional genomic study. Loss-of-function of this gene leads to a severe phenotype that compromises Dictyostelium growth and development. The expression of mammalian Vmp1 in a vmp1(-) Dictyostelium mutant complemented the phenotype, suggesting a functional conservation of the protein among evolutionarily distant species and highlights Dictyostelium as a valid experimental system to address the function of this gene. Dictyostelium Vmp1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein necessary for the integrity of this organelle. Cells deficient in Vmp1 display pleiotropic defects in the secretory pathway and organelle biogenesis. The contractile vacuole, which is necessary to survive under hypoosmotic conditions, is not functional in the mutant. The structure of the Golgi apparatus, the function of the endocytic pathway and conventional protein secretion are also affected in these cells. Transmission electron microscopy of vmp1(-) cells showed the accumulation of autophagic features that suggests a role of Vmp1 in macroautophagy.

These quantitative studies revealed that rasC- cells translocate at the same velocity and exhibit chemotaxis up spatial gradients of cAMP with the same efficiency as control cells. However, rasC- cells exhibit defects in maintaining anterior-posterior polarity along the substratum and a single anterior pseudopod when translocating in buffer in the absence of an attractant. rasC- cells also exhibit defects in their responses to both the increasing and decreasing temporal gradients of cAMP in the front and the back of a wave. These defects result in the inability of rasC- cells to exhibit chemotaxis in a natural wave of cAMP. The inability to respond normally to temporal gradients of cAMP results in defects in the organization of the cytoskeleton, most notably in the failure of both F actin and myosin II to exit the cortex in response to the decreasing temporal gradient of cAMP in the back of the wave. While the behavioral defect in the front of the wave is similar to that of the myoA-/myoF- myosin I double mutant, the behavioral and cytoskeletal defects in the back of the wave are similar to those of the S13A myosin II regulatory light-chain phosphorylation mutant. Expression array data support the premise that the behavioral defects exhibited by the rasC- mutant are the immediate result of the absence of RasC function.",

Pulse-chase feeding with latex beads allowed purification of phagosomes at different stages of maturation. Gentle ATP stripping of an actin meshwork entrapping contaminating organelles resulted in a 10-fold increase in yield and purity, as confirmed by electron microscopy. Temporal profiling of signaling, cytoskeletal, and trafficking proteins resulted in a complex molecular fingerprint of phagosome biogenesis and maturation. First, nascent phagosomes were associated with coronin and rapidly received a lysosomal glycoprotein, LmpB. Second, at least two phases of delivery of lysosomal hydrolases (cathepsin D [CatD] and cysteine protease [CPp34]) were accompanied by removal of plasma membrane components (PM4C4 and biotinylated surface proteins). Third, a phase of late maturation, preparing for final exocytosis of undigested material, included quantitative recycling of hydrolases and association with vacuolin. Also, lysosomal glycoproteins of the Lmp family showed distinct trafficking kinetics. The delivery and recycling of CatD was directly visualized by confocal microscopy. This heavy membrane traffic of cargos was precisely accompanied by regulatory proteins such as the Rab7 GTPases and the endosomal SNAREs Vti1 and VAMP7. This initial molecular description of phagocytosis demonstrates the feasibility of a comprehensive analysis of phagosomal lipids and proteins in genetically modified strains.",

However, the mechanism by which spatial and temporal regulation of Rab GTPase activity is controlled is poorly understood. Here we describe a mechanism by which localized calcium release through a vesicular ion channel controls Rab GTPase activity. We show that activation of P2XA, an intracellular ion channel localized to the Dictyostelium discoideum contractile vacuole system, results in calcium efflux required for downregulation of Rab11a activity and efficient vacuole fusion. Vacuole fusion and Rab11a downregulation require the activity of CnrF, an EF-hand-containing Rab GAP found in a complex with Rab11a and P2XA. CnrF Rab GAP activity for Rab11a is enhanced by the presence of calcium and the EF-hand domain. These findings suggest that P2XA activation results in vacuolar calcium release, which triggers activation of CnrF Rab GAP activity and subsequent downregulation of Rab11a to allow vacuole fusion.",

RbdB is a nuclear protein that accumulates, together with Dicer B, in nucleolar foci reminiscent of plant dicing bodies. Disruption of rbdB results in loss of miRNAs and accumulation of primary miRNAs. The phenotype can be rescued by ectopic expression of RbdB thus allowing for a detailed analysis of domain function. The lack of cytoplasmic dsRBD proteins involved in miRNA processing, suggests that both processing steps take place in the nucleus thus resembling the plant pathway. However, we also find features e.g. in the domain structure of Dicer which suggest similarities to animals. Reduction of miRNAs in the rbdB- strain and their increase in the Argonaute A knock out allowed the definition of new miRNAs one of which appears to belong to a new non-canonical class.",

The transport pathways across the membrane are formed by ion channels that participate in metabolite exchange between mitochondria and cytoplasm (voltage-dependent anion-selective channel, VDAC) as well as in import of proteins encoded by nuclear genes (Tom40 and Sam50/Tob55). VDAC, Tom40, and Sam50/Tob55 are present in all eukaryotic organisms, encoded in the nuclear genome, and have \u03b2-barrel topology. We have compiled data sets of these protein sequences and studied their phylogenetic relationships with a special focus on the position of Amoebozoa. Additionally, we identified these protein-coding genes in Acanthamoeba castellanii and Dictyostelium discoideum to complement our data set and verify the phylogenetic position of these model organisms. Our analysis show that mitochondrial \u03b2-barrel channels from Archaeplastida (plants) and Opisthokonta (animals and fungi) experienced many duplication events that resulted in multiple paralogous isoforms and form well-defined monophyletic clades that match the current model of eukaryotic evolution. However, in representatives of Amoebozoa, Chromalveolata, and Excavata (former Protista), they do not form clearly distinguishable clades, although they locate basally to the plant and algae branches. In most cases, they do not posses paralogs and their sequences appear to have evolved quickly or degenerated. Consequently, the obtained phylogenies of mitochondrial outer membrane \u03b2-channels do not entirely reflect the recent eukaryotic classification system involving the six supergroups: Chromalveolata, Excavata, Archaeplastida, Rhizaria, Amoebozoa, and Opisthokonta.",

        "abstract": "A highly specific and sensitive mass assay for inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) was characterized. This centres around phosphorylating InsP6 with [32P]ATP using a recombinant InsP6 kinase from Giardia lambia, followed by HPLC of the 32P-labelled products with an internal [3H]InsP7 standard. This assay was used to quantify InsP6 levels in a variety of biological samples.Concentrations of InsP6 in rat tissues varied from 10-20 microM (assuming 64% of wet weight of tissue is cytosol water), whereas using the same assumption axenic Dictyostelium discoideum cells contained 352 +/- 11 microM InsP6. HeLa cells were seeded at low density and grown to confluence, at which point they contained InsP6 levels per mg of protein similar to rat tissues. This amounted to 1.952 +/- 0.117 nmol InsP6 per culture dish, despite the cells being grown in serum shown to contain no detectable(less than 20 pmol per dish) InsP6. These results demonstrate that mammalian cells synthesize all their own InsP6. Human blood was analysed, and although the white cell fraction contained InsP6 at a concentration comparable with other tissues, in serum and platelet-free plasma no InsP6 was detected (<1 nM InsP6). Human urine was also examined, and also contained no detectable (<5 nM) InsP6. These results suggest that dietary studies purporting to measure InsP6 at micromolar concentrations in human plasma or urine may not have been quantifying this inositol phosphate. Therefore claims that administrating InsP6 in the diet or applying it topically can produce health benefits by increasing extracellular InsP6 levels may require reassessment.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that left-right asymmetry originates in the cellular chirality. However, cell chirality has not yet been quantitatively investigated, mainly due to the absence of appropriate methods. Here we combine 3D Riesz transform-differential interference contrast (RT-DIC) microscopy and computational kinematic analysis to characterize chiral cellular morphology and motility. We reveal that filopodia of neuronal growth cones exhibit 3D left-helical motion with retraction and right-screw rotation. We next apply the methods to amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and discover right-handed clockwise cell migration on a 2D substrate and right-screw rotation of subcellular protrusions along the radial axis in a 3D substrate. Thus, RT-DIC microscopy and the computational kinematic analysis are useful and versatile tools to reveal the mechanisms of left-right asymmetry formation and the emergence of lateralized functions.",

GbpC belongs to the Roco family of proteins that often share a central core region, consisting of leucine-rich repeats, a Ras domain (Roc), a Cor domain, and a MAPKKKinase domain. In addition to this core, GbpC contains a RasGEF domain and two cGMP-binding domains. Here, we report on an intramolecular signaling cascade of GbpC. In vitro, the RasGEF domain of GbpC specifically accelerates the GDP/GTP exchange of the Roc domain. Moreover, cGMP binding to GbpC strongly stimulates the binding of GbpC to GTP-agarose, suggesting cGMP-stimulated GDP/GTP exchange at the Roc domain. The function of the protein in vivo was investigated by rescue analysis of the chemotactic defect of gbpC null cells. Mutants that lack a functional guanine exchange factor (GEF), Roc, or kinase domain are inactive in vivo. Together, the results suggest a four-step intramolecular activation mechanism of the Roco protein GbpC: cGMP binding to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domains, activation of the GEF domain, GDP/GTP exchange of Roc, and activation of the MAPKKK domain.",

A 14 nucleotide region of the cotC promoter binds CudA in vitro and ECudA, an Entamoeba CudA homologue, also binds to this site. The CudA and ECudA DNA-binding sites contain a dyad and, consistent with a symmetrical binding site, CudA forms a homodimer in the yeast two-hybrid system. Mutation of CudA binding sites within the cotC promoter reduces expression from cotC in prespore cells. The CudA and ECudA proteins share a 120 amino acid core of homology, and clustered point mutations introduced into two highly conserved motifs within the ECudA core region decrease its specific DNA binding in vitro. This region, the presumptive DNA-binding domain, is similar in sequence to domains in two Arabidopsis proteins and one Oryza protein. Significantly, these are the only proteins in the two plant species that contain an SH2 domain. Such a structure, with a DNA-binding domain located upstream of an SH2 domain, suggests that the plant proteins are orthologous to metazoan STATs. Consistent with this notion, the DNA sequence of the CudA half site, GAA, is identical to metazoan STAT half sites, although the relative positions of the two halves of the dyad are reversed. These results define a hitherto unrecognised class of transcription factors and suggest a model for the evolution of STATs and their DNA-binding sites.",

In gene-dense genomes, transposable elements are notably under selection to avoid insertional mutagenesis of host protein-coding genes. We describe an example of convergent evolution in the distantly related amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the D. discoideum retrotransposon DGLT-A and the yeast Ty3 element developed different mechanisms to facilitate position-specific integration at similar sites upstream of tRNA genes. Transcription of tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III requires the transcription factor complexes TFIIIB and TFIIIC. Whereas Ty3 recognizes tRNA genes mainly through interactions of its integrase with TFIIIB subunits, the DGLT-A-encoded ribonuclease H contacts TFIIIC subunit Tfc4 at an interface that covers tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) 7 and 8. A major function of this interface is to connect TFIIIC subcomplexes \u03c4A and \u03c4B and to facilitate TFIIIB assembly. During the initiation of tRNA gene transcription \u03c4B is displaced from \u03c4A, which transiently exposes the TPR 7/8 surface of Tfc4 on \u03c4A. We propose that the DGLT-A intasome uses this binding site to obtain access to genomic DNA for integration during tRNA gene transcription.",

Ongoing curation of the genome to date has revealed 40 genes in D. discoideum with clear evidence of alternative splicing, supporting the existence of alternative splicing in this unicellular organism. We identified 160 candidate U2-type spliceosomal proteins and related factors in D. discoideum based on 264 known human genes involved in splicing. Spliceosomal small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), PRP19 complex proteins and late-acting proteins are highly conserved in D. discoideum and throughout the metazoa. In non-snRNP and hnRNP families, D. discoideum orthologs are closer to those in A. thaliana, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens than to their counterparts in S. cerevisiae. Several splicing regulators, including SR proteins and CUG-binding proteins, were found in D. discoideum, but not in yeast.

A Saccharomyces kluyveri pyd3 mutant that is unable to grow on N-carbamyl-beta-alanine as the sole nitrogen source and exhibits diminished beta-alanine synthase activity was used to clone analogous genes from different eukaryotes. Putative PYD3 sequences from the yeast S. kluyveri, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster complemented the pyd3 defect. When the S. kluyveri PYD3 gene was expressed in S. cerevisiae, which has no pyrimidine catabolic pathway, it enabled growth on N-carbamyl-beta-alanine as the sole nitrogen source. The D. discoideum and D. melanogaster PYD3 gene products are similar to mammalian beta-alanine synthases. In contrast, the S. kluyveri protein is quite different from these and more similar to bacterial N-carbamyl amidohydrolases. All three beta-alanine synthases are to some degree related to various aspartate transcarbamylases, which catalyze the second step of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. PYD3 expression in yeast seems to be inducible by dihydrouracil and N-carbamyl-beta-alanine, but not by uracil.

We show that, in Dictyostelium discoideum, activated forms of RasC prolong the time course of TORC2 (target of rapamycin [Tor] complex 2)-mediated activation of a myristoylated protein kinase B (PKB; PKBR1) and the phosphorylation of PKB substrates, independently of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Paralleling these changes, the kinetics of chemoattractant-induced adenylyl cyclase activation and actin polymerization are extended, pseudopodial activity is increased and mislocalized, and chemotaxis is impaired. The effects of activated RasC are suppressed by deletion of the TORC2 subunit PiaA. In vitro RasC(Q62L)-dependent PKB phosphorylation can be rapidly initiated by the addition of a PiaA-associated immunocomplex to membranes of TORC2-deficient cells and blocked by TOR-specific inhibitor PP242. Furthermore, TORC2 binds specifically to the activated form of RasC. These results demonstrate that RasC is an upstream regulator of TORC2 and that the TORC2-PKB signaling mediates effects of activated Ras proteins on the cytoskeleton and cell migration.",

It plays crucial roles in cell signalling, cell-cycle control and in maintaining proteome integrity and protein homeostasis. In plants, Hsp90s are required for normal plant growth and development. Hsp90s are observed to be upregulated in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses and are also involved in immune responses in plants. Although there are several studies elucidating the physiological role of Hsp90s in plants, their molecular mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, biochemical characterization of an Hsp90 protein from rice (Oryza sativa; OsHsp90) has been performed and the crystal structure of its N-terminal domain (OsHsp90-NTD) was determined. The binding of OsHsp90 to its substrate ATP and the inhibitor 17-AAG was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The protein also exhibited a weak ATPase activity. The crystal structure of OsHsp90-NTD was solved in complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP at 3.1 \u00c5 resolution. The domain was crystallized by cross-seeding with crystals of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 from Dictyostelium discoideum, which shares 70% sequence identity with OsHsp90-NTD. This is the second reported structure of a domain of Hsp90 from a plant source.",

        "abstract": "Airway hydration and ciliary function are critical to airway homeostasis and dysregulated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is impacted by cigarette smoking and has no therapeutic options. We utilized a high-copy cDNA library genetic selection approach in the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> to identify genetic protectors to cigarette smoke. Members of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP transporter family adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) are protective against cigarette smoke in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and human bronchial epithelial cells. Gene expression of ANT2 is reduced in lung tissue from COPD patients and in a mouse smoking model, and overexpression of ANT1 and ANT2 resulted in enhanced oxidative respiration and ATP flux. In addition to the presence of ANT proteins in the mitochondria, they reside at the plasma membrane in airway epithelial cells and regulate airway homeostasis. ANT2 overexpression stimulates airway surface hydration by ATP and maintains ciliary beating after exposure to cigarette smoke, both of which are key functions of the airway. Our study highlights a potential for upregulation of ANT proteins and/or of their agonists in the protection from dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism, airway hydration and ciliary motility in COPD.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

Coronin7 proteins are characterized by two WD-repeat domains that presumably fold into two beta-propeller structures. DdCRN7 shares highest homology with human CRN7, a protein with roles in membrane trafficking. DdCRN7 is present in the cytosol and accumulates in cell surface projections during movement and phago- and pinocytosis. Cells lacking CRN7 have altered chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Furthermore, loss of CRN7 affects the infection process by the pathogen Legionella pneumophila and allows a more efficient internalization of bacteria. To provide a mechanism for CNR7 action, we studied actin-related aspects. We could show that CRN7 binds directly to F-actin and protects actin filaments from depolymerization. CRN7 also associated with F-actin in vivo. It was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton, colocalized with F-actin, and its distribution was sensitive to drugs affecting the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that the CRN7 role in chemotaxis and phagocytosis is through its effect on the actin cytoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is an environmental bacterium, which replicates in amoeba but also in macrophages, and causes a life-threatening pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. The opportunistic pathogen employs the \u03b1-hydroxy-ketone compound Legionella autoinducer-1 (LAI-1) for intraspecies and interkingdom signaling. LAI-1 is produced by the autoinducer synthase Legionella quorum sensing A (LqsA), but it is not known, how LAI-1 is released by the pathogen. Here, we use a Vibrio cholerae luminescence reporter strain and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect bacteria-produced and synthetic LAI-1. Ectopic production of LqsA in Escherichia coli generated LAI-1, which partitions to outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and increases OMV size. These E.\u00a0coli OMVs trigger luminescence of the V.\u00a0cholerae reporter strain and inhibit the migration of Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba. Overexpression of lqsA in L.pneumophila under the control of strong stationary phase promoters (P<sub>flaA</sub> or P<sub>6SRNA</sub>), but not under control of its endogenous promoter (P<sub>lqsA</sub>), produces LAI-1, which is detected in purified OMVs. These L. pneumophila OMVs trigger luminescence of the Vibrio reporter strain and inhibit D.\u00a0discoideum migration. L.\u00a0pneumophila OMVs are smaller upon overexpression of lqsA or upon addition of LAI-1 to growing bacteria, and therefore, LqsA affects OMV production. The overexpression of lqsA but not a catalytically inactive mutant promotes intracellular replication of L.\u00a0pneumophila in macrophages, indicating that intracellularly produced LA1-1 modulates the interaction in favor of the pathogen. Taken together, we provide evidence that L.\u00a0pneumophila LAI-1 is secreted through OMVs and promotes interbacterial communication and interactions with eukaryotic host cells.",

Several of the most abundant small complex repeats and transposons (DIRS-1; TRE3-A,B; TRE5-A; skipper; Tdd-4; H3R) have been described previously. In our analysis we have identified additional elements. Thus, we can now present a complete list of complex repetitive elements in D. discoideum. All elements add up to 10% of the genome. Some of the newly described elements belong to established classes (TRE3-C, D; TRE5-B,C; DGLT-A,P; Tdd-5). However, we have also defined two new classes of DNA transposable elements (DDT and thug) that have not been described thus far. Based on the nucleotide amount, we calculated the least copy number in each family. These vary between <10 up to >200 copies. Unique sequences adjacent to the element ends and truncation points in elements gave a measure for the fragmentation of the elements. Furthermore, we describe the diversity of single elements with regard to polymorphisms and conserved structures. All elements show insertion preference into loci in which other elements of the same family reside. The analysis of the complex repeats is a valuable data resource for the ongoing assembly of whole D. discoideum chromosomes.",

A key subset of LS mutants abolishes OCRL's interactions with endocytic adaptors containing F&H peptide motifs. Converging unbiased methods examining human peptides and the unicellular phagocytic organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> reveal that, like OCRL, the <i>Dictyostelium</i> OCRL orthologue Dd5P4 binds two proteins closely related to the F&H proteins APPL1 and Ses1/2 (also referred to as IPIP27A/B). In addition, a novel conserved F&H interactor was identified, GxcU (in <i>Dictyostelium)</i> and the Cdc42-GEF FGD1-related F-actin binding protein (Frabin) (in human cells). Examining these proteins in <i>D. discoideum</i>, we find that, like OCRL, Dd5P4 acts at well-conserved and physically distinct endocytic stations. Dd5P4 functions in coordination with F&H proteins to control membrane deformation at multiple stages of endocytosis and suppresses GxcU-mediated activity during fluid-phase micropinocytosis. We also reveal that OCRL/Dd5P4 acts at the contractile vacuole, an exocytic osmoregulatory organelle. We propose F&H peptide-containing proteins may be key modifiers of LS phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Upon starvation, individual Dictyostelium discoideum cells enter a developmental program that leads to collective migration and the formation of a multicellular organism. The process is mediated by extracellular cAMP binding to the G protein-coupled cAMP receptor 1, which initiates a signaling cascade leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase A (ACA), the synthesis and secretion of additional cAMP, and an autocrine and paracrine activation loop. The release of cAMP allows neighboring cells to polarize and migrate directionally and form characteristic chains of cells called streams. We now report that cAMP relay can be measured biochemically by assessing ACA, ERK2, and TORC2 activities at successive time points in development after stimulating cells with subsaturating concentrations of cAMP. We also find that the activation profiles of ACA, ERK2, and TORC2 change in the course of development, with later developed cells showing a loss of sensitivity to the relayed signal. We examined mutants in PKA activity that have been associated with precocious development and find that this loss in responsiveness occurs earlier in these mutants. Remarkably, we show that this loss in sensitivity correlates with a switch in migration patterns as cells transition from streams to aggregates. We propose that as cells proceed through development, the cAMP-induced desensitization and down-regulation of cAMP receptor 1 impacts the sensitivities of chemotactic signaling cascades leading to changes in migration patterns.",

In this paper, we exploit Dictyostelium discoideum to uncover a novel role for PARylation in regulating nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). PARylation occurred at single-strand breaks, and two PARPs, Adprt1b and Adprt2, were required for resistance to this kind of DNA damage. In contrast, although Adprt1b was dispensable for PARylation at DSBs, Adprt1a and, to a lesser extent, Adprt2 were required for this event. Disruption of adprt2 had a subtle impact on the ability of cells to perform NHEJ. However, disruption of adprt1a decreased the ability of cells to perform end joining with a concomitant increase in homologous recombination. PAR-dependent regulation of NHEJ was achieved through promoting recruitment and/or retention of Ku at DSBs. Furthermore, a PAR interaction motif in Ku70 was required for this regulation and efficient NHEJ. These data illustrate that PARylation at DSBs promotes NHEJ through recruitment or retention of repair factors at sites of DNA damage.",

Ras proteins are major regulators of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium; they are activated at the leading edge, are required for chemoattractant-mediated activation of PI3K and TORC2, and are one of the most rapid responders, with activity peaking at approximately 3 s after stimulation. We demonstrate that in myosin II (MyoII) null cells, Ras activation is highly extended and is not restricted to the site closest to the chemoattractant source. This causes elevated, extended, and spatially misregulated activation of PI3K and TORC2 and their effectors Akt/PKB and PKBR1, as well as elevated F-actin polymerization. We further demonstrate that disruption of specific IQGAP/cortexillin complexes, which also regulate cortical mechanics, causes extended activation of PI3K and Akt/PKB but not Ras activation. Our findings suggest that MyoII and IQGAP/cortexillin play key roles in spatially and temporally regulating leading-edge activity and, through this, the ability of cells to restrict the site of pseudopod formation.",

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that the eukaryotic C-type natriuretic peptide hormone (CNP) regulates Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and biofilm formation after binding on the AmiC sensor, triggering the amiE transcription. Herein, the involvement of the aliphatic amidase AmiE in P. aeruginosa virulence regulation has been investigated. The proteome analysis of an AmiE over-producing strain (AmiE<sup>+</sup>) revealed an expression change for 138 proteins, including some that are involved in motility, synthesis of quorum sensing compounds and virulence regulation. We observed that the AmiE<sup>+</sup> strain produced less biofilm compared to the wild type, and over-produced rhamnolipids. In the same line, AmiE is involved in P. aeruginosa motilities (swarming and twitching) and production of the quorum sensing molecules N-acyl homoserine lactones and Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS). We observed that AmiE overproduction reduced levels of HCN and pyocyanin causing a decreased virulence in different hosts (i.e. Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans). This phenotype was further confirmed in a mouse model of acute lung infection, in which AmiE overproduction resulted in an almost fully virulence decrease. Taken together, our data suggest that, in addition to its role in bacterial secondary metabolism, AmiE is involved in P. aeruginosa virulence regulation by modulating pilus synthesis and cell-to-cell communication.",

        "title": "A conserved pressure-driven mechanism for regulating cytosolic osmolarity.",
        "abstract": "Controlling intracellular osmolarity is essential to all cellular life. Cells that live in hypo-osmotic environments, such as freshwater, must constantly battle water influx to avoid swelling until they burst. Many eukaryotic cells use contractile vacuoles to collect excess water from the cytosol and pump it out of the cell. Although contractile vacuoles are essential to many species, including important pathogens, the mechanisms that control their dynamics remain unclear. To identify the basic principles governing contractile vacuole function, we investigate here the molecular mechanisms of two species with distinct vacuolar morphologies from different eukaryotic lineages: the discoban Naegleria gruberi and the amoebozoan slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Using quantitative cell biology, we find that although these species respond differently to osmotic challenges, they both use vacuolar-type proton pumps for filling contractile vacuoles and actin for osmoregulation, but not to power water expulsion. We also use analytical modeling to show that cytoplasmic pressure is sufficient to drive water out of contractile vacuoles in these species, similar to findings from the alveolate Paramecium multimicronucleatum. These analyses show that cytoplasmic pressure is sufficient to drive contractile vacuole emptying for a wide range of cellular pressures and vacuolar geometries. Because vacuolar-type proton-pump-dependent contractile vacuole filling and pressure-dependent emptying have now been validated in three eukaryotic lineages that diverged well over a billion years ago, we propose that this represents an ancient eukaryotic mechanism of osmoregulation.",

The mature form of dynamin B mediates a wide range and unique combination of functions. Dynamin B affects events at the plasma membrane, peroxisomes, the contractile vacuole system, components of the actin-based cytoskeleton, and cell adhesion sites. The modulating effect of dynamin B on the activity of the contractile vacuole system is unique for the Dictyostelium system. Other functions displayed by dynamin B are commonly associated with either classical dynamins or dynamin-related proteins.",

The core component hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) can be used as both its structural protein and secretory protein or chaperone protein. Studies on Hcp are important to elucidate the overall virulence mechanism of T6SS. <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> is an important foodborne pathogen. There are three copies of <i>hcp</i> genes identified in <i>S</i>. Typhimurium 14028s. This study aimed to characterize the functions of the three Hcp family proteins and to elucidate the interactions among them. The <i>hcp</i> gene deletion mutants were constructed by \u03bb Red-based recombination system. Effects of <i>hcp</i> mutation on the pathogenicity of 14028s were studied by bacterial competition assays, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> assays and mouse model. The three Hcp family proteins were found to play different roles. Hcp1 can affect the transcription of <i>rpoS</i> and type 2 flagellar gene and influence the motility of 14028s. It is also involved in the intracellular survival of 14028s in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>; Hcp2 is involved in the early proliferative capacity of 14028s in mice and can prevent its excessive proliferation; Hcp3 did not show direct functions in these assays. Hcp1 can interact with Hcp2 and Hcp3. Deletion of one <i>hcp</i> gene can result in a transcription level variation in the other two <i>hcp</i> genes. Our findings elucidated the functions of the three Hcp family proteins in <i>S</i>.Typhimurium and illustrated that there are interactions between different Hcp proteins.

        "abstract": "In this study, an ertapenem-nonsusceptible <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolate was investigated to determine the genetic basis for its carbapenem resistance phenotype. This clinical strain was recovered from a patient that received, 1 year previously, ertapenem to treat a cholangitis due to a carbapenem-susceptible extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing <i>E. coli</i> isolate. Whole-genome sequencing of these strains was performed using Illumina and single-molecule real-time sequencing technologies. It revealed that they belonged to the ST131 clonal group, had the predicted O25b:H4 serotype, and produced the CTX-M-15 and TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamases. One nucleotide substitution was identified between these strains. It affected the <i>ompR</i> gene, which codes for a regulatory protein involved in the control of OmpC/OmpF porin expression, creating a Gly-63-Val substitution. The role of OmpR alteration was confirmed by a complementation experiment that fully restored the susceptibility to ertapenem of the clinical isolate. A modeling study showed that the Gly-63-Val change displaced the histidine-kinase phosphorylation site. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the ertapenem-nonsusceptible <i>E. coli</i> strain had a decreased expression of OmpC/OmpF porins. No significant defect in the growth rate or in the resistance to <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> amoeba phagocytosis was found in the ertapenem-nonsusceptible <i>E. coli</i> isolate compared to its susceptible parental strain. Our report demonstrates for the first time that ertapenem resistance may emerge clinically from ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> due to mutations that modulate the OmpR activity.",

        "abstract": "Changes in free intracellular Ca2+ are thought to regulate several major processes during Dictyostelium development, including cell aggregation and cell type-specific gene expression, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. To learn more about Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ homeostasis in this organism, we used suppression subtractive hybridization to identify genes up-regulated by high extracellular Ca2+. Unexpectedly, many of the genes identified belong to a novel gene family (termed cup) with seven members. In vegetative cells, the cup genes were up-regulated by high Ca2+ but not by other ions or by heat, oxidative, or osmotic stress. cup induction by Ca2+ was blocked completely by inhibitors of calcineurin and protein synthesis. In developing cells, cup expression was high during aggregation and late development but low during the slug stage. This pattern correlates closely with reported levels of free intracellular Ca2+ during development. The cup gene products are highly homologous, acidic proteins possessing putative ricin domains. BLAST searches failed to reveal homologs in other organisms, but Western analyses suggested that Cup-like proteins might exist in certain other cellular slime mold species. Localization experiments indicated that Cup proteins are primarily cytoplasmic but become cell membrane-associated during Ca2+ stress and cell aggregation. When cup expression was down-regulated by antisense RNA, the cells failed to aggregate. However, this developmental block was overcome by partially up-regulating cup expression. Together, these results suggest that the Cup proteins in Dictyostelium might play an important role in stabilizing and/or regulating the cell membrane during Ca2+ stress and/or certain stages of development.",

To investigate its in vivo functions we have generated knockout mutants by gene replacement. Based on comitin's in vitro functions we examined properties related to vesicular transport and microfilament function. Whereas cell growth, pinocytosis, secretion, chemotaxis, motility, and development were unaltered, comitin-lacking cells were impaired in the early steps of phagocytosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae particles and of Escherichia coli, whereas uptake of latex beads was unaffected. Furthermore, the lack of comitin positively affected survival of pathogenic bacteria. Mutant cells also showed an altered response to hyperosmotic shock in comparison to the wild type. The redistribution of comitin during hyperosmotic shock in wild-type cells and its presence on early phagosomes suggest a direct involvement of comitin in these processes.",

However, remarkably little is known about the origin of heterogeneity or whether intrinsic and extrinsic variation can be controlled to generate reproducible cell type proportioning seen in\u00a0vivo. Here, we use experimentation and modeling in D.\u00a0discoideum to demonstrate that population-level cell cycle heterogeneity can be optimized to generate robust cell fate proportioning. First, cell cycle position is quantitatively linked to responsiveness to differentiation-inducing signals. Second, intrinsic variation in cell cycle length ensures cells are randomly distributed throughout the cell cycle at the onset of multicellular development. Finally, extrinsic perturbation of optimal cell cycle heterogeneity is buffered by compensatory changes in global signal responsiveness. These studies thus illustrate key regulatory principles underlying cell-cell heterogeneity optimization and the generation of robust and reproducible fate choice in development.",

        "abstract": "Cell migration is initiated by plasma membrane protrusions, in the form of lamellipodia and filopodia. The latter rod-like projections may exert sensory functions and are found in organisms as distant in evolution as mammals and amoeba such as Dictyostelium discoideum. In mammals, lamellipodia protrusion downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 requires a multimeric protein assembly, the WAVE-complex, which activates Arp2/3-mediated actin filament nucleation and actin network assembly. A current model of filopodia formation postulates that these structures arise from a dendritic network of lamellipodial actin filaments by selective elongation and bundling. Here, we have analyzed filopodia formation in mammalian cells abrogated in expression of essential components of the lamellipodial actin polymerization machinery. Cells depleted of the WAVE-complex component Nck-associated protein 1 (Nap1), and, in consequence, of lamellipodia, exhibited normal filopodia protrusion. Likewise, the Arp2/3-complex, which is essential for lamellipodia protrusion, is dispensable for filopodia formation. Moreover, genetic disruption of nap1 or the WAVE-orthologue suppressor of cAMP receptor (scar) in Dictyostelium was also ineffective in preventing filopodia protrusion. These data suggest that the molecular mechanism of filopodia formation is conserved throughout evolution from Dictyostelium to mammals and show that lamellipodia and filopodia formation are functionally separable.",

This lipid asymmetry is one of the earliest readouts of polarity in neutrophils, Dictyostelium discoideum and fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms that regulate PtdInsP(3) polarization are not well understood. Using a cationic lipid shuttling system, we have delivered exogenous PtdInsP(3) to neutrophils. Exogenous PtdInsP(3) elicits accumulation of endogenous PtdInsP(3) in a positive feedback loop that requires endogenous phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases (PI(3)Ks) and Rho family GTPases. This feedback loop is important for establishing PtdInsP(3) polarity in response to both chemoattractant and to exogenous PtdInsP(3); it may function through a self-organizing pattern formation system. Emergent properties of positive and negative regulatory links between PtdInsP(3) and Rho family GTPases may constitute a broadly conserved module for the establishment of cell polarity during eukaryotic chemotaxis.",

Consequently, the space available for selfish mobile elements to expand without excess damage to the host genome is limited. The non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon TRE5-A maintains an active population in the D. discoideum genome and apparently adapted to this gene-dense environment by targeting positions ~47 bp upstream of tRNA genes that are devoid of protein-coding regions. Because only ~24% of tRNA genes are associated with a TRE5-A element in the reference genome, we evaluated whether TRE5-A retrotransposition is limited to this subset of tRNA genes. We determined that a tagged TRE5-A element (TRE5-Absr) integrated at 384 of 405 tRNA genes, suggesting that expansion of the current natural TRE5-A population is not limited by the availability of targets. We further observed that TRE5-Absr targets the ribosomal 5S gene on the multicopy extrachromosomal DNA element that carries the ribosomal RNA genes, indicating that TRE5-A integration may extend to the entire RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcriptome. We determined that both natural TRE5-A and cloned TRE5-Absr retrotranspose to locations on the extrachromosomal rDNA element that contain tRNA gene-typical A/B box promoter motifs without displaying any other tRNA gene context. Based on previous data suggesting that TRE5-A targets tRNA genes by locating Pol III transcription complexes, we propose that A/B box loci reflect Pol III transcription complex assembly sites that possess a function in the biology of the extrachromosomal rDNA element.",

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the actions of DIF-3 remain to be elucidated. In this study, we synthesized a green fluorescent derivative of DIF-3, BODIPY-DIF-3, and a control fluorescent compound, Bu-BODIPY (butyl-BODIPY), and investigated how DIF-like molecules behave in human cervical cancer HeLa cells by using both fluorescence and electron microscopy. BODIPY-DIF-3 at 5-20 \u00b5 M suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Bu-BODIPY had minimal effect on cell growth. When cells were incubated with BODIPY-DIF-3 at 20 \u00b5M, it penetrated cell membranes within 0.5 h and localized mainly in mitochondria, while Bu-BODIPY did not stain the cells. Exposure of cells for 1-3 days to DIF-3, Bu-DIF-3, BODIPY-DIF-3, or CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) induced substantial mitochondrial swelling, suppressing cell growth. When added to isolated mitochondria, DIF-3, Bu-DIF-3, and BOIDPY-DIF-3, like CCCP, dose-dependently promoted the rate of oxygen consumption, but Bu-BODIPY did not. Our results suggest that these bioactive DIF-like molecules suppress cell growth, at least in part, by disturbing mitochondrial activity.

To gain insight into the factors underlying different PHD substrates and properties, we carried out biochemical and biophysical studies on PHD homologues from the cellular slime mold, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum,</i> and the protozoan parasite, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, both lacking HIF. The respective prolyl-hydroxylases (DdPhyA and TgPhyA) catalyze prolyl-hydroxylation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1), a reaction enabling adaptation to different dioxygen availability. Assays with full-length Skp1 substrates reveal substantial differences in the kinetic properties of DdPhyA and TgPhyA, both with respect to each other and compared with human PHD2; consistent with cellular studies, TgPhyA is more active at low dioxygen concentrations than DdPhyA. TgSkp1 is a DdPhyA substrate and DdSkp1 is a TgPhyA substrate. No cross-reactivity was detected between DdPhyA/TgPhyA substrates and human PHD2. The human Skp1 E147P variant is a DdPhyA and TgPhyA substrate, suggesting some retention of ancestral interactions. Crystallographic analysis of DdPhyA enables comparisons with homologues from humans, <i>Trichoplax adhaerens</i>, and prokaryotes, informing on differences in mobile elements involved in substrate binding and catalysis. In DdPhyA, two mobile loops that enclose substrates in the PHDs are conserved, but the C-terminal helix of the PHDs is strikingly absent. The combined results support the proposal that PHD homologues have evolved kinetic and structural features suited to their specific sensing roles.",

        "abstract": "Detection of substances tasting bitter to humans occurs in diverse organisms including the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. To establish a molecular mechanism for bitter tastant detection in Dictyostelium, we screened a mutant library for resistance to a commonly used bitter standard, phenylthiourea. This approach identified a G-protein-coupled receptor mutant, grlJ(-), which showed a significantly increased tolerance to phenylthiourea in growth, survival and movement. This mutant was not resistant to a structurally dissimilar potent bitter tastant, denatonium benzoate, suggesting it is not a target for at least one other bitter tastant. Analysis of the cell-signalling pathway involved in the detection of phenylthiourea showed dependence upon heterotrimeric G protein and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, suggesting that this signalling pathway is responsible for the cellular effects of phenylthiourea. This is further supported by a phenylthiourea-dependent block in the transient cAMP-induced production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) in wild-type but not grlJ(-) cells. Finally, we have identified an uncharacterized human protein \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type B receptor subunit 1 isoform with weak homology to GrlJ that restored grlJ(-) sensitivity to phenylthiourea in cell movement and PIP3 regulation. Our results thus identify a novel pathway for the detection of the standard bitter tastant phenylthiourea in Dictyostelium and implicate a poorly characterized human protein in phenylthiourea-dependent cell responses.",

        "abstract": "Opportunistic infections by environmental fungi are a growing clinical problem, driven by an increasing population of people with immunocompromising conditions. Spores of the Mucorales order are ubiquitous in the environment but can also cause acute invasive infections in humans through germination and evasion of the mammalian host immune system. How they achieve this and the evolutionary drivers underlying the acquisition of virulence mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that a clinical isolate of Rhizopus microsporus contains a Ralstonia pickettii bacterial endosymbiont required for virulence in both zebrafish and mice and that this endosymbiosis enables the secretion of factors that potently suppress growth of the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, as well as their ability to engulf and kill other microbes. As amoebas are natural environmental predators of both bacteria and fungi, we propose that this tri-kingdom interaction contributes to establishing endosymbiosis and the acquisition of anti-phagocyte activity. Importantly, we show that this activity also protects fungal spores from phagocytosis and clearance by human macrophages, and endosymbiont removal renders the fungal spores avirulent in\u00a0vivo. Together, these findings describe a new role for a bacterial endosymbiont in Rhizopus microsporus pathogenesis in animals and suggest a mechanism of virulence acquisition through environmental interactions with amoebas.",

        "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, evades phago-lysosome fusion in mammalian and protozoan hosts to create a suitable niche for intracellular replication. To modulate vesicle trafficking pathways, L. pneumophila translocates effector proteins into eukaryotic cells through a Type IVB macro-molecular transport system called the Icm-Dot system. In this study, we employed a fluorescence-based translocation assay to show that 33 previously identified Legionella eukaryotic-like genes (leg) encode substrates of the Icm-Dot secretion system. To assess which of these proteins may contribute to the disruption of vesicle trafficking, we expressed each gene in yeast and looked for phenotypes related to vacuolar protein sorting. We found that LegC3-GFP and LegC7/YlfA-GFP caused the mis-secretion of CPY-Invertase, a fusion protein normally restricted to the yeast vacuole. We also found that LegC7/YlfA-GFP and its paralog LegC2/YlfB-GFP formed large structures around the yeast vacuole while LegC3-GFP localized to the plasma membrane and a fragmented vacuole. In mammalian cells, LegC2/YlfB-GFP and LegC7/YlfA-GFP were found within large structures that co-localized with anti-KDEL antibodies but excluded the lysosomal marker LAMP-1, similar to what is observed in Legionella-containing vacuoles. LegC3-GFP, in contrast, was observed as smaller structures which had no obvious co-localization with KDEL or LAMP-1. Finally, LegC3-GFP caused the accumulation of many endosome-like structures containing undigested material when expressed in the protozoan host Dictyostelium discoideum. Our results demonstrate that multiple Leg proteins are Icm/Dot-dependent substrates and that LegC3, LegC7/YlfA, and LegC2/YlfB may contribute to the intracellular trafficking of L. pneumophila by interfering with highly conserved pathways that modulate vesicle maturation.",

        "title": "Sphingosine kinase regulates the sensitivity of Dictyostelium discoideum cells to the anticancer drug cisplatin.",
        "abstract": "The drug cisplatin is widely used to treat a number of tumor types. However, resistance to the drug, which remains poorly understood, limits its usefulness. Previous work using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model for studying drug resistance showed that mutants lacking sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) lyase, the enzyme that degrades S-1-P, had increased resistance to cisplatin, whereas mutants overexpressing the enzyme were more sensitive to the drug. S-1-P is synthesized from sphingosine and ATP by the enzyme sphingosine kinase. We have identified two sphingosine kinase genes in D. discoideum--sgkA and sgkB--that are homologous to those of other species. The biochemical properties of the SgkA and SgkB enzymes suggest that they are the equivalent of the human Sphk1 and Sphk2 enzymes, respectively. Disruption of the kinases by homologous recombination (both single and double mutants) or overexpression of the sgkA gene resulted in altered growth rates and altered response to cisplatin. The null mutants showed increased sensitivity to cisplatin, whereas mutants overexpressing the sphingosine kinase resulted in increased resistance compared to the parental cells. The results indicate that both the SgkA and the SgkB enzymes function in regulating cisplatin sensitivity. The increase in sensitivity of the sphingosine kinase-null mutants was reversed by the addition of S-1-P, and the increased resistance of the sphingosine kinase overexpressor mutant was reversed by the inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine. Parallel changes in sensitivity of the null mutants are seen with the platinum-based drug carboplatin but not with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and etoposide. This pattern of specificity is similar to that observed with the S-1-P lyase mutants and should be useful in designing therapeutic schemes involving more than one drug. This study identifies the sphingosine kinases as new drug targets for modulating the sensitivity to platinum-based drugs.",

They do not detach with their rear part, while on the nonadhesive area they protrude pseudopods at their front toward the source of chemoattractant.

Cells lacking tsuA function could not effectively perform chemotaxis and were unable to become polarized or correctly orient pseudopods in chemotactic gradients. While tsuA(-) cells were able to couple receptor occupancy to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) production and actin polymerization, the PIP3 response was prolonged and basal F-actin levels were increased. Interestingly, TsuA localizes to the microtubule network and puncta mainly found at the cell periphery. Analysis of the gene uncovered a novel C-terminal domain that we designated the Tsunami Homology (TH) domain. Both the kinase domain and the TH domain are required to rescue the phenotypic defects of tsuA(-) cells. While kinase activity is not required for localization to microtubules, the TH domain is essential. Thus, localization of kinase activity to microtubules is critical for TsuA function. We propose that functions in association with the microtubule network may underlie the divergent roles of Fused kinase proteins in different organisms.",

This finding was intriguing because C. neoformans colonies are not pigmented unless they are provided with precursors for melanization. Strains of all C. neoformans serotypes produced brown pigment in response to K. aerogenes at 22, 30, and 37 degrees C. Pigment production required fungal laccase and was suppressed by high concentrations of glucose. Treatment of brown cells with guanidinium isothiocyanate and hot concentrated HCl yielded particulate material that had the physical and chemical characteristics of melanins. No pigment formation was observed when C. neoformans was exposed to live Escherichia coli or heat-killed K. aerogenes. Analysis of K. aerogenes supernatants revealed the presence of dopamine, which can be a substrate for melanin synthesis by C. neoformans. Our findings illustrate a remarkable interaction between a pathogenic fungus and a gram-negative bacterium, in which the bacterium produces a substrate that promotes fungal melanization. This observation provides a precedent that could explain the source of a substrate for C. neoformans melanization in the environment.",

        "abstract": "<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is the causative agent of a pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The facultative intracellular bacterium employs the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) and a plethora of translocated \"effector\" proteins to interfere with host vesicle trafficking pathways and establish a replicative niche, the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole (LCV). Internalization of the pathogen and the events immediately ensuing are accompanied by host cell-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) lipid changes and the Icm/Dot-controlled conversion of the LCV from a PtdIns(3)<i>P</i>-positive vacuole into a PtdIns(4)<i>P</i>-positive replication-permissive compartment, which tightly associates with the endoplasmic reticulum. The source and formation of PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> are ill-defined. Using dually labeled <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> amoebae and real-time high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we show here that nascent LCVs continuously capture and accumulate PtdIns(4)<i>P</i>-positive vesicles from the host cell. Trafficking of these PtdIns(4)<i>P</i>-positive vesicles to LCVs occurs independently of the Icm/Dot system, but their sustained association requires a functional T4SS. During the infection, PtdIns(3)<i>P</i>-positive membranes become compacted and segregated from the LCV, and PtdIns(3)<i>P</i>-positive vesicles traffic to the LCV but do not fuse. Moreover, using eukaryotic and prokaryotic PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> probes (2\u00d7PH<sub>FAPP</sub>-green fluorescent protein [2\u00d7PH<sub>FAPP</sub>-GFP] and P4C<sub>SidC</sub>-GFP, respectively) along with Arf1-GFP, we show that PtdIns(4)<i>P</i>-rich membranes of the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network associate with the LCV. Intriguingly, the interaction dynamics of 2\u00d7PH<sub>FAPP</sub>-GFP and P4C<sub>SidC</sub>-GFP are spatially separable and reveal the specific PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> pool from which the LCV PI originates. These findings provide high-resolution real-time insights into how <i>L. pneumophila</i> exploits the cellular dynamics of membrane-bound PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> for LCV formation.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The environmental bacterium <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> causes a life-threatening pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The bacteria grow intracellularly in free-living amoebae as well as in respiratory tract macrophages. To this end, <i>L. pneumophila</i> forms a distinct membrane-bound compartment called the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole (LCV). Phosphoinositide (PI) lipids are crucial regulators of the identity and dynamics of host cell organelles. The PI lipid PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> is a hallmark of the host cell secretory pathway, and decoration of LCVs with this PI is required for pathogen vacuole maturation. The source, dynamics, and mode of accumulation of PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> on LCVs are largely unknown. Using <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae producing different fluorescent probes as host cells, we show here that LCVs rapidly acquire PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> through the continuous interaction with PtdIns(4)<i>P</i>-positive host vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus. Thus, the PI lipid pattern of the secretory pathway contributes to the formation of the replication-permissive pathogen compartment.",

We report here that the activities of two Dnmt2 homologs, Pmt1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and DnmA from Dictyostelium discoideum, are strongly stimulated by prior queuosine (Q) modification of the substrate tRNA. In vivo tRNA methylation levels were stimulated by growth of cells in queuine-containing medium; in vitro Pmt1 activity was enhanced on Q-containing RNA; and queuine-stimulated in vivo methylation was abrogated by the absence of the enzyme that inserts queuine into tRNA, eukaryotic tRNA-guanine transglycosylase. Global analysis of tRNA methylation in S. pombe showed a striking selectivity of Pmt1 for tRNA(Asp) methylation, which distinguishes Pmt1 from other Dnmt2 homologs. The present analysis also revealed a novel Pmt1- and Q-independent tRNA methylation site in S. pombe, C34 of tRNA(Pro). Notably, queuine is a micronutrient that is scavenged by higher eukaryotes from the diet and gut microflora. This work therefore reveals an unanticipated route by which the environment can modulate tRNA modification in an organism.",

        "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila replicates within alveolar macrophages, causing a severe pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The bacterium resides within a vacuole that escapes immediate transport to the host lysosome. Instead, the vacuole interacts with the early secretory pathway to establish an environment suitable for rapid multiplication. A type IV secretion system is central to the pathogenicity of the bacterium, and many protein substrates that are translocated by this system to the host cell have been identified. One of these, VipD, was found to interrupt the late secretory pathway when overproduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We independently identified VipD in a previous study and have further characterized this protein as well as its three paralogs. The vipD gene belongs to a family of L. pneumophila open reading frames that are predicted to contain a phospholipase A domain with sequence similarity to the type III-secreted toxin ExoU from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly to other known translocated proteins of L. pneumophila, VipD is strongly induced in early stationary phase, a time when the bacterium is most virulent. Detergent extraction studies of infected macrophages confirm that VipD is translocated into host cells via the type IV secretion system. A second assay for translocation revealed that two paralogs of VipD, VpdA and VpdB, also have translocation signals recognized by the type IV system. A strain lacking VipD and its three paralogs grew at wild-type rates in murine macrophages, although secondary mutations that cause growth defects in strains lacking VipD accumulate. The quadruple mutant displayed a growth advantage in the amoebal host Dictyostelium discoideum, indicating that the protein family may modulate intracellular growth in a complex fashion. VipD is mildly toxic when overproduced in eukaryotic cells, and the toxicity is partially dependent on the putative phospholipase active site. VipD and its paralogs therefore define a family of translocated proteins that may assist in the establishment of a vacuole suitable for bacterial replication through functioning as a phospholipase.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum is an amoebozoa that exists in both a free-living unicellular and a multicellular form. It is situated in a deep branch in the evolutionary tree and is particularly noteworthy in having a very A/T-rich genome. Dictyostelium provides an ideal system to examine the extreme to which nucleotide bias may be employed in organizing promoters, genes, and nucleosomes across a genome. We find that Dictyostelium genes are demarcated precisely at their 5' ends by poly-T tracts and precisely at their 3' ends by poly-A tracts. These tracts are also associated with nucleosome-free regions and are embedded with precisely positioned TATA boxes. Homo- and heteropolymeric tracts of A and T demarcate nucleosome border regions. Together, these findings reveal the presence of a variety of functionally distinct polymeric A/T elements. Strikingly, Dictyostelium chromatin may be organized in di-nucleosome units but is otherwise organized as in animals. This includes a +1 nucleosome in a position that predicts the presence of a paused RNA polymerase II. Indeed, we find a strong phylogenetic relationship between the presence of the NELF pausing factor and positioning of the +1 nucleosome. Pausing and +1 nucleosome positioning may have coevolved in animals.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum MyoD, a long-tailed class I myosin, co-purified with two copies of a 16 kDa light chain. Sequence analysis of the MyoD light chain showed it to be a unique protein, termed MlcD, that shares 44% sequence identity with Dictyostelium calmodulin and 43% sequence identity with Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin IC light chain. MlcD comprises four EF-hands; however, EF-hands 2-4 contain mutations in key Ca2+-co-ordinating residues that would be predicted to impair Ca2+ binding. Electrospray ionization MS of MlcD in the presence of Ca2+ and La3+ showed the presence of one major and one minor metal-binding site. MlcD contains a single tryptophan residue (Trp39), the fluorescence intensity of which was quenched upon addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+, yielding apparent dissociation constants ( K'(d)) of 52 microM for Ca2+ and 450 microM for Mg2+. The low affinity of MlcD for Ca2+ indicates that it cannot function as a sensor of physiological Ca2+. Ca2+ did not affect the binding of MlcD to MyoD or to either of the two MyoD IQ (Ile-Gln) motifs. FLAG-MlcD expressed in Dictyostelium formed a complex with MyoD, but not with the two other long-tailed Dictyostelium myosin I isoenzymes, MyoB and MyoC. Through its specific association with the Ca2+-insensitive MlcD, MyoD may exhibit distinct regulatory properties that distinguish it from myosin I isoenzymes with calmodulin light chains.",

        "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is recognized as an important virulence mechanism in several Gram-negative pathogens. In Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, a minimum of three gene clusters--one main cluster and two auxiliary clusters--are required to form a functional T6SS apparatus capable of conferring virulence toward eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts. Despite an increasing understanding of the components that make up the T6SS apparatus, little is known about the regulation of these genes and the gene products delivered by this nanomachine. VasH is an important regulator of the V. cholerae T6SS. Here, we present evidence that VasH regulates the production of a newly identified protein, VasX, which in turn requires a functional T6SS for secretion. Deletion of vasX does not affect export or enzymatic function of the structural T6SS proteins Hcp and VgrG-1, suggesting that VasX is dispensable for the assembly of the physical translocon complex. VasX localizes to the bacterial membrane and interacts with membrane lipids. We present VasX as a novel virulence factor of the T6SS, as a V. cholerae mutant lacking vasX exhibits a phenotype of attenuated virulence toward Dictyostelium discoideum.",

To test this hypothesis, we examined intracellular survival of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (D. discoideum). Deletion of the E. coli ars operon led to significantly lower intracellular survival compared to wild type E. coli. This suggests that protists use arsenic to poison bacterial cells in the phagosome, similar to their use of copper. In response to copper and arsenic poisoning by protists, there is selection for acquisition of arsenic and copper resistance genes in the bacterial prey to avoid killing. In agreement with this hypothesis, both copper and arsenic resistance determinants are widespread in many bacterial taxa and environments, and they are often found together on plasmids. A role for heavy metals and arsenic in the ancient predator-prey relationship between protists and bacteria could explain the widespread presence of metal resistance determinants in pristine environments.",

They are not completely synthesized during DNA replication and are elongated by specific mechanisms. The structure of the telomeres and the elongation mechanism have not been determined in Dictyostelium discoideum. This organism presents extrachromosomal palindromic elements containing two copies of the rDNA, also present at the end of the chromosomes. In this article the structure of the terminal region of the rDNA is shown to consist of repetitions of the A(G)n sequence where the number of Gs is variable. These repeats extend as a 3' single stranded region. The G-rich region is preceded by four tandem repetitions of two different DNA motifs. D. discoideum telomere reverse transcriptase homologous protein (TERTHP) presented RNase-sensitive enzymatic activity and was required to maintain telomere structure since terthp-mutant strains presented reorganizations of the DNA terminal regions. These modifications were different in several terthp-mutants and changed with their prolonged culture and subcloning. However, the terthp gene is not essential for D. discoideum proliferation. Telomeres could be maintained in terthp-mutant strains by homologous recombination mechanisms such as ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) or HAATI (heterochromatin amplification-mediated and telomerase-independent). In agreement with this hypothesis, the expression of mRNAs coding for several proteins involved in homologous recombination was induced in terthp-mutant strains. Extrachromosomal rDNA could serve as substrate in these DNA homologous recombination reactions.",

The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> contains a gene coding for a dyskerin homologous protein. In this article <i>D. discoideum</i> mutant strains that have mutations corresponding to mutations found in dyskeratosis congenita patients are described. The phenotype of the mutant strains has been studied and no alterations were observed in pseudouridylation activity and telomere structure. Mutant strains showed increased proliferation on liquid culture but reduced growth feeding on bacteria. The results obtained indicated the existence of increased DNA damage response and reactive oxygen species, as also reported in human Dyskeratosis congenita cells and some other disease models. These data, together with the haploid character of <i>D. discoideum</i> vegetative cells, that resemble the genomic structure of the human dyskerin gene, located in the X chromosome, support the conclusion that <i>D. discoideum</i> can be a good model system for the study of this disease.",

Mutants lacking MyoG exhibit a wide range of normal actin-based behaviors, including chemotaxis to folic acid, but have a striking defect in polarization and chemotaxis to cAMP. Although the myoG mutants respond to cAMP stimulation by increasing persistence and weakly increasing levels of cortical F-actin, they do not polarize; instead, they maintain a round shape and move slowly and randomly when exposed to a chemotactic gradient. The mutants also fail to activate and localize PI3K to the membrane closest to the source of chemoattractant. These data reveal a role for a MyTH/FERM myosin in mediating early chemotactic signaling and suggest that MyTH/FERM proteins have conserved roles in signaling and the generation of cell polarity.",

In these habitats, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate) is prevalent and used as a phosphate storage compound or as a siderophore. L. pneumophila replicates in protozoa and mammalian phagocytes within a unique \"Legionella-containing vacuole.\" The bacteria govern host cell interactions through the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) and \u223c300 different \"effector\" proteins. Here we characterize a hitherto unrecognized Icm/Dot substrate, LppA, as a phytate phosphatase (phytase). Phytase activity of recombinant LppA required catalytically essential cysteine (Cys(231)) and arginine (Arg(237)) residues. The structure of LppA at 1.4 \u00c5 resolution revealed a mainly \u03b1-helical globular protein stabilized by four antiparallel \u03b2-sheets that binds two phosphate moieties. The phosphates localize to a P-loop active site characteristic of dual specificity phosphatases or to a non-catalytic site, respectively. Phytate reversibly abolished growth of L. pneumophila in broth, and growth inhibition was relieved by overproduction of LppA or by metal ion titration. L. pneumophila lacking lppA replicated less efficiently in phytate-loaded Acanthamoeba castellanii or Dictyostelium discoideum, and the intracellular growth defect was complemented by the phytase gene. These findings identify the chelator phytate as an intracellular bacteriostatic component of cell-autonomous host immunity and reveal a T4SS-translocated L. pneumophila phytase that counteracts intracellular bacterial growth restriction by phytate. Thus, bacterial phytases might represent therapeutic targets to combat intracellular pathogens.",

However, the mechanism is completely unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human SBDS and SBDS-EFL1 bound to Dictyostelium discoideum 60S ribosomal subunits with and without endogenous eIF6. SBDS assesses the integrity of the peptidyl (P) site, bridging uL16 (mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) with uL11 at the P-stalk base and the sarcin-ricin loop. Upon EFL1 binding, SBDS is repositioned around helix 69, thus facilitating a conformational switch in EFL1 that displaces eIF6 by competing for an overlapping binding site on the 60S ribosomal subunit.

        "abstract": "This paper describes the serendipitous discovery and first characterization of a new resistant cell type from Dictyostelium, for which the name aspidocyte (from aspis: Greek for shield) is proposed. These cells are induced from amoebae by a range of toxins including heavy metals and antibiotics, and were first detected by their striking resistance to detergent lysis. Aspidocytes are separate, rounded or irregular-shaped cells, which are immotile but remain fully viable; once the toxic stress is removed, they revert to amoeboid cells within an hour. Induction takes a few hours and is completely blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Aspidocytes lack a cell wall and their resistance to detergent lysis is active, requiring continued energy metabolism, and may be assisted by a complete cessation of endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the dye FM1-43. Microarray analysis shows that aspidocytes have a distinct pattern of gene expression, with a number of genes up-regulated that are predicted to be involved in lipid metabolism. Aspidocytes were initially detected in a hypersensitive mutant, in which the AMP deaminase gene is disrupted, suggesting that the inductive pathway involves AMP levels or metabolism. Since aspidocytes can also be induced from wild-type cells and are much more resistant than amoebae to a membrane-disrupting antibiotic, it is possible that they are an adaptation allowing Dictyostelium cells to survive a sudden onslaught of toxins in the wild.",

With the new microscope, we monitored diffusion motion of fluorescently labeled cAMP receptors of Dictyostelium discoideum at\u00a0both the basal and apical surfaces and obtained superresolution fluorescence images of microtubules of COS-7 cells at depths in the range 0-85 \u03bcm from the surface of a coverglass.",

During the cross-bridge cycle, functional sites in myosin 'sense' changes in interactions with actin filaments and the nucleotide binding region, resulting in allosteric transmission of information throughout the structure. We investigated whether the dynamics of the post-powerstroke state of the cross-bridge cycle are modulated in a nucleotide-dependent fashion. We compared molecular dynamics simulations of the myosin II motor domain (M) from Dictyostelium discoideum in the presence of ADP (M.ADP) versus 2'-deoxy-ADP bound myosin (M.dADP). We found that dADP was more flexible than ADP and the two nucleotides interacted with myosin in different ways. Replacement of ADP with dADP in the post-powerstroke state also altered the conformation of the actin binding region in myosin heads. Our results provide atomic level insights into allosteric communication networks in myosin that provide insight into the nucleotide-dependent dynamics of the cross-bridge cycle.",

        "abstract": "The phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is a key signaling molecule and binding partner for many intracellular proteins. PS is normally found on the inner surface of the cell membrane, but PS can be flipped to the outer surface in a process called PS exposure. PS exposure is important in many cell functions, yet the mechanisms that control PS exposure have not been extensively studied. Copines (Cpn), found in most eukaryotic organisms, make up a family of calcium-dependent phospholipid binding proteins. In Dictyostelium, which has six copine genes, CpnA strongly binds to PS and translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to a rise in calcium. Cells lacking the cpnA gene (cpnA-) have defects in adhesion, chemotaxis, membrane trafficking, and cytokinesis. In this study we used both flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy to show that cpnA- cells have increased adhesion to beads and bacteria and that the increased adhesion was not due to changes in the actin cytoskeleton or cell surface proteins. We found that cpnA- cells bound higher amounts of Annexin V, a PS binding protein, than parental cells and showed that unlabeled Annexin V reduced the increased cell adhesion property of cpnA- cells. We also found that cpnA- cells were more sensitive to Polybia-MP1, which binds to external PS and induces cell lysis. Overall, this suggests that cpnA- cells have increased PS exposure and this property contributes to the increased cell adhesion of cpnA- cells. We conclude that CpnA has a role in the regulation of plasma membrane lipid composition and may act as a negative regulator of PS exposure.",

        "abstract": "Macropinocytosis is a conserved endocytic process used by <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae for feeding on liquid medium. To further <i>Dictyostelium</i> as a model for macropinocytosis, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay to measure macropinocytosis, and used it to identify inhibitors and investigate the physiological regulation of macropinocytosis. <i>Dictyostelium</i> has two feeding states: phagocytic and macropinocytic. When cells are switched from phagocytic growth on bacteria to liquid media, the rate of macropinocytosis slowly increases, due to increased size and frequency of macropinosomes. Upregulation is triggered by a minimal medium containing three amino acids plus glucose and likely depends on macropinocytosis itself. The presence of bacteria suppresses macropinocytosis while their product, folate, partially suppresses upregulation of macropinocytosis. Starvation, which initiates development, does not of itself suppress macropinocytosis: this can continue in isolated cells, but is shut down by a conditioned-medium factor or activation of PKA signalling. Thus macropinocytosis is a facultative ability of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells, regulated by environmental conditions that are identified here.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

        "abstract": "Several recent studies have demonstrated that eukaryotic cells, including amoeboid cells of Dictyostelium discoideum and neutrophils, respond to chemoattractants by translocation of PH-domain proteins to the cell membrane, where these proteins participate in the modulation of the cytoskeleton and relay of the signal. When the chemoattractant is released from a pipette, the localization is found predominantly on the proximal side of the cell. The recruitment of PH-domain proteins, particularly for Dictyostelium cells, occurs very rapidly (<2 s). Thus, the mechanism responsible for the first step in the directional sensing process of a cell must be able to establish an asymmetry on the same time scale. Here, we propose a simple mechanism in which a second messenger, generated by local activation of the membrane, diffuses through the interior of the cell, suppresses the activation of the back of the cell, and converts the temporal gradient into an initial cellular asymmetry. Numerical simulations show that such a mechanism is plausible. Available evidence suggests that the internal inhibitor may be cGMP, which accumulates within less than a second following treatment of cells with external cAMP.",

DCAF7 (also termed WDR68 or HAN11) is a cellular binding partner of DYRK1A and also regulates signalling by the protein kinase HIPK2. DCAF7 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with a single WD40 repeat domain and has no catalytic activity. We have defined a DCAF7 binding motif of 12 amino acids in the N-terminal domain of class 1 DYRKs that is functionally conserved in DYRK1 orthologs from Xenopus, Danio rerio and the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. A similar sequence was essential for DCAF7 binding to HIPK2, whereas the closely related HIPK1 family member did not bind DCAF7. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments identified DCAF7 as an adaptor for the association of the adenovirus E1A protein with DYRK1A and HIPK2. Furthermore, DCAF7 was required for the hyperphosphorylation of E1A in DYRK1A or HIPK2 overexpressing cells. Our results characterize DCAF7 as a substrate recruiting subunit of DYRK1A and HIPK2 and suggest that it is required for the negative effect of DYRK1A on E1A-induced oncogenic transformation.",

Developing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells undergo highly efficient dedifferentiation, completed by most cells within 24 hr. We use this rapid response to investigate the control features of dedifferentiation, combining single cell imaging with high temporal resolution transcriptomics. Gene expression during dedifferentiation was predominantly a simple reversal of developmental changes, with expression changes not following this pattern primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis. Mutation of genes induced early in dedifferentiation did not strongly perturb the reversal of development. This apparent robustness may arise from adaptability of cells: the relative temporal ordering of cell and molecular events was not absolute, suggesting cell programmes reach the same end using different mechanisms. In addition, although cells start from different fates, they rapidly converged on a single expression trajectory. These regulatory features may contribute to dedifferentiation responses during regeneration.",

The present study is the first to report that cells move away from the site of injury in response to local wounding. When a migrating Dictyostelium cell was locally wounded at its anterior region by laserporation, the cell retracted its anterior pseudopods, extended a new pseudopod at the posterior region, and migrated in the opposite direction with increasing velocity. When wounded in the posterior region, the cell did not change its polarity and moved away from the site of wounding. Since the cells repair wounds within a short period, we successfully manipulated cell migration by applying multiple wounds. Herein, we discussed the signals that contributed to the wound-induced escape behavior of Dictyostelium cells.

Since the former can be regarded as the basis to realize the latter, playing essential roles in various cellular functions, it is important to investigate spontaneous movement quantitatively at different physiological conditions in relation to a cell's physiological functions. For that purpose, we observed a series of spontaneous movements by Dictyostelium cells at different developmental periods by using a single cell tracking system. Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells showed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity distribution had power-law tails in all conditions. Furthermore, as development proceeded, average velocity and persistency of the movement increased and as too did the exponential behavior in the velocity distribution. Based on these results, we succeeded in applying a generalized Langevin model to the experimental data. With this model, we discuss the relation of spontaneous cell movement to cellular physiological function and its relevance to behavioral strategies for cell survival.",

Here, we report that Sey1/Atl3 and Rtn4 localize to early LCVs and are critical for pathogen vacuole formation. Sey1 overproduction promotes intracellular growth of <i>L. pneumophila</i>, whereas a catalytically inactive, dominant-negative GTPase mutant protein, or Atl3 depletion, restricts pathogen replication and impairs LCV maturation. Sey1 is not required for initial recruitment of ER to PtdIns(4)<i>P</i>-positive LCVs but for subsequent pathogen vacuole expansion.

        "abstract": "Multiresistant and invasive hypervirulent <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> strains have become one of the most urgent bacterial pathogen threats. Recent analyses revealed a high genomic plasticity of this species, harboring a variety of mobile genetic elements associated with virulent strains, encoding proteins of unknown function whose possible role in pathogenesis have not been addressed. <i>K. pneumoniae</i> virulence has been studied mainly in animal models such as mice and pigs, however, practical, financial, ethical and methodological issues limit the use of mammal hosts. Consequently, the development of simple and cost-effective experimental approaches with alternative host models is needed. In this work we described the use of both, the social amoeba and professional phagocyte <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and the fish <i>Danio rerio</i> (zebrafish) as surrogate host models to study <i>K. pneumoniae</i> virulence. We compared three <i>K. pneumoniae</i> clinical isolates evaluating their resistance to phagocytosis, intracellular survival, lethality, intestinal colonization, and innate immune cells recruitment. Optical transparency of both host models permitted studying the infective process <i>in vivo</i>, following the <i>Klebsiella</i>-host interactions through live-cell imaging. We demonstrated that <i>K. pneumoniae</i> RYC492, but not the multiresistant strains 700603 and BAA-1705, is virulent to both host models and elicits a strong immune response. Moreover, this strain showed a high resistance to phagocytosis by <i>D. discoideum</i>, an increased ability to form biofilms and a more prominent and irregular capsule. Besides, the strain 700603 showed the unique ability to replicate inside amoeba cells. Genomic comparison of the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> strains showed that the RYC492 strain has a higher overall content of virulence factors although no specific genes could be linked to its phagocytosis resistance, nor to the intracellular survival observed for the 700603 strain. Our results indicate that both zebrafish and <i>D. discoideum</i> are advantageous host models to study different traits of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> that are associated with virulence.",

The chemotactic movement of the soil amoeba Dictyostelium to folate or other pterin compounds released by bacteria is a well-documented foraging mechanism. Acanthamoeba can also feed on bacteria but relatively little is known about the mechanism(s) by which this amoeba locates bacteria. Acanthamoeba movement in the presence of folate or bacteria was analyzed in above agar assays and compared to that observed for Dictyostelium. The overall mobility of Acanthamoeba was robust like that of Dictyostelium but Acanthamoeba did not display a chemotactic response to folate. In the presence of bacteria, Acanthamoeba only showed a marginal bias in directed movement whereas Dictyostelium displayed a strong chemotactic response. A comparison of genomes revealed that Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium share some similarities in G protein signaling components but that specific G proteins used in Dictyostelium chemotactic responses were not present in current Acanthamoeba genome sequence data. The results of this study suggest that Acanthamoeba does not use chemotaxis as the primary mechanism to find bacterial food sources and that the chemotactic responses of Dictyostelium to bacteria may have co-evolved with chemotactic responses that facilitate multicellular development.",

When the relatively minor subset of prevalently hydrophobic segments is discarded from the set of low-complexity segments identified by current segmentation methods in P. falciparum proteins, a good correspondence is found between prevalently hydrophilic low-complexity segments and the species-specific, rapidly diverging insertions detected by multiple-alignment procedures when sequences of bona fide homologs are available. Amino acid preferences are fairly uniform in the set of hydrophilic low-complexity segments identified in the two P. falciparum chromosomes sequenced, as well as in sequenced genes from Plasmodium berghei, but differ from those observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Dictyostelium discoideum. In the two plasmodial species, amino acid frequencies do not correlate with properties such as hydrophilicity, small volume, or flexibility, which might be expected to characterize residues involved in nonglobular domains but do correlate with A-richness in codons. An effect of phenotypic selection versus neutral drift, however, is suggested by the predominance of asparagine over lysine.",

Dictyostelium amoebae show striking electrotaxis in an applied direct current electric field. Perhaps electrotaxis and chemotaxis share similar signaling mechanisms? Null mutation of Gbeta and cAMP receptor 1 and Galpha2 did not abolish electrotaxis, although Gbeta-null mutations showed suppressed electrotaxis. By contrast, G protein signaling plays an essential role in chemotaxis. G protein-coupled receptor signaling was monitored with PHcrac-green fluorescent protein, which translocates to inositol phospholipids at the leading edge of cells during chemotaxis. There was no intracellular gradient of this protein during electrotaxis. However, F-actin was polymerized at the leading edge of cells during electrotaxis. We conclude that reception and transduction of the electrotaxis signal are largely independent of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and that the pathways driving chemotaxis and electrotaxis intersect downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins to invoke cytoskeletal elements.",

        "abstract": "Food searching strategies of animals are key to their success in heterogeneous environments. The optimal search strategy may include specialized random walks such as Levy walks with heavy power-law tail distributions, or persistent walks with preferred movement in a similar direction. We have investigated the movement of the soil amoebae Dictyostelium searching for food. Dictyostelium cells move by extending pseudopodia, either in the direction of the previous pseudopod (persistent step) or in a different direction (turn). The analysis of approximately 4000 pseudopodia reveals that step and turn pseudopodia are drawn from a probability distribution that is determined by cGMP/PLA2 signaling pathways. Starvation activates these pathways thereby suppressing turns and inducing steps. As a consequence, starved cells make very long nearly straight runs and disperse over approximately 30-fold larger areas, without extending more or larger pseudopodia than vegetative cells. This 'win-stay/lose-shift' strategy for food searching is called Starvation Induced Run-length Extension. The SIRE walk explains very well the observed differences in search behavior between fed and starving organisms such as bumble-bees, flower bug, hoverfly and zooplankton.",

However, the molecular network necessary for spontaneous symmetry breaking has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that, in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the spatiotemporal dynamics of GTP bound Ras (Ras-GTP) breaks the symmetry due its intrinsic excitability even in the absence of extracellular spatial cues and downstream signaling activities. A stochastic excitation of local and transient Ras activation induced phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) accumulation via direct interaction with Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), causing tightly coupled traveling waves that propagated along the membrane. Comprehensive phase analysis of the waves of Ras-GTP and PIP3 metabolism-related molecules revealed the network structure of the excitable system including positive-feedback regulation of Ras-GTP by the downstream PIP3. A mathematical model reconstituted a series of the observed symmetry-breaking phenomena, illustrating the essential involvement of Ras excitability in the cellular decision-making process.",

        "abstract": "There are 13 Dictyostelium Src homology 2 (SH2) domain proteins, almost 10-fold fewer than in mammals, and only three are functionally unassigned. One of these, LrrB, contains a novel combination of protein interaction domains: an SH2 domain and a leucine-rich repeat domain. Growth and early development appear normal in the mutant, but expression profiling reveals that three genes active at these stages are greatly underexpressed: the ttdA metallohydrolase, the abcG10 small molecule transporter, and the cinB esterase. In contrast, the multigene family encoding the lectin discoidin 1 is overexpressed in the disruptant strain. LrrB binds to 14-3-3 protein, and the level of binding is highest during growth and decreases during early development. Comparative tandem affinity purification tagging shows that LrrB also interacts, via its SH2 domain and in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, with two novel proteins: CldA and CldB. Both of these proteins contain a Clu domain, a >200-amino acid sequence present within highly conserved eukaryotic proteins required for correct mitochondrial dispersal. A functional interaction of LrrB with CldA is supported by the fact that a cldA disruptant mutant also underexpresses ttdA, abcG10, and cinB. Significantly, CldA is itself one of the three functionally unassigned SH2 domain proteins. Thus, just as in metazoa, but on a vastly reduced numerical scale, an interacting network of SH2 domain proteins regulates specific Dictyostelium gene expression.",

The genetic/molecular model <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian phagocytes share mechanistic pathways for chemotaxis and phagocytosis; <i>Dictyostelium</i> chemotax toward bacteria and phagocytose them as food sources. We quantified <i>Dictyostelium</i> chemotaxis towards live gram positive and gram negative bacteria and demonstrate high sensitivity to multiple bacterially-secreted chemoattractants. Additive/competitive assays indicate that intracellular signaling-networks for multiple ligands utilize independent upstream adaptive mechanisms, but common downstream targets, thus amplifying detection at low signal propagation, but strengthening discrimination of multiple inputs. Finally, analyses of signaling-networks for chemotaxis and phagocytosis indicate that chemoattractant receptor-signaling is not essential for bacterial phagocytosis.",

        "abstract": "We used microarrays carrying most of the genes that are developmentally regulated in Dictyostelium to discover those that are preferentially expressed in prestalk cells. Prestalk cells are localized at the front of slugs and play crucial roles in morphogenesis and slug migration. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we were able to verify 104 prestalk genes. Three of these were found to be expressed only in cells at the very front of slugs, the PstA cell type. Another 10 genes were found to be expressed in the small number of cells that form a central core at the anterior, the PstAB cell type. The rest of the prestalk-specific genes are expressed in PstO cells, which are found immediately posterior to PstA cells but anterior to 80% of the slug that consists of prespore cells. Half of these are also expressed in PstA cells. At later stages of development, the patterns of expression of a considerable number of these prestalk genes changes significantly, allowing us to further subdivide them. Some are expressed at much higher levels during culmination, while others are repressed. These results demonstrate the extremely dynamic nature of cell-type-specific expression in Dictyostelium and further define the changing physiology of the cell types. One of the signals that affect gene expression in PstO cells is the hexaphenone DIF-1. We found that expression of about half of the PstO-specific genes were affected in a mutant that is unable to synthesize DIF-1, while the rest appeared to be DIF independent. These results indicate that differentiation of some aspects of PstO cells can occur in the absence of DIF-1.",

However, the specific innate effector functions that mediate this pathogen resistance are largely unknown. Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway, plays a role in controlling intracellular bacterial pathogen infections in cultured cells, but less is known about its role at the organismal level. We examined the effects of autophagy gene inactivation on Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium) infection in 2 model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum. In both organisms, genetic inactivation of the autophagy pathway increases bacterial intracellular replication, decreases animal lifespan, and results in apoptotic-independent death. In C. elegans, genetic knockdown of autophagy genes abrogates pathogen resistance conferred by a loss-of-function mutation, daf-2(e1370), in the insulin-like tyrosine kinase receptor or by over-expression of the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor. Thus, autophagy genes play an essential role in host defense in vivo against an intracellular bacterial pathogen and mediate pathogen resistance in long-lived mutant nematodes.",

Here, we examine cell shape and movement in starved Dictyostelium amoebae during migration toward a chemoattractant in a microfluidic chamber. We show that the incredible variety in amoeboid shape across a population can be reduced to a few modes of variation. Interestingly, cells use distinct modes depending on the applied chemical gradient, with specific cell shapes associated with shallow, difficult-to-sense gradients. Modelling and drug treatment reveals that these behaviours are intrinsically linked with accurate sensing at the physical limit. Since similar behaviours are observed in a diverse range of cell types, we propose that cell shape and behaviour are conserved traits.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium Formin C (ForC) is involved in the regulation of local actin cytoskeleton reorganization (e.g. during cellular adhesion or migration). ForC contains formin homology 2 and 3 (FH2 and -3) domains and an N-terminal putative GTPase-binding domain (GBD) but lacks a canonical FH1 region. To better understand the role of the GBD, its structure, dynamics, lipid-binding properties, and cellular functions were analyzed by NMR and CD spectroscopy and by in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, the program CS-Rosetta was tested for the structure prediction based on chemical shift data only. The ForC GBD adopts an ubiquitin-like \u03b1/\u03b2-roll fold with an unusually long loop between \u03b2-strands 1 and 2. Based on the lipid-binding data, the presence of DPC micelles induces the formation of \u03b1-helical secondary structure and a rearrangement of the tertiary structure. Lipid-binding studies with a mutant protein and a peptide suggest that the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop is not relevant for these conformational changes. Whereas small amounts of negatively charged phosphoinositides (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate)) lower the micelle concentration necessary to induce the observed spectral changes, other negatively charged phospholipids (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-L-serine) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)) had no such effect. Interestingly, bicelles and micelles composed of diacylphosphocholines had no effect on the GBD structure. Our data suggest a model in which part of the large positively charged surface area of the GBD mediates localization to specific membrane patches, thereby regulating interactions with signaling proteins. Our cellular localization studies show that both the GBD and the FH3 domain are required for ForC targeting to cell-cell contacts and early phagocytic cups and macropinosomes.",

We describe its complete structure elucidation, as well as its synergistic activity against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, when in combination with mupirocin. Both biosynthetic gene clusters are regulated by quorum-sensing systems, with 3-oxo-decanoyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C10-AHL) and hexanoyl homoserine lactone (C6-AHL) being the respective signal molecules.

        "abstract": "Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Q, a nucleotide exchange factor from Dictyostelium discoideum, is a 143-kD protein containing RasGEF domains and a DEP domain. We show that RasGEF Q can bind to F-actin, has the potential to form complexes with myosin heavy chain kinase (MHCK) A that contain active RasB, and is the predominant exchange factor for RasB. Overexpression of the RasGEF Q GEF domain activates RasB, causes enhanced recruitment of MHCK A to the cortex, and leads to cytokinesis defects in suspension, phenocopying cells expressing constitutively active RasB, and myosin-null mutants. RasGEF Q(-) mutants have defects in cell sorting and slug migration during later stages of development, in addition to cell polarity defects. Furthermore, RasGEF Q(-) mutants have increased levels of unphosphorylated myosin II, resulting in myosin II overassembly. Collectively, our results suggest that starvation signals through RasGEF Q to activate RasB, which then regulates processes requiring myosin II.",

        "abstract": "Multicellular organization is particularly vulnerable to conflicts between different cell types when the body forms from initially isolated cells, as in aggregative multicellular microbes. Like other functions of the multicellular phase, coordinated collective movement can be undermined by conflicts between cells that spend energy in fuelling motion and 'cheaters' that get carried along. The evolutionary stability of collective behaviours against such conflicts is typically addressed in populations that undergo extrinsically imposed phases of aggregation and dispersal. Here, via a shift in perspective, we propose that aggregative multicellular cycles may have emerged as a way to temporally compartmentalize social conflicts. Through an eco-evolutionary mathematical model that accounts for individual and collective strategies of resource acquisition, we address regimes where different motility types coexist. Particularly interesting is the oscillatory regime that, similarly to life cycles of aggregative multicellular organisms, alternates on the timescale of several cell generations phases of prevalent solitary living and starvation-triggered aggregation. Crucially, such self-organized oscillations emerge as a result of evolution of cell traits associated to conflict escalation within multicellular aggregates.",

        "abstract": "One poorly understood mechanism of developmental patterning involves the intermingled differentiation of different cell types that then sort out to generate pattern. Examples of this are known in nematodes and vertebrates, and in Dictyostelium it is the major mechanism. However, a general problem with this mechanism is the possibility that different inducers are required for each cell type that arises independently of positional information. Consistent with this idea, in Dictyostelium the signalling molecule DIF acts as a position-independent signal and was thought only to regulate the differentiation of a single cell type (pstO). The results presented here challenge this idea. In a novel genetic selection to isolate genes required for DIF signal transduction, we found a mutant (dimC(-)) that is a hypomorphic allele of a GATA family transcription factor (gtaC). gtaC expression is directly regulated by DIF, and GtaC rapidly translocates to the nucleus in response to DIF. gtaC(-) null cells showed some hallmark DIF signalling defects. Surprisingly, other aspects of the mutant were distinct from those of other DIF signalling mutants, suggesting that gtaC regulates a subset of DIF responses. For example, pstO cell differentiation appeared normal. However, we found that pstB cells were mislocalised and the pstB-derived basal disc was much reduced or missing. These defects are due to a failure to respond to DIF as they are phenocopied in other DIF signalling mutants. These findings therefore identify a novel small-molecule-activated GATA factor that is required to regulate the cell type-specific effects of DIF. They also reveal that a non-positional signal can regulate the differentiation of multiple cell types through differential interpretation in receiving cells.",

        "abstract": "The protein clathrin mediates one of the major pathways of endocytosis from the extracellular milieu and plasma membrane. In single-cell eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the gene encoding clathrin is not an essential gene, raising the question of whether clathrin conveys specific advantages for multicellularity. Furthermore, in contrast to mammalian cells, endocytosis in S. cerevisiae is not dependent on either clathrin or adaptor protein 2 (AP2), an endocytic adaptor molecule. In this study, we investigated the requirement for components of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in another unicellular organism, the amoeba Dictyostelium. We identified a heterotetrameric AP2 complex in Dictyostelium that is similar to that which is found in higher eukaryotes. By simultaneously imaging fluorescently tagged clathrin and AP2, we found that, similar to higher eukaryotes, these proteins colocalized to membrane puncta that move into the cell together. In addition, the contractile vacuole marker protein, dajumin-green fluorescent protein (GFP), is trafficked via the cell membrane and internalized by CME in a clathrin-dependent, AP2-independent mechanism. This pathway is distinct from other endocytic mechanisms in Dictyostelium. Our finding that CME is required for the internalization of contractile vacuole proteins from the cell membrane explains the contractile vacuole biogenesis defect in Dictyostelium cells lacking clathrin. Our results also suggest that the machinery for CME and its role in organelle maintenance appeared early during eukaryotic evolution. We hypothesize that dependence of endocytosis on specific components of the CME pathway evolved later, as demonstrated by internalization independent of AP2 function.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium amoebae faced with starvation trigger a developmental program during which many cells aggregate and form fruiting bodies that consist of a ball of spores held aloft by a thin stalk. This developmental strategy is open to several forms of exploitation, including the remarkable case of Dictyostelium caveatum, which, even when it constitutes 1/10(3) of the cells in an aggregate, can inhibit the development of the host and eventually devour it. We show that it accomplishes this feat by inhibiting a region of cells, called the tip, which organizes the development of the aggregate into a fruiting body. We use live-cell microscopy to define the D. caveatum developmental cycle and to show that D. caveatum amoebae have the capacity to ingest amoebae of other Dictyostelid species, but do not attack each other. The block in development induced by D. caveatum does not affect the expression of specific markers of prespore cell or prestalk cell differentiation, but does stop the coordinated cell movement leading to tip formation. The inhibition mechanism involves the constitutive secretion of a small molecule by D. caveatum and is reversible. Four Dictyostelid species were inhibited in their development, while D. caveatum is not inhibited by its own compound(s). D. caveatum has evolved a predation strategy to exploit other members of its genus, including mechanisms of developmental inhibition and specific phagocytosis.",

Upon inhalation of bacteria-laden aerosols, the opportunistic pathogens grow intracellularly in alveolar macrophages and can cause a life-threatening pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. Intracellular replication in amoebae and macrophages takes place in a unique membrane-bound compartment, the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole (LCV). LCV formation requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system, which translocates literally hundreds of \"effector\" proteins into host cells, where they modulate crucial cellular processes for the pathogen's benefit. The mechanism of LCV formation appears to be evolutionarily conserved, and therefore, amoebae are not only ecologically significant niches for <i>Legionella</i> spp., but also useful cellular models for eukaryotic phagocytes. In particular, <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> and <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> emerged over the last years as versatile and powerful models. Using genetic, biochemical and cell biological approaches, molecular interactions between amoebae and <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> have recently been investigated in detail with a focus on the role of phosphoinositide lipids, small and large GTPases, autophagy components and the retromer complex, as well as on bacterial effectors targeting these host factors.",

We first constructed a 70 base oligomer microarray that assays 3366 predicted genes. To estimate the relative gene expression levels and changes in gene expression during conidial germination, we analyzed a circuit design of competitive hybridizations throughout a time course using a Bayesian analysis of gene expression level. Remarkable consistency of mRNA profiles with previously published northern data was observed. Genes were hierarchically clustered into groups with respect to their expression profiles over the time course of conidial germination. A functional classification database was employed to characterize the global picture of gene expression. Consensus motif searches identified a putative regulatory component associated with genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Our transcriptional profiling data correlate well with biochemical and physiological processes associated with conidial germination and will facilitate functional predictions of novel genes in N.crassa and other filamentous ascomycete species. Furthermore, our dataset on conidial germination allowed comparisons to transcriptional mechanisms associated with germination processes of diverse propagules, such as teliospores of the phytopathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis and spores of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.",

Cells were modeled as a shape machine that protrudes or retracts in response to a combination of local protrusion and global retraction signals. Using an optimization algorithm to identify parameters that generate specific shapes and migration patterns, we show that the mechanism of local stimulation global inhibition can readily account for the behavior of Dictyostelium under a large collection of conditions. Within this collection, some parameters showed strong correlation, indicating that a normal phenotype may be maintained by complementation among functional modules. In addition, comparison of parameters for control and nocodazole-treated Dictyostelium identified the most prominent effect of microtubules as regulating the rates of retraction and protrusion signal decay, and the extent of global inhibition. Other changes in parameters can lead to profound transformations from amoeboid cells into cells mimicking keratocytes, neurons, or fibroblasts. Thus, a simple circuit of local stimulation-global inhibition can account for a wide range of cell behaviors. A similar top-down approach may be applied to other complex problems and combined with molecular manipulations to define specific protein functions.",

        "abstract": "The de novo synthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate uses several pathways: gram-negative bacteria use deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminase to convert deoxycytidine triphosphate into deoxyuridine triphosphate, whereas eukaryotes and gram-positive bacteria instead use deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase to transform deoxycytidine monophosphate to deoxyuridine monophosphate. It is then unusual that in addition to deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminases, the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum has 2 deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminases (Dcd1Dicty and Dcd2Dicty). Expression of either DcdDicty can fully rescue the slow growth of an Escherichia coli dcd knockout. Both DcdDicty mitigate the hydroxyurea sensitivity of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase knockout. Phylogenies show that Dcd1Dicty homologs may have entered the common ancestor of the eukaryotic groups of Amoebozoa, Obazoa, Metamonada, and Discoba through an ancient horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote or an ancient endosymbiotic gene transfer from a mitochondrion, followed by horizontal gene transfer from Amoebozoa to several other unrelated groups of eukaryotes. In contrast, the Dcd2Dicty homologs were a separate horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote or a virus into either Amoebozoa or Rhizaria, followed by a horizontal gene transfer between them. ThyXDicty, the D. discoideum thymidylate synthase, another enzyme of the deoxythymidine triphosphate biosynthesis pathway, was suggested previously to be acquired from the ancestral mitochondria or by horizontal gene transfer from alpha-proteobacteria. ThyXDicty can fully rescue the E. coli thymidylate synthase knockout, and we establish that it was obtained by the common ancestor of social amoebae not from mitochondria but from a bacterium. We propose horizontal gene transfer and endosymbiotic gene transfer contributed to the enzyme diversity of the deoxythymidine triphosphate synthesis pathway in most social amoebae, many Amoebozoa, and other eukaryotes.",

To understand fitness differences between spores and cysts, we measured long-term survival of spores and cysts under climate-mimicking conditions, investigated spore and cyst ultrastructure, and related fitness characteristics to species ecology. We found that spores and cysts survived 22\u2009\u00b0C equally well, but that spores survived wet and dry frost better than cysts, with group 4 spores being most resilient. Spore walls consist of three layers and those of cysts of maximally two, while spores were also more compacted than cysts, with group 4 spores being the\u00a0most compacted. Group 4 species were frequently isolated from arctic and alpine zones, which was rarely the case for group 1-3 species.

To examine this, we used a FRET-based cAMP sensor that possesses high cAMP sensitivity and great temporal resolution. We show the transient profile of cAMP accumulation in live Dictyostelium cells and establish that chemoattractants control intracellular cAMP dynamics by regulating synthesis via the adenylyl cyclase ACA. aca(-) cells show no significant change in FRET response following chemoattractant addition. Furthermore, cells lacking ACB, the other adenylyl cyclase expressed in chemotaxing cells, behave similarly to wild-type cells. We also establish that the RegA is the major phosphodiesterase that degrades intracellular cAMP in chemotaxis-competent cells. Interestingly, we failed to measure intracellular cAMP compartmentalization in actively chemotaxing cells. We conclude that cytosolic cAMP, which is destined to activate PKA, is regulated by ACA and RegA and does not compartmentalize during chemotaxis.",

Nevertheless, a clearly identifiable, mitochondrion-encoded 5S rRNA is present in Acanthamoeba castellanii, a member of Amoebozoa. During a search for additional mitochondrial 5S rRNAs, we detected small abundant RNAs in other members of Amoebozoa, namely, in the lobose amoeba Hartmannella vermiformis and in the myxomycete slime mold Physarum polycephalum. These RNAs are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), cosediment with mitoribosomes in glycerol gradients, and can be folded into a secondary structure similar to that of bona fide 5S rRNAs. Further, in the mtDNA of another slime mold, Didymium nigripes, we identified a region that in sequence, potential secondary structure, and genomic location is similar to the corresponding region encoding the Physarum small RNA. A mtDNA-encoded small RNA previously identified in Dictyostelium discoideum is here shown to share several characteristics with known 5S rRNAs. Again, we detected genes encoding potential homologs of this RNA in the mtDNA of three other species of the genus Dictyostelium as well as in a related genus, Polysphondylium. Taken together, our results indicate a widespread occurrence of small, abundant, mtDNA-encoded RNAs with 5S rRNA-like structures that are associated with the mitoribosome in various amoebozoan taxa. Our working hypothesis is that these novel small abundant RNAs represent radically divergent mitochondrial 5S rRNA homologs. We posit that currently unrecognized 5S-like RNAs may exist in other mitochondrial systems in which a conventional 5S rRNA cannot be identified.",

        "title": "A new Dictyostelium prestalk cell sub-type.",
        "abstract": "The mature fruiting body of Dictyostelium consists of stalk and spore cells but its construction, and the migration of the preceding slug stage, requires a number of specialized sub-types of prestalk cell whose nature and function are not well understood. The prototypic prestalk-specific gene, ecmA, is inducible by the polyketide DIF-1 in a monolayer assay and requires the DimB and MybE transcription factors for full inducibility. We perform genome-wide microarray analyses, on parental, mybE- and dimB- cells, and identify many additional genes that depend on MybE and DimB for their DIF-1 inducibility. Surprisingly, an even larger number of genes are only DIF inducible in mybE- cells, some genes are only inducible in DimB- cells and some are inducible when either transcription factor is absent. Thus in assay conditions where MybE and DimB function as inducers of ecmA these genes fall under negative control by the same two transcription factors. We have studied in detail rtaA, one of the MybE and DimB repressed genes. One especially enigmatic group of prestalk cells is the anterior-like cells (ALCs), which exist intermingled with prespore cells in the slug. A promoter fusion reporter gene, rtaA:gal(u), is expressed in a subset of the ALCs that is distinct from the ALC population detected by a reporter construct containing ecmA and ecmB promoter fragments. At culmination, when the ALC sort out from the prespore cells and differentiate to form three ancillary stalk cell structures: the upper cup, the lower cup and the outer basal disk, the rtaA:gal(u) expressing cells preferentially populate the upper cup region. This fact, and their virtual absence from the anterior and posterior regions of the slug, identifies them as a new prestalk sub-type: the pstU cells. PstU cell differentiation is, as expected, increased in a dimB- mutant during normal development but, surprisingly, they differentiate normally in a mutant lacking DIF. Thus genetic removal of MybE or DimB reveals an alternate DIF-1 activation pathway, for pstU differentiation, that functions under monolayer assay conditions but that is not essential during multicellular development.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium constitutes a genetically tractable model for the analysis of autophagic cell death (ACD). During ACD, Dictyostelium cells first transform into paddle cells and then become round, synthesize cellulose, vacuolize, and die. Through random insertional mutagenesis, we identified the receptor histidine kinase DhkM as being essential for ACD. Surprisingly, different DhkM mutants showed distinct nonvacuolizing ACD phenotypes. One class of mutants arrested ACD at the paddle cell stage, perhaps through a dominant-negative effect. Other mutants, however, progressed further in the ACD program. They underwent rounding and cellulose synthesis but stopped before vacuolization. Moreover, they underwent clonogenic but not morphological cell death. Exogenous 8-bromo-cAMP restored vacuolization and death. A role for a membrane receptor at a late stage of the ACD pathway is puzzling, raising questions as to which ligand it is a receptor for and which moieties it phosphorylates. Together, DhkM is the most downstream-known molecule required for this model ACD, and its distinct mutants genetically separate previously undissociated late cell death events.",

Dictyostelium, a eukaryotic microbe widely used as a developmental model, has a social fruiting stage in which some formerly independent individuals die to help others. To assess genetic variation within the social amoeba Dictyostelium purpureum, we sequenced approximately 4000 base pairs of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from 37 isolates collected in Texas, Virginia, and Japan. Our analysis showed extensive genetic variation between populations and clear evidence of phylogenetic structure. We identified three major phylogenetic groups that were more different than other accepted species pairs. Tests using pairs of clones showed that both sexual macrocyst and asexual fruiting body formation were influenced by genetic divergence. Macrocysts were less likely to form between pairs of clones from different groups than from the same group. There was also a correlation between the genetic divergence of a pair of clones and their degree of mixing within fruiting bodies. These observations suggest that cryptic species might occur within D. purpureum and, more importantly, reveal how genetic variation impacts social interactions.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular asymmetry in the signaling network works as a compass to navigate eukaryotic chemotaxis in response to guidance cues. Although the compass variable can be derived from a self-organization dynamics, such as excitability, the responsible mechanism remains to be clarified. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) pathway, which is crucial for chemotaxis. We show that spontaneous activation of PtdInsP3-enriched domains is generated by an intrinsic excitable system. Formation of the same signal domain could be triggered by various perturbations, such as short impulse perturbations that triggered the activation of intrinsic dynamics to form signal domains. We also observed the refractory behavior exhibited in typical excitable systems. We show that the chemotactic response of PtdInsP3 involves biasing the spontaneous excitation to orient the activation site toward the chemoattractant. Thus, this biased excitability embodies the compass variable that is responsible for both random cell migration and biased random walk. Our finding may explain how cells achieve high sensitivity to and robust coordination of the downstream activation that allows chemotactic behavior in the noisy environment outside and inside the cells.",

        "abstract": "Many amoeboid cells move by extending pseudopods. Here I present a new stochastic model for chemotaxis that is based on pseudopod extensions by Dictyostelium cells. In the absence of external cues, pseudopod extension is highly ordered with two types of pseudopods: de novo formation of a pseudopod at the cell body in random directions, and alternating right/left splitting of an existing pseudopod that leads to a persistent zig-zag trajectory. We measured the directional probabilities of the extension of splitting and de novo pseudopods in chemoattractant gradients with different steepness. Very shallow cAMP gradients can bias the direction of splitting pseudopods, but the bias is not perfect. Orientation of de novo pseudopods require much steeper cAMP gradients and can be more precise. These measured probabilities of pseudopod directions were used to obtain an analytical model for chemotaxis of cell populations. Measured chemotaxis of wild-type cells and mutants with specific defects in these stochastic pseudopod properties are similar to predictions of the model. These results show that combining splitting and de novo pseudopods is a very effective way for cells to obtain very high sensitivity to stable gradient and still be responsive to changes in the direction of the gradient.",

Similarly architectured phosphatases exist among other protozoa, such as Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania major, and Trypanosoma cruzi. MPL1 was strongly induced after 5 h of development; ablation by homologous recombination led to defective streaming and aggregation during development. In addition, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-pulsed mpl1(-) cells showed reduced random and directional motility. At the molecular level, mpl1(-) cells displayed higher prestimulus and persistent poststimulus ERK2 phosphorylation in response to cAMP stimulation. Consistent with their phenotype of persistent ERK2 phosphorylation, mpl1(-) cells also displayed an aberrant pattern of cAMP production, resembling that of the regA(-) cells. Reintroduction of a full-length MPL1 into mpl1(-) cells restored aggregation, ERK2 regulation, random and directional motility, and cAMP production similar to wild-type cells. We propose that MPL1 is a novel phosphatase essential for proper regulation of ERK2 phosphorylation and optimal motility during development.",

        "abstract": "Even in the absence of guidance cues, chemotactic cells are often spontaneously motile, which should accompany a spontaneous symmetry breaking inside the cells. A shallow chemoattractant gradient can induce these cells to move directionally without much change in cell morphology. As the gradient becomes steeper, the accuracy of chemotaxis increases. It is not clear how the steepness is expressed or encoded internally in the signaling network, which in turn coordinately activates the motile apparatus for chemotaxis. In Dictyostelium cells, self-organizing polarization activities in the signaling network have been reported. In this paper, we conducted a theoretical study of the response of this self-organizing system to guidance cues. Our analyses indicate that self-organizing systems respond sharply to a shallow external gradient by increasing the precision of polarity direction and modulating the frequency of self-polarization. We also show how the precision increase and frequency modulation are achieved. Our results indicate that self-organizing activity, independent of external cues, is the basis for the sensitive and robust response to shallow gradients. Finally, we show that the system can sense the direction of space-time waves of a stimulus, for which Dictyostelium cells exhibit chemotaxis in the developmental process.",

Using tagged mutagenesis to find missing pathway components, we identified a sporeless mutant defective in a nuclear protein, SpaA. Expression of prespore genes was strongly reduced in spaA- cells, while expression of many spore stage genes was absent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of a SpaA-YFP gene fusion showed that (pre)spore gene promoters bind directly to SpaA, identifying SpaA as a transcriptional regulator. SpaA dependent spore gene expression required PKA in vivo and was stimulated in vitro by the membrane-permeant PKA agonist 8Br-cAMP. The PKA agonist also promoted SpaA binding to (pre)spore promoters, placing SpaA downstream of PKA. Sequencing of SpaA-YFP ChIPed DNA fragments revealed that SpaA binds at least 117 (pre)spore promoters, including those of other transcription factors that activate some spore genes. These factors are not in turn required for spaA expression, identifying SpaA as the major trancriptional inducer of sporulation.",

The basis of this correlation is an underlying memory of direction. The presence of memory in movement is known for many decades, but its molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. This study reports in detail on the information content of directional memory, the kinetics of learning and forgetting this information, and the molecular basis for memory using Dictyostelium mutants. Two types of memory were characterized. A short-term memory stores for ~20 seconds the position of the last pseudopod using a local modification of the branched F-actin inducer SCAR/WAVE, which enhances one new pseudopod to be formed at the position of the previous pseudopod. A long term memory stores for ~2 minutes the activity of the last ~10 pseudopods using a cGMP-binding protein that induces myosin filaments in the rear of the cell; this inhibits pseudopods in the rear and thereby enhances pseudopods in the global front. Similar types of memory were identified in human neutrophils and mesenchymal stem cells, the protist Dictyostelium and the fungus B.d. chytrid. The synergy of short- and long-term memory explains their role in persistent movement for enhanced cell dispersal, food seeking and chemotaxis.",

To identify novel chemotaxis inhibitors as probes for mechanistic studies and leads for development of new therapeutics, we developed a unique, unbiased phenotypic chemotaxis-dependent Dictyostelium aggregation assay for high-throughput screening using rapid, laser-scanning cytometry. Under defined conditions, individual Dictyostelium secrete chemoattractants, migrate, and aggregate. Chemotaxis is quantified by laser-scanning cytometry with a GFP marker expressed only in cells after chemotaxis/multi-cell aggregation. We applied the assay to screen 1,280 known compounds in a 1536-well plate format and identified two chemotaxis inhibitors. The chemotaxis inhibitory activities of both compounds were confirmed in both Dictyostelium and in human neutrophils in a directed EZ-TAXIscan chemotaxis assay. The compounds were also shown to inhibit migration of two human cancer cell lines in monolayer scratch assays. This test screen demonstrated that the miniaturized assay is extremely suited for high-throughput screening of very large libraries of small molecules to identify novel classes of chemotaxis/migratory inhibitors for drug development and research tools for targeting chemotactic pathways universal to humans and other systems.",

        "abstract": "It is generally assumed that single cells in an isogenic population, when exposed to identical environments, exhibit the same behavior. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that, even in a genetically identical population, cellular behavior can vary significantly among cells. Here we explore this variability in the gradient-sensing response of Dictyostelium cells when exposed to repeated spatiotemporal pulses of chemoattractant. Our experiments show the response of a single cell to be highly reproducible from pulse to pulse. In contrast, a large variability in the response direction and magnitude is observed from cell to cell, even when different cells are exposed to the same pulse. First, these results indicate that the gradient-sensing network has inherent asymmetries that can significantly impact the ability of cells to faithfully sense the direction of extracellular signals (cellular asymmetry). Second, we find that the magnitude of this asymmetry varies greatly among cells. Some cells are able to accurately follow the direction of an extracellular stimulus, whereas, in other cells, the intracellular asymmetry dominates, resulting in a polarization axis that is independent of the direction of the extracellular cue (cellular individuality). We integrate these experimental findings into a model that treats the effective signal a cell detects as the product of the extracellular signal and the asymmetric intracellular signal. With this model we successfully predict the population response. This cellular individuality and asymmetry might fundamentally limit the fidelity of signal detection; in contrast, however, it might be beneficial by diversifying phenotypes in isogenic populations.",

This lamin mutant assembled into supramolecular, three-dimensional clusters in the cytosol that disassembled at the onset of mitosis and re-assembled in late telophase, thus mimicking the behavior of the endogenous protein. As disassembly is regulated by CDK1-mediated phosphorylation at serine 122, we generated a phosphomimetic S122E mutant called GFP-NE81-S122E-\u0394NLS\u0394CLIM. Surprisingly, during imaging, the fusion protein assembled into cytosolic clusters, similar to the protein lacking the phosphomimetic mutation. Clusters disassembled again in the darkness. Assembly could be induced with blue but not green or near ultraviolet light, and it was independent of the fusion tag. Assembly similarly occurred upon cell flattening. Earlier reports and own observations suggested that both blue light and cell flattening could result in a decrease of intracellular pH. Indeed, keeping the cells at low pH also reversibly induced cluster formation. Our results indicate that lamin assembly can be induced by various stress factors and that these are transduced via intracellular acidification. Although these effects have been shown in a phosphomimetic CDK1 mutant of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> lamin, they are likely relevant also for wild-type lamin.",

To address how this is achieved, we investigated how transcriptional bursting is entrained by a naturally oscillating signal, by direct measurement of transcription together with signal dynamics in living cells. We identify a Dictyostelium gene showing rapid transcriptional oscillations with the same period as extracellular cAMP signaling waves. Bursting approaches antiphase to cAMP waves, with accelerating transcription cycles during differentiation. Although coupling between signal and transcription oscillations was clear at the population level, single-cell transcriptional bursts retained considerable heterogeneity, indicating that transcription is not governed solely by signaling frequency. Previous studies implied that burst heterogeneity reflects distinct chromatin states. Here we show that heterogeneity is determined by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic cues and is maintained by a transcriptional persistence. Unusually for a persistent transcriptional behavior, the lifetime was only 20 min, with rapid randomization of transcriptional state by the response to oscillatory signaling. Linking transcription to rapid signaling oscillations allows reduction of gene expression heterogeneity by temporal averaging, providing a mechanism to generate precision in cell choices during development.",

        "abstract": "The role of Skp1 as an adaptor protein that links Cullin-1 to F-box proteins in E3 Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases is well characterized. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium and probably many other unicellular eukaryotes, Skp1 is modified by a pentasaccharide attached to a hydroxyproline near its C terminus. This modification is important for oxygen-sensing during Dictyostelium development and is mediated by a HIF-\u03b1 type prolyl 4-hydroxylase and five sequentially acting cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase activities. Gene disruption studies show that AgtA, the enzyme responsible for addition of the final two galactose residues, in \u03b1-linkages to the Skp1 core trisaccharide, is unexpectedly critical for oxygen-dependent terminal development. AgtA possesses a WD40 repeat domain C-terminal to its single catalytic domain and, by use of domain deletions, binding studies, and enzyme assays, we find that the WD40 repeats confer a salt-sensitive second-site binding interaction with Skp1 that mediates novel catalytic activation in addition to simple substrate recognition. In addition, AgtA binds similarly well to precursor isoforms of Skp1 by a salt-sensitive mechanism that competes with binding to an F-box protein and recognition by early modification enzymes, and the effect of binding is diminished when AgtA modifies Skp1. Genetic studies show that loss of AgtA is more severe when an earlier glycosylation step is blocked, and overexpressed AgtA is deleterious if catalytically inactivated. Together, the findings suggest that AgtA mediates non-enzymatic control of unmodified and substrate precursor forms of Skp1 by a binding mechanism that is normally relieved by switch-like activation of its glycosylation function.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium amoebae grow as single cells but upon starvation they initiate multicellular development. Phg2 was characterized previously as a kinase controlling cellular adhesion and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we report that Phg2 also plays a role during the transition between growth and multicellular development, as evidenced by the fact that phg2 mutant cells can initiate development even in the presence of nutrients. Even at low cell density and in rich medium, phg2 mutant cells express discoidin, one of the earliest predevelopmental markers. Complementation studies indicate that, in addition to the kinase domain, the core region of Phg2 is involved in the initiation of development. In this region, a small domain contiguous with a previously described ras-binding domain was found to interact with the Dictyostelium ortholog of the mammalian adhesion-regulating molecule (ADRM1). In addition, adrm1 knockout cells also exhibit abnormal initiation of development. These results suggest that a Phg2-Adrm1 signaling pathway is involved in the control of the transition from growth to differentiation in Dictyostelium. Phg2 thus plays a dual role in the control of cellular adhesion and initiation of development.",

        "abstract": "The generation of multiple fates from a uniform cell population via self-organisation is a recurring feature in development and regeneration. However, for most self-organising systems, we have little understanding of the processes that allow cells to become different. One of the clearest examples of developmental self-organisation is shown by <i>Dictyostelium</i>, with cells segregating into two major fates, stalk and spore, within multicellular aggregates. To characterise the gene expression decisions that underlie this cell fate bifurcation, we carried out single cell transcriptomics on <i>Dictyostelium</i> aggregates. Our data show the transition of progenitors into prespore and prestalk cells occurs via distinct developmental intermediates. Few cells were captured switching between states, with minimal overlap in fate marker expression between cell types, suggesting states are discrete and transitions rapid. Surprisingly, fate-specific transcript dynamics were a small proportion of overall gene expression changes, with transcript divergence coinciding precisely with large-scale remodelling of the transcriptome shared by prestalk and prespore cells. These observations suggest the stepwise separation of cell identity is temporally coupled to global expression transitions common to both fates.",

        "abstract": "Recently, we recognized two genes, gbpA and gbpB, encoding putative cGMP-binding proteins with a Zn(2+)-hydrolase domain and two cyclic nucleotide binding domains. The Zn(2+)-hydrolase domains belong to the superfamily of beta-lactamases, also harboring a small family of class II phosphodiesterases from bacteria and lower eukaryotes. Gene inactivation and overexpression studies demonstrate that gbpA encodes the cGMP-stimulated cGMP-phosphodiesterase that was characterized biochemically previously and was shown to be involved in chemotaxis. cAMP neither activates nor is a substrate of GbpA. The gbpB gene is expressed mainly in the multicellular stage and seems to encode a dual specificity phosphodiesterase with preference for cAMP. The enzyme hydrolyses cAMP approximately 9-fold faster than cGMP and is activated by cAMP and cGMP with a K(A) value of approximately 0.7 and 2.3 microM, respectively. Cells with a deletion of the gbpB gene have increased basal and receptor stimulated cAMP levels and are sporogeneous. We propose that GbpA and GbpB hydrolyze the substrate in the Zn(2+)-hydrolase domain, whereas the cyclic nucleotide binding domains mediate activation. The human cGMP-stimulated cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase has similar biochemical properties, but a completely different topology: hydrolysis takes place by a class I catalytic domain and GAF domains mediate cGMP activation.",

A Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain protein, TirA, was also required for some S cell functions and for vegetative amoebae to feed on live bacteria.

CBP7, one of the 14 CBPs, is composed of 169 amino acids and contains four EF-hand motifs. Here, we investigated the roles of CBP7 in the development and cell migration of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells and found that high levels of CBP7 exerted a negative effect on cells aggregation during development, possibly by inhibiting chemoattractant-directed cell migration. While cells lacking CBP7 exhibited normal development and chemotaxis similar that of wild-type cells, CBP7 overexpressing cells completely lost their chemotactic abilities to move toward increasing cAMP concentrations. This resulted in inhibition of cellular aggregation, a process required for forming multicellular organisms during development. Low levels of cytosolic free calcium were observed in CBP7 overexpressing cells, which was likely the underlying cause of their lack of chemotaxis. Our results demonstrate that CBP7 plays an important role in cell spreading and cell-substrate adhesion. <i>cbp7</i> null cells showed decreased cell size and cell-substrate adhesion.

        "abstract": "Members of the VPS13 family are associated with various human diseases. In particular, the loss of function of VPS13A leads to chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), a rare neurodegenerative disease without available curative treatments. Autophagy has been considered a promising therapeutic target because the absence of VPS13A causes a defective autophagy flux. However, the mechanistic details of this deficiency are unknown. Here, we identified Rab7A as an interactor of one of the VPS13 family members in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and showed that this interaction is conserved between the human homologs VPS13A and RAB7A in HeLa cells. As RAB7A is a key player in endosome trafficking, we addressed the possible function of VPS13A in endosome dynamics and lysosome degradation. Our results suggest that the decrease in autophagy observed in the absence of VPS13A may be the result of a more general defect in endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation. Unexpectedly, we found that VPS13A is closely localized to mitochondria, suggesting that the role of VPS13A in the endolysosomal pathway might be related to inter-organelle communication. We show that VPS13A localizes at the interface between mitochondria-endosomes and mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum and that the presence of membrane contact sites is altered in the absence of VPS13A. Based on these findings, we propose that therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the endolysosomal pathway could be beneficial in the treatment of ChAc.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

Previous results have shown 3'-PIs to be important for regulating basal cell motility and sensing the direction and strength of the chemoattractant gradient. We examined the chemotaxis of wild-type cells and cells lacking PTEN or PI3K1 and 2 using analytical methods that allowed us to quantitatively discern differences between the genotype's ability to sense and efficiently respond to changes in gradient steepness during chemotaxis. We found that cells are capable of increasing their chemotactic accuracy and speed as they approach a micropipette in a manner that is dependent on the increasing strength of the concentration gradient and 3'-PI signaling. Further, our data show that 3'-PI signaling affects a cell's ability to coordinate speed and direction to increase chemotactic efficiency. Using to our knowledge a new measurement of chemotactic efficiency that reveals the degree of coordination between speed and accuracy, we found that cells also have the capacity to increase their chemotactic efficiency as they approach the micropipette. Like directional accuracy and speed, the increase in chemotactic efficiency of cells with increased gradient strength is sensitive to 3'-PI dysregulation. Our evidence suggests that receptor-driven 3'-PI signaling regulates the ability of a cell to capitalize on stronger directional inputs and minimize the effects of inaccurate turns to increase chemotactic efficiency.",

Compared with wild-type cells, aprA-null cells proliferate faster, while AprA overexpressing cells proliferate slower. Growing wild-type cells secrete a factor that inhibits the proliferation of wild-type and aprA- cells; this activity is not secreted by aprA- cells. AprA purified by immunoprecipitation also slows the proliferation of wild-type and aprA- cells. Compared with wild type, there is a higher percentage of multinucleate cells in the aprA- population, and when starved, aprA- cells form abnormal structures that contain fewer spores. AprA may thus decrease the number of multinucleate cells and increase spore production. Together, the data suggest that AprA functions as part of a Dictyostelium chalone.",

        "abstract": "Cell motility is a fundamental process with relevance to embryonic development, immune response, and metastasis. Cells move either spontaneously, in a nondirected fashion, or in response to chemotactic signals, in a directed fashion. Even though they are often studied separately, both forms of motility share many complex processes at the molecular and subcellular scale, e.g., orchestrated cytoskeletal rearrangements and polarization. In addition, at the cellular level both types of motility include persistent runs interspersed with reorientation pauses. Because there is a great range of variability in motility among different cell types, a key challenge in the field is to integrate these multiscale processes into a coherent framework. We analyzed the motility of Dictyostelium cells with bimodal analysis, a method that compares time spent in persistent versus reorientation mode. Unexpectedly, we found that reorientation time is coupled with persistent time in an inverse correlation and, surprisingly, the inverse correlation holds for both nondirected and chemotactic motility, so that the full range of Dictyostelium motility can be described by a single scaling relationship. Additionally, we found an identical scaling relationship for three human cell lines, indicating that the coupling of reorientation and persistence holds across species and making it possible to describe the complexity of cell motility in a surprisingly general and simple manner. With this new perspective, we analyzed the motility of Dictyostelium mutants, and found four in which the coupling between two modes was altered. Our results point to a fundamental underlying principle, described by a simple scaling law, unifying mechanisms of eukaryotic cell motility at several scales.",

        "abstract": "Oxygen sensing is a near universal signaling modality that, in eukaryotes ranging from protists such as Dictyostelium and Toxoplasma to humans, involves a cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylase that utilizes oxygen and \u03b1-ketoglutarate as potentially rate-limiting substrates. A divergence between the animal and protist mechanisms is the enzymatic target: the animal transcriptional factor subunit hypoxia inducible factor-\u03b1 whose hydroxylation results in its poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and the protist E3SCF ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp1 whose hydroxylation might control the stability of other proteins. In Dictyostelium, genetic studies show that hydroxylation of Skp1 by PhyA, and subsequent glycosylation of the hydroxyproline, is required for normal oxygen sensing during multicellular development at an air/water interface. Because it has been difficult to detect an effect of hypoxia on Skp1 hydroxylation itself, the role of Skp1 modification was investigated in a submerged model of Dictyostelium development dependent on atmospheric hyperoxia.",

        "abstract": "Stereotyped behaviors are series of postures that show very little variability between repeats. They have been used to classify the dynamics of individuals, groups and species without reference to the lower-level mechanisms that drive them. Stereotypes are easily identified in animals due to strong constraints on the number, shape, and relative positions of anatomical features, such as limbs, that may be used as landmarks for posture identification. In contrast, the identification of stereotypes in single cells poses a significant challenge as the cell lacks these landmark features, and finding constraints on cell shape is a non-trivial task. Here, we use the maximum caliber variational method to build a minimal model of cell behavior during migration. Without reference to biochemical details, we are able to make behavioral predictions over timescales of minutes using only changes in cell shape over timescales of seconds. We use drug treatment and genetics to demonstrate that maximum caliber descriptors can discriminate between healthy and aberrant migration, thereby showing potential applications for maximum caliber methods in automated disease screening, for example in the identification of behaviors associated with cancer metastasis.",

        "abstract": "During the aggregation of Dictyostelium cells, signaling through RasG is more important in regulating cyclic AMP (cAMP) chemotaxis, whereas signaling through RasC is more important in regulating the cAMP relay. However, RasC is capable of substituting for RasG for chemotaxis, since rasG\u207b cells are only partially deficient in chemotaxis, whereas rasC\u207b/rasG\u207b cells are totally incapable of chemotaxis. In this study we have examined the possible functional overlap between RasG and RasC in vegetative cells by comparing the vegetative cell properties of rasG\u207b, rasC\u207b, and rasC\u207b/rasG\u207b cells. In addition, since RasD, a protein not normally found in vegetative cells, is expressed in vegetative rasG\u207b and rasC\u207b/rasG\u207b cells and appears to partially compensate for the absence of RasG, we have also examined the possible functional overlap between RasG and RasD by comparing the properties of rasG\u207b and rasC\u207b/rasG\u207b cells with those of the mutant cells expressing higher levels of RasD. The results of these two lines of investigation show that RasD is capable of totally substituting for RasG for cytokinesis and growth in suspension, whereas RasC is without effect. In contrast, for chemotaxis to folate, RasC is capable of partially substituting for RasG, but RasD is totally without effect. Finally, neither RasC nor RasD is able to substitute for the role that RasG plays in regulating actin distribution and random motility. These specificity studies therefore delineate three distinct and none-overlapping functions for RasG in vegetative cells.",

        "abstract": "After serving the Dictyostelium community for many years, the first version of dictyBase (Chisholm et al., 2006; Fey et al., 2006) was in need of a decisive update. The original dictyBase software was not adaptable to more current demands such as handling the import of large-scale data from recently sequenced genomes, keeping up with changes in the Gene Ontology (GO), or handling the automatic annotation of over 20,000 new strains. Therefore, we have embarked on a complete overhaul of dictyBase. The new infrastructure will allow the introduction of new data, such as more expressive GO annotations and Dictyostelium disease orthologs. A modern user interface aims to streamline usage of the database including orders from the Dicty Stock Center (DSC). New displays will allow novel views including the combination of data in two new tools. With the underlying software infrastructure now in place, dictyBase software engineers and curators are currently adding the user interfaces, new tools and content pages for the evolving version 2.0 of dictyBase. This review highlights the emerging status of the new dictyBase, updated pages and annotations that will soon be available in the new environment, an overview of our annotation procedures, and plans to involve the community in curation efforts.",

        "abstract": "Living cells are constantly subjected to various mechanical stimulations, such as shear flow, osmotic pressure, and hardness of substratum. They must sense the mechanical aspects of their environment and respond appropriately for proper cell function. Cells adhering to substrata must receive and respond to mechanical stimuli from the substrata to decide their shape and/or migrating direction. In response to cyclic stretching of the elastic substratum, intracellular stress fibers in fibroblasts and endothelial, osteosarcoma, and smooth muscle cells are rearranged perpendicular to the stretching direction, and the shape of those cells becomes extended in this new direction. In the case of migrating Dictyostelium cells, cyclic stretching regulates the direction of migration, and not the shape, of the cell. The cells migrate in a direction perpendicular to that of the stretching. However, the molecular mechanisms that induce the directional migration remain unknown. Here, using a microstretching device, we recorded green fluorescent protein (GFP)-myosin-II dynamics in Dictyostelium cells on an elastic substratum under cyclic stretching. Repeated stretching induced myosin II localization equally on both stretching sides in the cells. Although myosin-II-null cells migrated randomly, myosin-II-null cells expressing a variant of myosin II that cannot hydrolyze ATP migrated perpendicular to the stretching. These results indicate that Dictyostelium cells accumulate myosin II at the portion of the cell where a large strain is received and migrate in a direction other than that of the portion where myosin II accumulated. This polarity generation for migration does not require the contraction of actomyosin.",

        "abstract": "Stimulation of transcription by extracellular signals is a major component of a cell's decision making. Yet the quantitative relationship between signal and acute transcriptional response is unclear. One view is that transcription is directly graded with inducer concentration. In an alternative model, the response occurs only above a threshold inducer concentration. Standard methods for monitoring transcription lack continuous information from individual cells or mask immediate-early transcription by measuring downstream protein expression. We have therefore used a technique for directly monitoring nascent RNA in living cells, to quantify the direct transcriptional response to an extracellular signal in real time, in single cells. At increasing doses of inducer, increasing numbers of cells displayed a transcriptional response. However, over the same range of doses, the change in cell response strength, measured as the length, frequency and intensity of transcriptional pulses, was small, with considerable variation between cells. These data support a model in which cells have different sensitivities to developmental inducer and respond in a digital manner above individual stimulus thresholds. Biased digital responses may be necessary for certain forms of developmental specification. Limiting bias in responsiveness is required to reduce noise in positional signalling.",

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) has emerged as a central player in controlling actin polymerization. We have investigated WASP function and its regulation in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells and demonstrated the specific and essential role of WASP in organizing polarized F-actin assembly in chemotaxing cells. Cells expressing very low levels of WASP show reduced F-actin levels and significant defects in polarized F-actin assembly, resulting in an inability to establish axial polarity during chemotaxis. GFP-WASP preferentially localizes at the leading edge and uropod of chemotaxing cells and the B domain of WASP is required for the localization of WASP. We demonstrated that the B domain binds to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 with similar affinities. The interaction between the B domain and PI(3,4,5)P3 plays an important role for the localization of WASP to the leading edge in chemotaxing cells.

In the absence of external cues, cells move in random directions, but with a strong element of persistence that keeps them moving in the same direction Persistence allows cells to disperse over larger areas and is instrumental to enter new environments where spatial cues can lead the cell. Here we explore cell movement by analyzing the direction, size and timing of approximately 2000 pseudopodia that are extended by Dictyostelium cells. The results show that pseudpopod are extended perpendicular to the surface curvature at the place where they emerge. The location of new pseudopods is not random but highly ordered. Two types of pseudopodia may be formed: frequent splitting of an existing pseudopod, or the occasional extension of a de novo pseudopod at regions devoid of recent pseudopod activity. Split-pseudopodia are extended at approximately 60 degrees relative to the previous pseudopod, mostly as alternating Right/Left/Right steps leading to relatively straight zigzag runs. De novo pseudopodia are extended in nearly random directions thereby interrupting the zigzag runs. Persistence of cell movement is based on the ratio of split versus de novo pseudopodia. We identify PLA2 and cGMP signaling pathways that modulate this ratio of splitting and de novo pseudopodia, and thereby regulate the dispersal of cells. The observed ordered extension of pseudopodia in the absence of external cues provides a fundamental insight into the coordinated movement of cells, and might form the basis for movement that is directed by internal or external cues.",

Moreover, exposure to cAMP gradients leads to asymmetric distribution of the inhibitory components. The gradients induce a stable accumulation of the PIP3 reporter PHCrac-GFP in the front of cells near the cAMP source. Rapid withdrawal of the gradient led to the reassociation of G protein subunits, and the return of the PIP3 phosphatase PTEN and PHCrac-GFP to their pre-stimulus distribution. Reapplication of cAMP stimulation produces a clear PHCrac-GFP translocation to the back but not to the front, indicating that a stronger inhibition is maintained in the front of a polarized cell.

While most of our knowledge of actin-driven eukaryotic motility was obtained from cells that move on planar open surfaces, recent work has demonstrated that confinement can lead to strongly altered motile behavior. Here, we report experimental evidence that motile amoeboid cells undergo a spontaneous symmetry breaking in confined interstitial spaces. Inside narrow channels, the cells switch to a highly persistent, unidirectional mode of motion, moving at a constant speed along the channel. They remain in contact with the two opposing channel side walls and alternate protrusions of their leading edge near each wall. Their actin cytoskeleton exhibits a characteristic arrangement that is dominated by dense, stationary actin foci at the side walls, in conjunction with less dense dynamic regions at the leading edge. Our experimental findings can be explained based on an excitable network model that accounts for the confinement-induced symmetry breaking and correctly recovers the spatio-temporal pattern of protrusions at the leading edge. Since motile cells typically live in the narrow interstitial spacings of tissue or soil, we expect that the geometry-driven polarity we report here plays an important role for movement of cells in their natural environment.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium discoideum amoebas coordinate aggregation and morphogenesis by secreting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pulses that propagate as waves through fields of cells and multicellular structures. To retrace how this mechanism for self-organisation evolved, we studied the origin of the cAMP phosphodiesterase PdsA and its inhibitor PdiA, which are essential for cAMP wave propagation. D. discoideum and other species that use cAMP to aggregate reside in group 4 of the four major groups of Dictyostelia. We found that groups 1-3 express a non-specific, low affinity orthologue of PdsA, which gained cAMP selectivity and increased 200-fold in affinity in group 4. A low affinity group 3 PdsA only partially restored aggregation of a D. discoideum pdsA-null mutant, but was more effective at restoring fruiting body morphogenesis. Deletion of a group 2 PdsA gene resulted in disruption of fruiting body morphogenesis, but left aggregation unaffected. Together, these results show that groups 1-3 use a low affinity PdsA for morphogenesis that is neither suited nor required for aggregation. PdiA belongs to a family of matrix proteins that are present in all Dictyostelia and consist mainly of cysteine-rich repeats. However, in its current form with several extensively modified repeats, PdiA is only present in group 4. PdiA is essential for initiating spiral cAMP waves, which, by organising large territories, generate the large fruiting structures that characterise group 4. We conclude that efficient cAMP-mediated aggregation in group 4 evolved by recruitment and adaptation of a non-selective phosphodiesterase and a matrix component into a system for regulated cAMP degradation.",

We measured this response in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells, indicating that this is an evolutionarily conserved, general response to mechanical stress. In Dictyostelium, the number of autophagosomes increased 20-fold within 10 min of 1 kPa pressure being applied and a similar response was seen in mammalian cells after 30 min. We showed in both cell types that autophagy is highly sensitive to changes in mechanical pressure and the response is graduated, with half-maximal responses at ~0.2 kPa, similar to other mechano-sensitive responses. We further showed that the mechanical induction of autophagy is TOR-independent and transient, lasting until the cells adapt to their new environment and recover their shape. The autophagic response is therefore part of an integrated response to mechanical challenge, allowing cells to cope with a continuously changing physical environment.",

Lineage-specific genes were found to be enriched among genes with biased expression (predominant expression in one developmental stage) in each species and at most developmental time points, suggesting independent functional innovations of new genes throughout the phylogeny. Biased duplicate genes had greater expression divergence than their orthologs and paralogs, consistent with subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. Lineage-specific expansions in particular had biased genes with both molecular signals of positive selection and high expression, suggesting adaptive genetic and transcriptional diversification following duplication. Our results present insights into the potential contributions of lineage-specific genes and families in generating species-specific phenotypes during multicellular development in dictyostelids.",

        "abstract": "In the field of cell and tissue engineering, there is an increasing demand for techniques to spatially control the adhesion of cells to substrates of desired sizes and shapes. Here, we describe two novel methods for fabricating a substrate for adhesion of cells to a defined area. In the first method, the surface of the coverslip or plastic dish was coated with Lipidure, a non-adhesive coating material, and air plasma was applied through a mask with holes, to confer adhesiveness to the surface. In the second method, after the surface of the coverslip was coated with gold by sputtering and then with Lipidure; the Lipidure coat was locally removed using a novel scanning laser ablation method. These methods efficiently confined cells within the adhesive area and enabled us to follow individual cells for a longer duration, compared to the currently available commercial substrates. By following single cells within the confined area, we were able to observe several new aspects of cell behavior in terms of cell division, cell-cell collisions, and cell collision with the boundary between adhesive and non-adhesive areas.",

        "abstract": "Natural chemical gradients to which cells respond chemotactically are often dynamic, with both spatial and temporal components. A primary example is the social amoeba Dictyostelium, which migrates to the source of traveling waves of chemoattractant as part of a self-organized aggregation process. Despite its physiological importance, little is known about how cells migrate directionally in response to traveling waves. The classic back-of-the-wave problem is how cells chemotax toward the wave source, even though the spatial gradient reverses direction in the back of the wave. Here, we address this problem by using microfluidics to expose cells to traveling waves of chemoattractant with varying periods. We find that cells exhibit memory and maintain directed motion toward the wave source in the back of the wave for the natural period of 6 min, but increasingly reverse direction for longer wave periods. Further insights into cellular memory are provided by experiments quantifying cell motion and localization of a directional-sensing marker after rapid gradient switches. The results can be explained by a model that couples adaptive directional sensing to bistable cellular memory. Our study shows how spatiotemporal cues can guide cell migration over large distances.",

        "title": "Chemotaxis: a feedback-based computational model robustly predicts multiple aspects of real cell behaviour.",
        "abstract": "The mechanism of eukaryotic chemotaxis remains unclear despite intensive study. The most frequently described mechanism acts through attractants causing actin polymerization, in turn leading to pseudopod formation and cell movement. We recently proposed an alternative mechanism, supported by several lines of data, in which pseudopods are made by a self-generated cycle. If chemoattractants are present, they modulate the cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. The aim of this work is to test the explanatory and predictive powers of such pseudopod-based models to predict the complex behaviour of cells in chemotaxis. We have now tested the effectiveness of this mechanism using a computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudopod autocatalysis. The model reproduces a surprisingly wide range of existing data about cell movement and chemotaxis. It simulates cell polarization and persistence without stimuli and selection of accurate pseudopods when chemoattractant gradients are present. It predicts both bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients and--unexpectedly--lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients. To test the predictive ability of the model, we looked for untested and novel predictions. One prediction from the model is that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient. We measured the angles between pseudopods in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells under different conditions and found the results agreed with the model extremely well. Our model and data together suggest that in rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils an intrinsic pseudopod cycle lies at the heart of cell motility. This implies that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behaviour, more than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants.",

        "abstract": "We have identified a DNA methyltransferase of the Dnmt2 family in Dictyostelium that was denominated DnmA. Expression of the dnmA gene is downregulated during the developmental cycle. Overall DNA methylation in Dictyostelium is approximately 0.2% of the cytosine residues, which indicates its restriction to a limited set of genomic loci. Bisulfite sequencing of specific sites revealed that DnmA is responsible for methylation of mostly asymmetric C-residues in the retrotransposons DIRS-1 and Skipper. Disruption of the gene resulted in a loss of methylation and in increased transcription and mobilization of Skipper. Skipper transcription was also upregulated in strains that had genes encoding components of the RNA interference pathway disrupted. In contrast, DIRS-1 expression was not affected by a loss of DnmA but was strongly increased in strains that had the RNA-directed RNA polymerase gene rrpC disrupted. A large number of siRNAs were found that corresponded to the DIRS-1 sequence, suggesting concerted regulation of DIRS-1 expression by RNAi and DNA modification. No siRNAs corresponding to the standard Skipper element were found. The data show that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in epigenetic gene silencing in Dictyostelium but that different, partially overlapping mechanisms control transposon silencing.",

However, the role these forces play in controlling cell migration speed remains largely unknown. We used three-dimensional force microscopy to measure the three-dimensional forces exerted by chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells, and examined wild-type cells as well as mutants with defects in contractility, internal F-actin crosslinking, and cortical integrity. We showed that cells pull on their substrate adhesions using two distinct, yet interconnected mechanisms: axial actomyosin contractility and cortical tension. We found that the migration speed increases when axial contractility overcomes cortical tension to produce the cell shape changes needed for locomotion. We demonstrated that the three-dimensional pulling forces generated by both mechanisms are internally balanced by an increase in cytoplasmic pressure that allows cells to push on their substrate without adhering to it, and which may be relevant for amoeboid migration in complex three-dimensional environments.",

In developing structures derived from a null mutant for smdA (a smdA- strain), prestalk patterning is normal, but using a prespore lacZ reporter fusion, there is ectopic accumulation of beta-galactosidase in the prestalk region. As wild type slugs migrate, there is continual forward movement and re-differentiation of prespore cells into prestalk cells. Thus, a potential explanation for the ectopic reporter localization in smdA null prestalk cells is an increased rate of re-differentiation and anterior movement of prespore cells. In support of this notion, analysis of an unstable lacZ reporter, driven by the prespore promoter, reveals a normal staining pattern in the smdA- strain. We suggest that one or more genes regulated by SmdA acts to repress prespore re-specification.",

Little is known about the function of the protein and the cytopathological consequences of the mutations. Disruption of Dictyostelium Ndufaf5 leads to CI deficiency and defects in growth and development. The predicted sequence of Ndufaf5 contains a putative methyltransferase domain. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the methyltransferase motif is essential for its function. Pathological mutations were recreated in the Dictyostelium protein and expressed in the mutant background. These proteins were unable to complement the phenotypes, which further validates Dictyostelium as a model of the disease. Chronic activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed to play a role in Dictyostelium and human cytopathology in mitochondrial diseases. However, inhibition of the expression of AMPK gene in the Ndufaf5-null mutant does not rescue the phenotypes associated with the lack of Ndufaf5, suggesting that novel AMPK-independent pathways are responsible for Ndufaf5 cytopathology. Of interest, the Ndufaf5-deficient strain shows an increase in autophagy. This phenomenon was also observed in a Dictyostelium mutant lacking MidA (C2orf56/PRO1853/Ndufaf7), another CI assembly factor, suggesting that autophagy activation might be a common feature in mitochondrial CI dysfunction.",

Isolated studies have shown that 1) the mevalonate pathway and 2) increased macropinocytosis are important in tumorigenesis, but a connection between these two observations has not been envisioned. A library screen for compounds that selectively killed <i>Dictyostelium pten</i><sup><i>-</i></sup> cells identified pitavastatin. Pitavastatin also killed human breast epithelial MCF10A cells lacking PTEN or expressing K-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>, as well as mouse tumor organoids. The selective killing of cells with oncogenic defects was traced to GGPP (geranylgeranyl diphosphate) depletion. Disruption of GGPP synthase in <i>Dictyostelium</i> revealed that GGPP is needed for pseudopod extension and macropinocytosis. Fluid-phase uptake through macropinocytosis is lower in PTEN-deleted cells and, as reported previously, higher in cells expressing activated Ras. Nevertheless, uptake was more sensitive to pitavastatin in cells with either of these oncogenic mutations than in wild-type cells. Loading the residual macropinosomes after pitavastatin with high concentrations of protein mitigated the cell death, indicating that defective macropinocytosis leads to amino acid starvation. Our studies suggest that the dependence of cancer cells on the mevalonate pathway is due to the role of GGPP in macropinocytosis and the reliance of these cells on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. Thus, inhibition of the networks mediating these processes is likely to be effective in cancer intervention.",

We tested Collage by prioritizing bacterial response genes in Dictyostelium as a novel model system for prokaryote-eukaryote interactions. Using 4 seed genes and 14 data sets, only one of which was directly related to the bacterial response, Collage proposed 8 candidate genes that were readily validated as necessary for the response of Dictyostelium to Gram-negative bacteria.

We compared the pulsing of five housekeeping and five developmentally induced genes by direct imaging of single gene transcriptional events in individual living Dictyostelium cells. Each gene displayed its own transcriptional signature, differing in probability of firing and pulse duration, frequency, and intensity. In contrast to the prevailing view from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that transcription displays binary behavior, strongly expressed housekeeping genes altered the magnitude of their transcriptional pulses during development. These nonbinary \"tunable\" responses may be better suited than stochastic switch behavior for housekeeping functions. Analysis of RNA synthesis kinetics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching implied modulation of housekeeping-gene pulse strength occurs at the level of transcription initiation rather than elongation. In addition, disparities between single cell and population measures of transcript production suggested differences in RNA stability between gene classes. Analysis of stability using RNAseq revealed no major global differences in stability between developmental and housekeeping transcripts, although strongly induced RNAs showed unusually rapid decay, indicating tight regulation of expression.",

These spontaneous expression differences underlie cell fate diversity in both differentiation and disease [2]. The mechanisms responsible for generating expression variability are poorly understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we show that transcript variability emerging during Dictyostelium differentiation is driven predominantly by repression rather than activation. The increased variability of repressed genes was observed over a broad range of expression levels, indicating that variability is actively imposed and not a passive statistical effect of the reduced numbers of molecules accompanying repression. These findings can be explained by a simple model of transcript production, with expression controlled by the frequency, rather than the magnitude, of transcriptional firing events. Our study reveals that the generation of differences between cells can be a direct consequence of the basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.",

The motility of mutant cells in tightly packed tissues in vivo or under strong resistance conditions in vitro was lower than that of wild-type cells, but their motility under low external force conditions was not impaired, indicating inefficient transmission of force in mutant cells. Antibody staining revealed that the talB gene product (talin B) exists as small units subjacent to the cell membrane at adhesion sites without forming large focal adhesion-like assemblies. The total amount of talin B on the cell membrane was larger in prestalk cells, which exert larger force than prespore cells during morphogenesis.

The environmental bacteria replicate intracellularly in free-living amoebae and human alveolar macrophages within a distinct, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived compartment termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). LCV formation requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates into host cells a plethora of different \"effector\" proteins, some of which anchor to the pathogen vacuole by binding to phosphoinositide (PI) lipids. Here, we identified by unbiased pulldown assays in Legionella longbeachae lysates a 111-kDa SidC homologue as the major phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P]-binding protein. The PI-binding domain was mapped to a 20-kDa P4C [PtdIns(4)P binding of SidC] fragment. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that SidC of L. longbeachae (SidC(Llo)) binds PtdIns(4)P with a K(d) (dissociation constant) of 71 nM, which is 3 to 4 times lower than that of the SidC orthologue of Legionella pneumophila (SidC(Lpn)). Upon infection of RAW 264.7 macrophages with L. longbeachae, endogenous SidC(Llo) or ectopically produced SidC(Lpn) localized in an Icm/Dot-dependent manner to the PtdIns(4)P-positive LCVs. An L. longbeachae \u0394sidC deletion mutant was impaired for calnexin recruitment to LCVs in Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae and outcompeted by wild-type bacteria in Acanthamoeba castellanii. Calnexin recruitment was restored by SidC(Llo) or its orthologues SidC(Lpn) and SdcA(Lpn). Conversely, calnexin recruitment was restored by SidC(Llo) in L. pneumophila lacking sidC and sdcA. Together, biochemical, genetic, and cell biological data indicate that SidC(Llo) is an L. longbeachae effector that binds through a P4C domain with high affinity to PtdIns(4)P on LCVs, promotes ER recruitment to the LCV, and thus plays a role in pathogen-host interactions.",

AMPK is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase consisting of a catalytic and two regulatory subunits. As multi-cellular development in <i>Dictyostelium</i> is initiated upon starvation, we explored the role of the energy sensor, AMPK, which shows significant similarity to human AMPK and is expressed throughout development. Deletion of the <i>ampk\u03b1</i> gene results in the formation of numerous small-sized aggregates that develop asynchronously to form few fruiting bodies with small sori and long stalks. On the other hand, <i>ampk\u03b1<sup>OE</sup></i> cells form fruiting bodies with small stalks and large sori when compared with wild-type, Ax2. A minimum of 5% <i>ampk\u03b1<sup>-</sup></i> cells in a chimaera with Ax2 cells was sufficient to reduce the aggregate size. Also, the conditioned media collected from <i>ampk\u03b1<sup>-</sup></i> cells triggered Ax2 cells to form smaller aggregates. The starved <i>ampk\u03b1<sup>-</sup></i> cells showed low glucose levels and formed large aggregates when glucose was supplied exogenously.

It is therefore unclear how long and how frequently a gene is actively transcribed, how this is modulated during differentiation, and how transcriptional events are dynamically coordinated in cell populations. By means of an in vivo RNA detection technique , we have directly visualized transcription of an endogenous developmental gene. We found discrete \"pulses\" of gene activity that turn on and off at irregular intervals. Surprisingly, the length and height of these pulses were consistent throughout development. However, there was strong developmental variation in the proportion of cells recruited to the expressing pool. Cells were more likely to re-express than to initiate new expression, indicating that we directly observe a transcriptional memory. In addition, we used a clustering algorithm to reveal synchronous transcription initiation in neighboring cells. This study represents the first direct visualization of transcriptional pulsing in eukaryotes. Discontinuity of transcription may allow greater flexibility in the gene-expression decisions of a cell.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis of amoeboid cells is driven by actin filaments in leading pseudopodia and actin-myosin filaments in the back and at the side of the cell to suppress pseudopodia. In Dictyostelium, cGMP plays an important role during chemotaxis and is produced predominantly by a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). The sGC protein is enriched in extending pseudopodia at the leading edge of the cell during chemotaxis. We show here that the sGC protein and the cGMP product have different functions during chemotaxis, using two mutants that lose either catalytic activity (sGCDelta cat) or localization to the leading edge (sGCDeltaN). Cells expressing sGCDeltaN exhibit excellent cGMP formation and myosin localization in the back of the cell, but they exhibit poor orientation at the leading edge. Cells expressing the catalytically dead sGCDelta cat mutant show poor myosin localization at the back, but excellent localization of the sGC protein at the leading edge, where it enhances the probability that a new pseudopod is made in proximity to previous pseudopodia, resulting in a decrease of the degree of turning. Thus cGMP suppresses pseudopod formation in the back of the cell, whereas the sGC protein refines pseudopod formation at the leading edge.",

Previous studies indicated a major role of the Dictyostelium homologue of GSK3 (gskA) in cell fate determination during morphogenesis of the fruiting body; however, transcriptomic and proteomic studies have suggested that GSK3 regulates gene expression much earlier during Dictyostelium development. To investigate a potential earlier role of GskA, we examined the effects of loss of gskA on cell aggregation. We find that cells lacking gskA exhibit poor chemotaxis toward cAMP and folate. Mutants fail to activate two important regulatory signaling pathways, mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) and target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2), which in combination are required for chemotaxis and cAMP signaling. These results indicate that GskA is required during early stages of Dictyostelium development, in which it is necessary for both chemotaxis and cell signaling.",

        "abstract": "Cells use signal relay to transmit information across tissue scales. However, the production of information carried by signal relay remains poorly characterised. To determine how the coding features of signal relay are generated, we used the classic system for long-range signalling: the periodic cAMP waves that drive <i>Dictyostelium</i> collective migration. Combining imaging and optogenetic perturbation of cell signalling states, we find that migration is triggered by an increase in wave frequency generated at the signalling centre. Wave frequency is regulated by cAMP wave circulation, which organises the long-range signal. To determine the mechanisms modulating wave circulation, we combined mathematical modelling, the general theory of excitable media, and mechanical perturbations to test competing models. Models in which cell density and spatial patterning modulate the wave frequency cannot explain the temporal evolution of signalling waves. Instead, our evidence leads to a model where wave circulation increases the ability for cells to relay the signal, causing further increase in the circulation rate. This positive feedback between cell state and signalling pattern regulates the long-range signal coding that drives morphogenesis.",

Nonetheless, myosin II-null cells of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium divide efficiently when adhering to substrates by making use of polar traction forces. Here, we show that in the presence of 30 microM blebbistatin, a potent myosin II inhibitor, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells adhering to fibronectin-coated surfaces formed equatorial furrows and divided in a manner strikingly similar to myosin II-null Dictyostelium cells. Such blebbistatin-resistant cytokinesis was absent in partially detached NRK cells and was disrupted in adherent cells if the advance of their polar lamellipodia was disturbed by neighboring cells. Y-27632 (40 microM), which inhibits Rho-kinase, was similar to 30 microM blebbistatin in that it inhibited cytokinesis of partially detached NRK cells but only prolonged furrow ingression in attached cells. In the presence of 100 microM blebbistatin, most NRK cells that initiated anaphase formed tight furrows, although scission never occurred. Adherent HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells also formed equatorial furrows efficiently in the presence of 100 microM blebbistatin. These results provide direct evidence for adhesion-dependent, contractile ring-independent equatorial furrowing in mammalian cells and demonstrate the importance of substrate adhesion for cytokinesis.",

Relatively little is known about chemorepulsion. We previously found that AprA is a chemorepellent protein secreted by Dictyostelium cells. Here we used 29 cell lines with disruptions of cAMP and/or AprA signal transduction pathway components, and delineated the AprA chemorepulsion pathway. We find that AprA uses a subset of chemoattraction signal transduction pathways including Ras, protein kinase A, target of rapamycin (TOR), phospholipase A, and ERK1, but does not require the PI3 kinase/Akt/PKB and guanylyl cyclase pathways to induce chemorepulsion. Possibly as a result of not using the PI3 kinase/Akt/PKB pathway and guanylyl cyclases, AprA does not induce actin polymerization or increase the pseudopod formation rate, but rather appears to inhibit pseudopod formation at the side of cells closest to the source of AprA.",

        "abstract": "After a cell divides into two daughter cells, the total cell surface area of the daughter cells should increase to the original size to maintain cell size homeostasis in a single cell cycle. Previously, three models have been proposed to explain the regulation of cell size homeostasis: sizer, timer, and adder models. Here, we precisely measured the total cell surface area of Dictyostelium cells in a whole cell cycle by using the agar-overlay method, which eliminated the influence of surface membrane reservoirs, such as microvilli and membrane wrinkles. The total cell surface area exponentially increased during interphase, slightly decreased at metaphase, and then increased by approximately 20% during cytokinesis. From the analysis of the added surface area, we concluded that the cell size was regulated by the adder or near-adder model in interphase. This adder model is not caused by a simple cell membrane addition, but is more dynamic due to the rapid cell membrane turnover. We propose a 'dynamic adder model' to explain cell size homeostasis in interphase.",

        "abstract": "Farnesylation involves covalent linkage of eukaryotic proteins to a lipid moiety to anchor them into membranes, which is essential for the biological function of Ras and other proteins. A large cadre of bacterial effectors is injected into host cells by intravacuolar pathogens through elaborate type III-VII translocation machineries, and many of these effectors are incorporated into the pathogen-containing vacuolar membrane by unknown mechanisms. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system of Legionella pneumophila injects into host cells the F-box effector Ankyrin B (AnkB), which functions as platforms for the docking of polyubiquitinated proteins to the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) to enable intravacuolar proliferation in macrophages and amoeba. We show that farnesylation of AnkB is indispensable for its anchoring to the cytosolic face of the LCV membrane, for its biological function within macrophages and Dictyostelium discoideum, and for intrapulmonary proliferation in mice. Remarkably, the protein farnesyltransferase, RCE-1 (Ras-converting enzyme-1), and isoprenyl cysteine carboxyl methyltransferase host farnesylation enzymes are recruited to the LCV in a Dot/Icm-dependent manner and are essential for the biological function of AnkB. In conclusion, this study shows novel localized recruitment of the host farnesylation machinery and its anchoring of an F-box effector to the LCV membrane, and this is essential for biological function in vitro and in vivo.",

Here, by precise microfluidics emulation of dynamic chemoattractant waves, we demonstrate that, in Dictyostelium, directional movement as well as activation of small guanosine triphosphatase Ras at the leading edge is suppressed when the chemoattractant concentration is decreasing over time. This 'rectification' of directional sensing occurs only at an intermediate range of wave speed and does not require phosphoinositide-3-kinase or F-actin. From modelling analysis, we show that rectification arises naturally in a single-layered incoherent feedforward circuit with zero-order ultrasensitivity. The required stimulus time-window predicts ~5\u2009s transient for directional sensing response close to Ras activation and inhibitor diffusion typical for protein in the cytosol. We suggest that the ability of Dictyostelium cells to move only in the wavefront is closely associated with rectification of adaptive response combined with local activation and global inhibition.",

Database searches have yielded 11 Galpha-subunits, a single Gbeta-subunit, but no Ggamma-subunits. We report here the purification, cDNA isolation, and functional analysis of a Ggamma-subunit. Like Gbeta, the Ggamma appears to be unique and hybridization studies show that Ggamma and Gbeta are expressed in parallel during development. Species-wide sequence comparisons of Ggamma-subunits and gamma-like domains of RGS proteins reveal short stretches of highly conserved residues as well as the common CXXL motif at the COOH-terminal of Ggammas that target Gbetagammas to plasma membrane. Overexpression of a CSVL-deleted Ggamma (GgammaDelta) in wild-type cells shifts Gbetagamma to the cytosol and selectively impairs certain G-protein-mediated signal transduction pathways. These cells are able to respond to increments in the stimulus, but are unable to sense chemoattractant gradients. They neither move directionally nor recruit PH-domains to their leading edge. Thus, a full complement of membrane-tethered Gbetagamma is required for sensing shallow gradients, but is not essential for responses to increments in extracellular stimuli.",

Dictyostelium grow as single cells in nutrient-rich media, but, upon nutrient withdrawal, growth ceases and cells enter a program for multi-cell development. While nearly half the genome shows gene expression changes upon nutrient removal, we hypothesized that not all of these genes are required for the switch to program development.

        "abstract": "Cell migration requires a tightly regulated, spatiotemporal coordination of underlying biochemical pathways. Crucial to cell migration is SCAR/WAVE-mediated dendritic F-actin polymerization at the cell's leading edge. Our goal is to understand the role the SCAR/WAVE complex plays in the mechanics of amoeboid migration. To this aim, we measured and compared the traction stresses exerted by Dictyostelium cells lacking the SCAR/WAVE complex proteins PIR121 (pirA(-)) and SCAR (scrA(-)) with those of wild-type cells while they were migrating on flat, elastic substrates. We found that, compared to wild type, both mutant strains exert traction stresses of different strengths that correlate with their F-actin levels. In agreement with previous studies, we found that wild-type cells migrate by repeating a motility cycle in which the cell length and strain energy exerted by the cells on their substrate vary periodically. Our analysis also revealed that scrA(-) cells display an altered motility cycle with a longer period and a lower migration velocity, whereas pirA(-) cells migrate in a random manner without implementing a periodic cycle. We present detailed characterization of the traction-stress phenotypes of the various cell lines, providing new insights into the role of F-actin polymerization in regulating cell-substratum interactions and stresses required for motility.",

        "abstract": "In Dictyostelium, a transient increase in intracellular cGMP is important for cytoskeletal rearrangements during chemotaxis. There must be cGMP-binding proteins in Dictyostelium that regulate key cytoskeletal components after treatment with chemoattractants, but to date, no such proteins have been identified. Using a bioinformatics approach, we have found four candidate cGMP-binding proteins (GbpA-D). GbpA and -B have two tandem cGMP-binding sites downstream of a metallo beta-lactamase domain, a superfamily that includes cAMP phosphodiesterases. GbpC contains the following nine domains (in order): leucine-rich repeats, Ras, MEK kinase, Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor N-terminal (RasGEF-N), DEP, RasGEF, cGMP-binding, GRAM, and a second cGMP-binding domain. GbpD is related to GbpC, but is much shorter; it begins with the RasGEF-N domain, and lacks the DEP domain. Disruption of the gbpC gene results in loss of all high-affinity cGMP-binding activity present in the soluble cellular fraction. GbpC mRNA levels increase dramatically 8 h after starvation is initiated. GbpA, -B, and -D mRNA levels show less dramatic changes, with gbpA mRNA levels highest 4 h into starvation, gbpB mRNA levels highest in vegetative cells, and gbpD levels highest at 8 h. The identification of these genes is the first step in a molecular approach to studying downstream effects of cGMP signaling in Dictyostelium.",

Two opposing models have been proposed to explain Lyst function. The fission model describes Lyst as a positive regulator of fission from lysosomal compartments, whereas the fusion model identifies Lyst as a negative regulator of fusion between lysosomal vesicles. Here, we used assays that can distinguish between defects in vesicle fusion versus fission. We compared the phenotype of Dictyostelium discoideum cells defective in LvsB, the ortholog of Lyst, with that of two known fission defect mutants (\u03bc3- and WASH-null mutants). We found that the temporal localization characteristics of the post-lysosomal marker vacuolin, as well as vesicular acidity and the fusion dynamics of LvsB-null cells are distinct from those of both \u03bc3- and WASH-null fission defect mutants. These distinctions are predicted by the fusion defect model and implicate LvsB as a negative regulator of vesicle fusion.",

Amino acids 756-1148 of the 2110 amino acids are sufficient for centrosomal targeting and cell cycle-dependent centrosome association. Mutant cells lacking CP250 are smaller in size, growth on bacteria is delayed, chemotaxis is altered, and development is affected, which, in general, are defects observed in cytoskeletal mutants. Furthermore, loss of CP250 affected the nuclear envelope and led to reduced amounts and altered distribution of Sun-1, a conserved nuclear envelope protein that connects the centrosome to chromatin.",

A signaling pathway acting through PIP(3), which accumulates at the leading edge of the cell, has been extensively characterized. However, chemotaxis still remains in cells depleted of PIP(3), suggesting there are PIP(3)-independent pathways. We have identified a pathway involving TorC2-PKBR1 as well as another containing PLA2 activity that act in parallel with PIP(3). Activation of PKBR1, a myristoylated Protein Kinase B homolog, is dependent on TorC2 (Rapamycin-insensitive Tor complex 2) kinase but is completely independent of PIP(3). In response to chemoattractant, PKBs rapidly phosphorylate at least eight proteins, including Talin B, PI4P 5-kinase, two RasGefs, and a RhoGap. These studies help to link the signaling pathways to specific effectors and provide a more complete understanding of chemotaxis.",

        "title": "Computational modeling reveals that a combination of chemotaxis and differential adhesion leads to robust cell sorting during tissue patterning.",
        "abstract": "Robust tissue patterning is crucial to many processes during development. The \"French Flag\" model of patterning, whereby na\u00efve cells in a gradient of diffusible morphogen signal adopt different fates due to exposure to different amounts of morphogen concentration, has been the most widely proposed model for tissue patterning. However, recently, using time-lapse experiments, cell sorting has been found to be an alternative model for tissue patterning in the zebrafish neural tube. But it remains unclear what the sorting mechanism is. In this article, we used computational modeling to show that two mechanisms, chemotaxis and differential adhesion, are needed for robust cell sorting. We assessed the performance of each of the two mechanisms by quantifying the fraction of correct sorting, the fraction of stable clusters formed after correct sorting, the time needed to achieve correct sorting, and the size variations of the cells having different fates. We found that chemotaxis and differential adhesion confer different advantages to the sorting process. Chemotaxis leads to high fraction of correct sorting as individual cells will either migrate towards or away from the source depending on its cell type. However after the cells have sorted correctly, there is no interaction among cells of the same type to stabilize the sorted boundaries, leading to cell clusters that are unstable. On the other hand, differential adhesion results in low fraction of correct clusters that are more stable. In the absence of morphogen gradient noise, a combination of both chemotaxis and differential adhesion yields cell sorting that is both accurate and robust. However, in the presence of gradient noise, the simple combination of chemotaxis and differential adhesion is insufficient for cell sorting; instead, chemotaxis coupled with delayed differential adhesion is required to yield optimal sorting.",

The reusable monolithic glass devices have integral ports that can generate multiple gradients in a single experiment. We also used cover slip microfluidics for chemotaxis assays. Passive gradients elicited from these cover slips could be readily adapted for high throughput chemotaxis assays.We have also demonstrated for the first time that cells can be recruited into cover slip ports eliciting passive chemoattractant gradients. This proves, in principle, that intravital cover slip configurations could deliver controlled amounts of drugs, chemicals, or pathogens as well as recruit cells for proteomic or histological analysis in living animals while under microscopic observation.

To understand how cells cope with heterogeneous environments we have investigated the pseudopod life cycle of wild type and mutant cells moving on a substrate and when suspended in liquid. We show that the same pseudopod cycle can provide three types of movement that we address as walking, gliding and swimming. In walking, the extending pseudopod will adhere firmly to the substrate, which allows cells to generate forces to bypass obstacles. Mutant cells with compromised adhesion can move much faster than wild type cells on a smooth substrate (gliding), but cannot move effectively against obstacles that provide resistance. In a liquid, when swimming, the extending pseudopods convert to side-bumps that move rapidly to the rear of the cells. Calculations suggest that these bumps provide sufficient drag force to mediate the observed forward swimming of the cell.",

However, later studies refuted a functional role of intracellular P2X receptors in Dictyostelium. Here we provide evidence that the discrepancies reported between the studies are due to the laboratory strain of Dictyostelium employed, which display different phenotypes in response to hypotonic stress and a varied dependency upon P2X receptors for osmoregulation. We use the recent discovery that intracellular P2X receptors are novel calcium release channels to provide some mechanistic insight in an effort to explain why the strain variance may exist.",

Information regarding the signaling function of extracellular ATP in single-celled eukaryotes is lacking. Here, we explore the role of extracellular ATP in cell volume recovery during osmotic swelling in the amoeba Dictyostelium. Release of micromolar ATP could be detected during cell swelling and regulatory cell volume decrease (RVD) phases during hypotonic challenge. Scavenging ATP with apyrase caused profound cell swelling and loss of RVD. Apyrase-induced swelling could be rescued by 100 \u03bcM \u03b2\u03b3-imidoATP. N-Ethylmalemide (NEM), an inhibitor of vesicular exocytosis, caused heightened cell swelling, loss of RVD, and inhibition of ATP release. Amoebas with impaired contractile vacuole (CV) fusion (drainin knockout [KO] cells) displayed increased swelling but intact ATP release. One hundred micromolar Gd(3+) caused cell swelling while blocking any recovery by \u03b2\u03b3-imidoATP. ATP release was 4-fold higher in the presence of Gd(3+). Cell swelling was associated with an increase in intracellular nitric oxide (NO), with NO-scavenging agents causing cell swelling. Swelling-induced NO production was inhibited by both apyrase and Gd(3+), while NO donors rescued apyrase- and Gd(3+)-induced swelling. These data suggest extracellular ATP released during cell swelling is an important signal that elicits RVD. Though the cell surface receptor for ATP in Dictyostelium remains elusive, we suggest ATP operates through a Gd(3+)-sensitive receptor that is coupled with intracellular NO production.",

Skp1 is an adapter in the Skp1/cullin1/F-box protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that targets specific proteins for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. To investigate the biochemical consequences of glycosylation, untagged full-length Skp1 and several of its posttranslationally modified isoforms were expressed and purified to near homogeneity using recombinant and in vitro strategies. Interaction studies with the soluble mammalian F-box protein Fbs1/Fbg1/OCP1 revealed preferential binding to the glycosylated isoforms of Skp1. This difference correlated with the increased \u03b1-helical and decreased \u03b2-sheet content of glycosylated Skp1s based on circular dichroism and increased folding order based on small-angle X-ray scattering. A comparison of the molecular envelopes of fully glycosylated Skp1 and the apoprotein indicated that both isoforms exist as an antiparallel dimer that is more compact and extended in the glycosylated state. Analytical gel filtration and chemical cross-linking studies showed a growing tendency of less modified isoforms to dimerize. Considering that regions of free Skp1 are intrinsically disordered and Skp1 can adopt distinct folds when bound to F-box proteins, we propose that glycosylation, which occurs adjacent to the F-box binding site, influences the spectrum of energetically similar conformations that vary inversely in their propensity to dock with Fbs1 or another Skp1. Glycosylation may thus influence Skp1 function by modulating F-box protein binding in cells.",

Migrating cells maintain dynamic complementary distributions of Ras activity and of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). Here, we show that lagging-edge component PI(3,4)P2 also localizes to retracting leading-edge protrusions and nascent macropinosomes, even in the absence of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Once internalized, macropinosomes break up into smaller PI(3,4)P2-enriched vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane at the rear of the cell. Subsequently, the phosphoinositide diffuses toward the front of the cell, where it is degraded. Computational modeling confirms that this cycle gives rise to stable back-to-front gradient.

        "abstract": "STATc becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus when Dictyostelium cells are exposed to the prestalk cell inducer Differentiation inducing factor 1 (DIF-1), or are subjected to hyper-osmotic stress. We show that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP3 interacts directly with STATc and that STATc is refractory to activation in PTP3 overexpressing cells. Conversely, overexpression of a dominant inhibitor of PTP3 leads to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and ectopic nuclear localisation of STATc. Treatment of cells with DIF-1 or exposure to hyper-osmotic stress induces a decrease in biochemically assayable PTP3 activity and both agents also induce serine-threonine phosphorylation of PTP3. These observations suggest a novel mode of STAT activation, whereby serine-threonine phosphorylation of a cognate protein tyrosine phosphatase results in the inhibition of its activity, shifting the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation equilibrium in favour of phosphorylation.",

        "abstract": "Blebbistatin, a cell-permeable inhibitor of class-II myosins, was developed to provide a tool for studying the biologic roles of myosin II. Consistent with this use, we find that blebbistatin inhibits three myosin II-dependent processes in Dictyostelium (growth in suspension culture, capping of Con A receptors, and development to fruiting bodies) and does not inhibit growth on plates, which does not require myosin II. As expected, macropinocytosis (myosin I-dependent), contractile vacuole activity (myosin V-dependent), and phagocytosis (myosin VII-dependent), none of which requires myosin II, are not inhibited by blebbistatin in myosin II-null cells, but, unexpectedly, blebbistatin does inhibit macropinocytosis and phagocytosis by cells expressing myosin II. Expression of catalytically inactive myosin II in myosin II-null cells also inhibits macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. Both blebbistatin-inhibited myosin II and catalytically inactive myosin II form cytoplasmic aggregates, which may be why they inhibit myosin II-independent processes, but neither affects the distribution of actin filaments in vegetative cells or actin and myosin distribution in dividing or polarized cells. Blebbistatin also inhibits cell streaming and plaque expansion in myosin II-null cells. Our results are consistent with myosin II being the only Dictyostelium myosin that is inhibited by blebbistatin but also show that blebbistatin-inactivated myosin II inhibits some myosin II-independent processes and that blebbistatin inhibits other activities in the absence of myosin II.",

        "abstract": "At the leading edge of a motile cell, actin polymerizes in close apposition to the plasma membrane. Here we ask how the machinery for force generation at a leading edge is established de novo after the global depolymerization of actin. The depolymerization is accomplished by latrunculin A, and the reorganization of actin upon removal of the drug is visualized in Dictyostelium cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The actin filament system is reorganized in three steps. First, F-actin assembles into globular complexes that move along the bottom surface of the cells at velocities up to 10 microm/min. These clusters are transient structures that eventually disassemble, fuse, or divide. In a second step, clusters merge into a contiguous zone at the cell border that spreads and gives rise to actin waves traveling on a planar membrane. Finally, normal cell shape and motility are resumed. These data show that the initiation of actin polymerization is separated in Dictyostelium from front protrusion, and that the coupling of polymerization to protrusion is a later step in the reconstitution of a leading edge.",

Higher eukaryotes express repeated copies of three closely related H3 variants, inaccessible to genetic analysis. We demonstrate conservation of these phenomena in Dictyostelium which has three single-copy H3 variant genes. Although dynamic acetylation is targeted to two H3 variants which are K4-trimethylated, K9-acetylation is preferentially targeted to one. In cells lacking Set1 methyltransferase and any detectable K4-trimethylation, dynamic acetylation is lost demonstrating a direct link between the two. Gene replacement to express mutated H3 variants reveals a novel interaction between K4-trimethylation on different variants. Cells expressing only one variant show defects in growth, and in induction of a UV-inducible gene, demonstrating the functional importance of variant expression. These studies confirm that dynamic acetylation targeted to H3K4me3 arose early in evolution and reveal a very high level of specificity of histone variant utilization in a simple multicellular eukaryote.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar mood disorder (manic depression) is a major psychiatric disorder whose molecular origins are unknown. Mood stabilisers offer patients both acute and prophylactic treatment, and experimentally, they provide a means to probe the underlying biology of the disorder. Lithium and other mood stabilisers deplete intracellular inositol and it has been proposed that bipolar mood disorder arises from aberrant inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate [IP(3), also known as Ins(1,4,5)P(3)] signalling. However, there is no definitive evidence to support this or any other proposed target; a problem exacerbated by a lack of good cellular models. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PIP(3), also known as PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] is a prominent intracellular signal molecule within the central nervous system (CNS) that regulates neuronal survival, connectivity and synaptic function. By using the genetically tractable organism Dictyostelium, we show that lithium suppresses PIP(3)-mediated signalling. These effects extend to the human neutrophil cell line HL60. Mechanistically, we show that lithium attenuates phosphoinositide synthesis and that its effects can be reversed by overexpression of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), consistent with the inositol-depletion hypothesis. These results demonstrate a lithium target that is compatible with our current knowledge of the genetic predisposition for bipolar disorder. They also suggest that lithium therapy might be beneficial for other diseases caused by elevated PIP(3) signalling.",

Despite these universal functions, lamins have so far been found only in metazoans. We have identified protein NE81 in Dictyostelium, which has properties that justify its denomination as a lamin-like protein in a lower eukaryote. This is based on its primary structure, subcellular localization, and regulation during mitosis, and its requirement of the C-terminal CaaX box as a posttranslational processing signal for proper localization. Our knockout and overexpression mutants revealed an important role for NE81 in nuclear integrity, chromatin organization, and mechanical stability of cells. All our results are in agreement with a role for NE81 in formation of a nuclear lamina. This function is corroborated by localization of Dictyostelium NE81 at the nuclear envelope in human cells. The discovery of a lamin-like protein in a unicellular organism is not only intriguing in light of evolution, it may also provide a simple experimental platform for studies of the molecular basis of laminopathies.",

Although much emphasis has been placed on cell-adhesion complexes as force sensors, the forces must nevertheless be transmitted through the cortical cytoskeleton. Yet how the actin cortex senses and transmits forces and how cytoskeletal proteins interact in response to the forces is poorly understood. Here, by combining molecular and mechanical experimental perturbations with theoretical multiscale modelling, we decipher cortical mechanosensing from molecular to cellular scales. We show that forces are shared between myosin II and different actin crosslinkers, with myosin having potentiating or inhibitory effects on certain crosslinkers. Different types of cell deformation elicit distinct responses, with myosin and \u03b1-actinin responding to dilation, and filamin mainly reacting to shear. Our observations show that the accumulation kinetics of each protein may be explained by its molecular mechanisms, and that protein accumulation and the cell's viscoelastic state can explain cell contraction against mechanical load.",

        "abstract": "Hirano bodies are actin-rich inclusions reported most frequently in the hippocampus in association with a variety of conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. We have developed a model system for formation of Hirano bodies in Dictyostelium and cultured mammalian cells to permit detailed studies of the dynamics of these structures in living cells. Model Hirano bodies are frequently observed in membrane-enclosed vesicles in mammalian cells consistent with a role of autophagy in the degradation of these structures. Clearance of Hirano bodies by an exocytotic process is supported by images from electron microscopy showing extracellular release of Hirano bodies, and observation of Hirano bodies in the culture medium of Dictyostelium and mammalian cells. An autophagosome marker protein Atg8-GFP, was co-localized with model Hirano bodies in wild type Dictyostelium cells, but not in atg5(-) or atg1-1 autophagy mutant strains. Induction of model Hirano bodies in Dictyostelium with a high level expression of 34 kDa DeltaEF1 from the inducible discoidin promoter resulted in larger Hirano bodies and a cessation of cell doubling. The degradation of model Hirano bodies still occurred rapidly in autophagy mutant (atg5(-)) Dictyostelium, suggesting that other mechanisms such as the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway could contribute to the degradation of Hirano bodies. Chemical inhibition of the proteasome pathway with lactacystin, significantly decreased the turnover of Hirano bodies in Dictyostelium providing direct evidence that autophagy and the proteasome can both contribute to degradation of Hirano bodies. Short term treatment of mammalian cells with either lactacystin or 3-methyl adenine results in higher levels of Hirano bodies and a lower level of viable cells in the cultures, supporting the conclusion that both autophagy and the proteasome contribute to degradation of Hirano bodies.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis of bacteria requires regulated methylation of chemoreceptors. However, despite considerable effort in the 1980s, transmethylation has never been established as a component of eukaryotic cell chemotaxis. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the product formed when the methyl group of the universal donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is transferred to an acceptor molecule, is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation reactions. In eukaryotic cells, this inhibition is relieved by hydrolysis of SAH to adenosine and homocysteine catalyzed by SAH hydrolase (SAHH). We now report that SAHH, which is diffuse in the cytoplasm of nonmotile Dictyostelium amoebae and human neutrophils, concentrates with F-actin in pseudopods at the front of motile, chemotaxing cells, but is not present in filopodia or at the very leading edge. Tubercidin, an inhibitor of SAHH, inhibits both chemotaxis and chemotaxis-dependent cell streaming of Dictyostelium, and chemotaxis of neutrophils at concentrations that have little effect on cell viability. Tubercidin does not inhibit starvation-induced expression of the cAMP receptor, cAR1, or G protein-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and actin polymerization in Dictyostelium. Tubercidin has no effect on either capping of Con A receptors or phagocytosis in Dictyostelium. These results add SAHH to the list of proteins that redistribute in response to chemotactic signals in Dictyostelium and neutrophils and strongly suggest a role for transmethylation in chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells.",

To investigate how migrating cells detect and respond to mechanical forces, we used a \"cell squasher\" to apply uniaxial pressure to <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells chemotaxing under soft agarose. As little as 100 Pa causes a rapid (<10 s), sustained shift to movement with blebs rather than pseudopods. Cells are flattened under load and lose volume; the actin cytoskeleton is reorganized, with myosin II recruited to the cortex, which may pressurize the cytoplasm for blebbing. The transition to bleb-driven motility requires extracellular calcium and is accompanied by increased cytosolic calcium. It is largely abrogated in cells lacking the Piezo stretch-operated channel; under load, these cells persist in using pseudopods and chemotax poorly. We propose that migrating cells sense pressure through Piezo, which mediates calcium influx, directing movement with blebs instead of pseudopods.",

        "abstract": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective calcium channel distributed broadly across eukaryotes but absent in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The molecular components of the human uniporter holocomplex (uniplex) have been identified recently. The uniplex consists of three membrane-spanning subunits--mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), its paralog MCUb, and essential MCU regulator (EMRE)--and two soluble regulatory components--MICU1 and its paralog MICU2. The minimal components sufficient for in vivo uniporter activity are unknown. Here we consider Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), a member of the Amoebazoa outgroup of Metazoa and Fungi, and show that it has a highly simplified uniporter machinery. We show that D. discoideum mitochondria exhibit membrane potential-dependent calcium uptake compatible with uniporter activity, and also that expression of DdMCU complements the mitochondrial calcium uptake defect in human cells lacking MCU or EMRE. Moreover, expression of DdMCU in yeast alone is sufficient to reconstitute mitochondrial calcium uniporter activity. Having established yeast as an in vivo reconstitution system, we then reconstituted the human uniporter. We show that coexpression of MCU and EMRE is sufficient for uniporter activity, whereas expression of MCU alone is insufficient. Our work establishes yeast as a powerful in vivo reconstitution system for the uniporter. Using this system, we confirm that MCU is the pore-forming subunit, define the minimal genetic elements sufficient for metazoan and nonmetazoan uniporter activity, and provide valuable insight into the evolution of the uniporter machinery.",

        "abstract": "Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the mechanochemical cycle of myosin motors are essential for understanding the mechanism of energy conversion. Here, we report our investigation of temperature and free Mg(2+)-ion dependencies of sliding velocities of a high duty ratio class-5 myosin motor, myosin-5b from D. discoideum using in vitro motility assays. Previous studies have shown that the sliding velocity of class-5 myosins obeys modulation by free Mg(2+)-ions. Free Mg(2+)-ions affect ADP release kinetics and the dwell time of actin-attached states. The latter determines the maximal velocity of actin translocation in the sliding filament assay. We measured the temperature dependence of sliding velocity in the range from 5 to 55\u00b0C at two limiting free Mg(2+)-ion concentrations. Arrhenius plots demonstrated non-linear behavior. Based on this observation we propose a kinetic model, which explains both sensitivity towards free Mg(2+)-ions and non-linearity of the temperature dependence of sliding velocity. According to this model, velocity is represented as a simple analytical function of temperature and free Mg(2+)-ion concentrations. This function has been applied to global non-linear fit analysis of three data sets including temperature and magnesium (at 20\u00b0C) dependence of sliding velocity. As a result we obtain thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H(Mg) and \u0394S(Mg)) of a fast equilibrium between magnesium free (AM\u00b7D) and magnesium bound acto-myosin-ADP (AM\u00b7 Mg(2+)D) states and the corresponding enthalpic barriers associated with ADP release (\u0394H1(\u2021) and \u0394H2(\u2021)). The herein presented integrative approach of data analysis based on global fitting can be applied to the remaining steps of the acto-myosin ATPase cycle facilitating the determination of energetic parameters and thermodynamics of acto-myosin interactions.",

        "abstract": "Cellular adaptation to changes in environmental osmolarity is crucial for cell survival. In Dictyostelium, STATc is a key regulator of the transcriptional response to hyperosmotic stress. Its phosphorylation and consequent activation is controlled by two signaling branches, one cGMP- and the other Ca(2+)-dependent, of which many signaling components have yet to be identified. The STATc stress signalling pathway feeds back on itself by upregulating the expression of STATc and STATc-regulated genes. Based on microarray studies we chose two tyrosine-kinase like proteins, Pyk3 and Phg2, as possible modulators of STATc phosphorylation and generated single and double knock-out mutants to them. Transcriptional regulation of STATc and STATc dependent genes was disturbed in pyk3(-), phg2(-), and pyk3(-)/phg2(-) cells. The absence of Pyk3 and/or Phg2 resulted in diminished or completely abolished increased transcription of STATc dependent genes in response to sorbitol, 8-Br-cGMP and the Ca(2+) liberator BHQ. Also, phospho-STATc levels were significantly reduced in pyk3(-) and phg2(-) cells and even further decreased in pyk3(-)/phg2(-) cells. The reduced phosphorylation was mirrored by a significant delay in nuclear translocation of GFP-STATc. The protein tyrosine phosphatase 3 (PTP3), which dephosphorylates and inhibits STATc, is inhibited by stress-induced phosphorylation on S448 and S747. Use of phosphoserine specific antibodies showed that Phg2 but not Pyk3 is involved in the phosphorylation of PTP3 on S747. In pull-down assays Phg2 and PTP3 interact directly, suggesting that Phg2 phosphorylates PTP3 on S747 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S448 was unchanged in phg2(-) cells. We show that Phg2 and an, as yet unknown, S448 protein kinase are responsible for PTP3 phosphorylation and hence its inhibition, and that Pyk3 is involved in the regulation of STATc by either directly or indirectly activating it. Our results add further complexities to the regulation of STATc, which presumably ensure its optimal activation in response to different environmental cues.",

        "abstract": "The polyketide DIF-1 induces Dictyostelium amoebae to form stalk cells in culture. To better define its role in normal development, we examined the phenotype of a mutant blocking the first step of DIF-1 synthesis, which lacks both DIF-1 and its biosynthetic intermediate, dM-DIF-1 (des-methyl-DIF-1). Slugs of this polyketide synthase mutant (stlB(-)) are long and thin and rapidly break up, leaving an immotile prespore mass. They have approximately 30% fewer prestalk cells than their wild-type parent and lack a subset of anterior-like cells, which later form the outer basal disc. This structure is missing from the fruiting body, which perhaps in consequence initiates culmination along the substratum. The lower cup is rudimentary at best and the spore mass, lacking support, slips down the stalk. The dmtA(-) methyltransferase mutant, blocked in the last step of DIF-1 synthesis, resembles the stlB(-) mutant but has delayed tip formation and fewer prestalk-O cells. This difference may be due to accumulation of dM-DIF-1 in the dmtA(-) mutant, since dM-DIF-1 inhibits prestalk-O differentiation. Thus, DIF-1 is required for slug migration and specifies the anterior-like cells forming the basal disc and much of the lower cup; significantly the DIF-1 biosynthetic pathway may supply a second signal - dM-DIF-1.",

        "abstract": "Switching between attractive and repulsive migration in cell movement in response to extracellular guidance cues has been found in various cell types and is an important cellular function for translocation during cellular and developmental processes. Here we show that the preferential direction of migration during electrotaxis in Dictyostelium cells can be reversed by genetically modulating both guanylyl cyclases (GCases) and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-binding protein C (GbpC) in combination with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases (PI3Ks). The PI3K-dependent pathway is involved in cathode-directed migration under a direct-current electric field. The catalytic domains of soluble GCase (sGC) and GbpC also mediate cathode-directed signaling via cGMP, whereas the N-terminal domain of sGC mediates anode-directed signaling in conjunction with both the inhibition of PI3Ks and cGMP production. These observations provide an identification of the genes required for directional switching in electrotaxis and suggest that a parallel processing of electric signals, in which multiple-signaling pathways act to bias cell movement toward the cathode or anode, is used to determine the direction of migration.",

We have found that Dictyostelium has a gene, mfeA, encoding MFE1 with homology to the hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and SCP2 domains. A separate gene, mfeB, encodes MFE2 with homology to the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain. When grown on a diet of bacteria, Dictyostelium cells in which mfeA is disrupted accumulate excess cyclopropane fatty acids and are unable to develop beyond early aggregation. Axenically grown mutant cells, however, developed into normal fruiting bodies composed of spores and stalk cells. Comparative analysis of whole-cell lipid compositions revealed that bacterially grown mutant cells accumulated cyclopropane fatty acids that remained throughout the developmental stages. Such a persistent accumulation was not detected in wild-type cells or axenically grown mutant cells. Bacterial phosphatidylethanolamine that contains abundant cyclopropane fatty acids inhibited the development of even axenically grown mutant cells, while dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine did not. These results suggest that MFE1 protects the cells from the increase of the harmful xenobiotic fatty acids incorporated from their diets and optimizes cellular lipid composition for proper development. Hence, we propose that this enzyme plays an irreplaceable role in the survival strategy of Dictyostelium cells to form spores for their efficient dispersal in nature.",

We show here that c-di-GMP was not sufficient to induce cell death in Dictyostelium cell monolayers. Unexpectedly, it also required the DIF-1 polyketide. The latter could be exogenous, as revealed by a telling synergy between c-di-GMP and DIF-1. The required DIF-1 polyketide could also be endogenous, as shown by the inability of c-di-GMP to induce cell death in Dictyostelium HMX44A cells and DH1 cells upon pharmacological or genetic inhibition of DIF-1 biosynthesis. In these cases, c-di-GMP-induced cell death was rescued by complementation with exogenous DIF-1. Taken together, these results demonstrated that c-di-GMP could trigger cell death in Dictyostelium only in the presence of the DIF-1 polyketide or its metabolites. This identified another element of control to this cell death and perhaps also to c-di-GMP effects in other situations and organisms.",

A number of proteins, including a complex containing Nap1, PIR121, Abi1/2, and HSPC300, interact with Scar/WAVE, though the role of this complex in regulating Scar function remains unclear. Here we identify a short N-terminal region of Dictyostelium Scar that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with HSPC300 and Abi in vitro. Cells expressing Scar lacking this N-terminal region show abnormalities in F-actin distribution, cell morphology, movement, and cytokinesis. This is true even in the presence of wild-type Scar. The data suggest that the first 96 amino acids of Scar are necessary for participation in a large-molecular-weight protein complex, and that this Scar-containing complex is responsible for the proper localization and regulation of Scar. The presence of mis-regulated or unregulated Scar has significant deleterious effects on cells and may explain the need to keep Scar activity tightly controlled in vivo either by assembly in a complex or by rapid degradation.",

We use a septase (sepA)-null mutant with delayed cytokinesis to show that in anaphase a pattern is generated in the cell cortex of cortexillin and myosin II. In multi-nucleate cells, these proteins decorate the entire cell cortex except circular zones around the centrosomes. Unilateral cleavage furrows are initiated at spaces free of microtubule asters and invade the cells along trails of cortexillin and myosin II accumulation. Where these areas widen, the cleavage furrow may branch or expand. When two furrows meet, they fuse, thus separating portions of the multi-nucleate cell from each other. Unilateral furrows are distinguished from the contractile ring of a normal furrow by their expansion rather than constriction. This is particularly evident for expanding ring-shaped furrows that are formed in the centre of a large multi-nucleate cell. Our data suggest that the myosin II-enriched area in multi-nucleate cells is a contractile sheet that pulls on the unilateral furrows and, in that way, expands them.",

All these modes have been mainly investigated using cells adhering to the substratum although they can grow in shaking suspension culture. Here, we observed how cells divide without adhering to the substratum using a new non-adhesive material. These detached cells formed the cleavage furrow but eventually failed in the final abscission. Thus, the cells cannot divide without adhesion, suggesting that they cannot divide only through the conventional cytokinesis A. However, in a long-term culture, the detached cells adhered each other to form multicellular aggregates and divided properly in these aggregates. Myosin II-null cells also formed such aggregates but could not divide in the aggregates. Several lines of experiments using mutant cells showed that the process of cytokinesis in multicellular aggregates is a novel mode utilizing a confined space in the aggregate in a myosin II-dependent manner. These results shed light on a poorly characterized mechanism of cytokinesis in multicellular spheroids or tissues. We propose to redefine and classify multiple modes of cytokinesis.",

        "abstract": "Thus far, 14 homologues of mammalian Rac proteins have been identified in Dictyostelium. It is unclear whether each of these genes has a unique function or to what extent they play redundant roles in actin cytoskeletal organization. To investigate the specific function of RacB, we have conditionally expressed wild-type (WT-RacB), dominant negative (N17-RacB), and constitutively activated (V12-RacB) versions of the protein. On induction, cells expressing V12-RacB stopped growing, detached from the surface, and formed numerous spherical surface protrusions while cells overexpressing WT-RacB became flattened on the surface. In contrast, cells overexpressing N17-RacB did not show any significant morphological abnormalities. The surface protrusions seen in V12-RacB cells appear to be actin-driven protrusions because they were enriched in F-actin and were inhibitable by cytochalasin A treatment. The protrusions in V12-RacB cells did not require myosin II activity, which distinguishes them from blebs formed by wild-type cells under stress. Finally, we examined the functional consequences of expression of wild-type and mutant RacB. Phagocytosis, endocytosis, and fluid phase efflux rates were reduced in all cell lines expressing RacB proteins but the greatest decrease was observed for cells expressing V12-RacB. From these results, we conclude that like other members of the Rho family, RacB induces polymerization of actin but the consequences of activation appear to be different from other Dictyostelium Rac proteins so far investigated, resulting in different morphological and functional changes in cells.",

Here, by employing deep-learning-based feature extraction combined with phase-field modeling framework, we show that a low dimensional feature space for 2D migrating cell morphologies obtained from the shape stereotype of keratocytes, Dictyostelium and neutrophils can be fully mapped by an interlinked signaling network of cell-polarization and protrusion dynamics.

The perturbations at these key nodes of an excitable signal transduction network initiated a causal chain of events: the threshold for network activation was lowered, the speed and range of propagating waves of signal transduction activity increased, actin-driven cellular protrusions expanded and, consequently, the cell migratory mode transitions ensued. Conversely, innately keratocyte-like and oscillatory cells were promptly converted to amoeboid by inhibition of Ras effectors with restoration of directed migration. We use computational analysis to explain how thresholds control cell migration and discuss the architecture of the signal transduction network that gives rise to excitability.",

Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which Rap1 controls actin cytoskeletal reorganization in Dictyostelium and found that Rap1 interacts with RacGEF1 in vitro and stimulates F-actin polymerization at the sites where Rap1 is activated upon chemoattractant stimulation. Live cell imaging using GFP-coronin, a reporter for F-actin, demonstrates that cells expressing constitutively active Rap1 (Rap1CA) exhibit a high level of F-actin uniformly distributed at the cortex including the posterior and lateral sides of the chemotaxing cell. Examination of the localization of a PH-domain containing PIP3 reporter, PhdA-GFP, and the activation of Akt/Pkb and other Ras proteins in Rap1CA cells reveals that activated Rap1 has no effect on the production of PIP3 or the activation of Akt/Pkb and Ras proteins in response to chemoattractant stimulation. Rac family proteins are crucial regulators in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. In vitro binding assay using truncated RacGEF1 proteins shows that Rap1 interacts with the DH domain of RacGEF1. Taken together, these results suggest that Rap1-mediated F-actin polymerization probably occurs through the Rac signaling pathway by directly binding to RacGEF1.",

        "abstract": "The second messenger molecule cAMP regulates the activation phase of the cAMP signaling pathway through high-affinity interactions with the cytosolic cAMP receptor, the protein kinase A regulatory subunit (PKAR). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are enzymes responsible for catalyzing hydrolysis of cAMP to 5' AMP. It was recently shown that PDEs interact with PKAR to initiate the termination phase of the cAMP signaling pathway. While the steps in the activation phase are well understood, steps in the termination pathway are unknown. Specifically, the binding and allosteric networks that regulate the dynamic interplay between PKAR, PDE, and cAMP are unclear. In this study, PKAR and PDE from Dictyostelium discoideum (RD and RegA, respectively) were used as a model system to monitor complex formation in the presence and absence of cAMP. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to monitor slow conformational transitions in RD, using disordered regions as conformational probes. Our results reveal that RD regulates its interactions with cAMP and RegA at distinct loci by undergoing slow conformational transitions between two metastable states. In the presence of cAMP, RD and RegA form a stable ternary complex, while in the absence of cAMP they maintain transient interactions. RegA and cAMP each bind at orthogonal sites on RD with resultant contrasting effects on its dynamics through parallel allosteric relays at multiple important loci. RD thus serves as an integrative node in cAMP termination by coordinating multiple allosteric relays and governing the output signal response.",

        "abstract": "We have identified a novel gene, dwwA, which is required for cytokinesis of Dictyostelium cells on solid surfaces. Its product, Dd WW domain containing protein A (DWWA), contains several motifs, including two WW domains, an IQ motif, a C2 domain, and a proline-rich region. On substrates, cells lacking dwwA were multinucleated and larger and flatter than wild-type cells due to their frequent inability to sever the cytoplasmic bridge connecting daughter cells after mitosis. When cultured in suspension, however, dwwA-null cells seemed to carry out cytokinesis normally via a process not driven by the shearing force arising from agitation of the culture. GFP-DWWA localized to the cell cortex and nucleus; analysis of the distributions of various truncation mutants revealed that the N-terminal half of the protein, which contains the C2 domain, is required for the cortical localization of DWWA. The IQ motif of DWWA binds calmodulin in vitro. Given that the scission process is also defective in calmodulin knockdown cells cultured on substrates (Liu et al., 1992), we propose that DWWA's multiple binding domains enable it to function as an adaptor protein, facilitating the scission process through the regulation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and/or modulation of membrane dynamics.",

        "abstract": "A type VI secretion system (T6SS) was recently shown to be required for full virulence of Vibrio cholerae O37 serogroup strain V52. In this study, we systematically mutagenized each individual gene in T6SS locus and characterized their functions based on expression and secretion of the hemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp), virulence towards amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum and killing of Escherichia coli bacterial cells. We group the 17 proteins characterized in the T6SS locus into four categories: twelve (VipA, VipB, VCA0109-VCA0115, ClpV, VCA0119, and VasK) are essential for Hcp secretion and bacterial virulence, and thus likely function as structural components of the apparatus; two (VasH and VCA0122) are regulators that are required for T6SS gene expression and virulence; another two, VCA0121 and valine-glycine repeat protein G 3 (VgrG-3), are not essential for Hcp expression, secretion or bacterial virulence, and their functions are unknown; the last group is represented by VCA0118, which is not required for Hcp expression or secretion but still plays a role in both amoebae and bacterial killing and may therefore be an effector protein. We also showed that the clpV gene product is required for Dictyostelium virulence but is less important for killing E. coli. In addition, one vgrG gene (vgrG-2) outside of the T6SS gene cluster was required for bacterial killing but another (vgrG-1) was not. However, a bacterial killing defect was observed when vgrG-1 and vgrG-3 were both deleted. Several genes encoded in the same putative operon as vgrG-1 and vgrG-2 also contribute to virulence toward Dictyostelium but have a smaller effect on bacterial killing. Our results provide new insights into the functional requirements of V. cholerae's T6SS in the context of secretion as well as killing of bacterial and eukaryotic phagocytic cells.",

        "abstract": "Macropinocytosis, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism mediating nonspecific bulk uptake of extracellular fluid, has been ascribed diverse functions. How nascent macropinosomes mature after internalization remains largely unknown. By searching for proteins that localize on macropinosomes during the Rab5-to-Rab7 transition stage in Dictyostelium, we uncover a complex composed of two proteins, which we name PripA and TbcrA. We show that the Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion involves fusion of Rab5-marked early macropinosomes with Rab7-marked late macropinosomes. PripA links the two membrane compartments by interacting with PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and Rab7. In addition, PripA recruits TbcrA, which acts as a GAP, to turn off Rab5. Thus, the conversion to Rab7 is linked to inactivation of the upstream Rab5. Consistently, disruption of either pripA or tbcrA impairs Rab5 inactivation and macropinocytic cargo processing. Therefore, the PripA-TbcrA complex is the central component of a Rab GAP cascade that facilitates programmed Rab switch and efficient cargo trafficking during macropinosome maturation.",

        "abstract": "Generation of a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P(3)] gradient within the plasma membrane is important for cell polarization and chemotaxis in many eukaryotic cells. The gradient is produced by the combined activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to increase PI(3,4,5)P(3) on the membrane nearest the polarizing signal and PI(3,4,5)P(3) dephosphorylation by phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) elsewhere. Common to both of these enzymes is the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)], which is not only the substrate of PI3K and product of PTEN but also important for membrane binding of PTEN. Consequently, regulation of phospholipase C (PLC) activity, which hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P(2), could have important consequences for PI(3,4,5)P(3) localization. We investigate the role of PLC in PI(3,4,5)P(3)-mediated chemotaxis in Dictyostelium. plc-null cells are resistant to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and produce little PI(3,4,5)P(3) after cAMP stimulation, as monitored by the PI(3,4,5)P(3)-specific pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain of CRAC (PH(CRAC)GFP). In contrast, PLC overexpression elevates PI(3,4,5)P(3) and impairs chemotaxis in a similar way to loss of pten. PI3K localization at the leading edge of plc-null cells is unaltered, but dissociation of PTEN from the membrane is strongly reduced in both gradient and uniform stimulation with cAMP. These results indicate that local activation of PLC can control PTEN localization and suggest a novel mechanism to regulate the internal PI(3,4,5)P(3) gradient.",

        "abstract": "Collective migration is a key feature of the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum, where the binding of chemoattractants leads to the production and secretion of additional chemoattractant and the relay of the signal to neighboring cells. This then guides cells to migrate collectively in a head-to-tail fashion. We used mutants that were defective in signal relay to elucidate which quantitative metrics of cell migration are most strongly affected by signal relay and collective motion. We show that neither signal relay nor collective motion markedly impact the speed of cell migration. Cells maintained a preferred overall direction of motion for several minutes with similar persistence, regardless of whether or not they were attracted to moving neighbors, moving collectively in contact with their neighbors, or simply following a fixed exogenous signal. We quantitatively establish that signal relay not only increases the number of cells that respond to a chemotactic signal, but most remarkably, also transmits information about the location of the source accurately over large distances, independently of the strength of the exogenous signal. We envision that signal relay has a similar key role in the migration of a variety of chemotaxing mammalian cells that can relay chemoattractant signals.",

        "abstract": "Presenilin (PS) is the catalytic moiety of the gamma-secretase complex. PS and other gamma-secretase components are well conserved among metazoa, but their presence and function in more-distant species are not resolved. Because inappropriate gamma-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in humans is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease, understanding essential elements within each gamma-secretase component is crucial to functional studies. Diverged proteins have been identified in primitive plants but experiments have failed to demonstrate gamma-secretase activity. We have identified highly diverged orthologs for each gamma-secretase component in the ancient eukaryote Dictyostelium, which lacks equivalents of APP, Notch and other characterized PS/gamma-secretase substrates. We show that wild-type (WT) Dictyostelium is capable of amyloidogenic processing of ectopically expressed human APP to generate amyloid-beta peptides Abeta(40) and Abeta(42); strains deficient in gamma-secretase cannot produce Abeta peptides but accumulate processed intermediates of APP that co-migrate with the C-terminal fragments alpha- and beta-CTF of APP that are found in mammalian cells. We further demonstrate that Dictyostelium requires PS for phagocytosis and cell-fate specification in a cell-autonomous manner, and show that regulation of phagocytosis requires an active gamma-secretase, a pathway suggested, but not proven, to occur in mammalian and Drosophila cells. Our results indicate that PS signaling is an ancient process that arose prior to metazoan radiation, perhaps independently of Notch. Dictyostelium might serve to identify novel PS/gamma-secretase signaling targets and provide a unique system for high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries to select new therapeutic targets for diseases associated with this pathway.",

The genes that encode them are ancestral to life, occurring in all known dominions: viruses, Eubacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Bacterial recombinases are also present in viruses and eukaryotic groups (supergroups), presumably via ancestral events of lateral gene transfer. The eukaryotic recA genes have two distinct origins (mitochondrial and plastidial), whose acquisition by eukaryotes was possible via primary (bacteria-eukaryote) and/or secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiotic gene transfers (EGTs). Here we present a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the recA genealogy, with substantially increased taxonomic sampling in the bacteria, viruses, eukaryotes and a special focus on the key eukaryotic supergroup Amoebozoa, earlier represented only by Dictyostelium We demonstrate that several major eukaryotic lineages have lost the bacterial recombinases (including Opisthokonta and Excavata), whereas others have retained them (Amoebozoa, Archaeplastida and the SAR-supergroups). When absent, the bacterial recA homologues may have been lost entirely (secondary loss of canonical mitochondria) or replaced by other eukaryotic recombinases. RecA proteins have a transit peptide for organellar import, where they act. The reconstruction of the RecA phylogeny with its EGT events presented here retells the intertwined evolutionary history of eukaryotes and bacteria, while further illuminating the events of endosymbiosis in eukaryotes by expanding the collection of widespread genes that provide insight to this deep history.",

The CA-rich region was used in affinity chromatography with nuclear extracts and bound proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The CA-rich elements purify MrfA, a protein with extensive sequence similarity to animal Myelin-gene Regulatory Factor (MRF)-like proteins. The MRF-like proteins and MrfA also display more spatially limited but significant sequence similarity with the DNA binding domain of the yeast Ndt80 sporulation-specific transcription factor. Furthermore, the ecmA CA-rich elements show sequence similarity to the core consensus Ndt80 binding site (the MSE) and point mutation of highly conserved arginine residues in MrfA, that in Ndt80 make critical contacts with the MSE, ablate binding of MrfA to its sites within the ecmA promoter. MrfA null strains are delayed in multicellular development and highly defective in pstA-specific gene expression.

        "abstract": "We have identified a gene encoding RGS domain-containing protein kinase (RCK1), a novel regulator of G protein signaling domain-containing protein kinase. RCK1 mutant strains exhibit strong aggregation and chemotaxis defects. rck1 null cells chemotax approximately 50% faster than wild-type cells, suggesting RCK1 plays a negative regulatory role in chemotaxis. Consistent with this finding, overexpression of wild-type RCK1 reduces chemotaxis speed by approximately 40%. On cAMP stimulation, RCK1 transiently translocates to the membrane/cortex region with membrane localization peaking at approximately 10 s, similar to the kinetics of membrane localization of the pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins CRAC, Akt/PKB, and PhdA. RCK1 kinase activity also increases dramatically. The RCK1 kinase activity does not rapidly adapt, but decreases after the cAMP stimulus is removed. This is particularly novel considering that most other chemoattractant-activated kinases (e.g., Akt/PKB, ERK1, ERK2, and PAKa) rapidly adapt after activation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we further show that both the RGS and kinase domains are required for RCK1 function and that RCK1 kinase activity is required for the delocalization of RCK1 from the plasma membrane. Genetic evidence suggests RCK1 function lies downstream from Galpha2, the heterotrimeric G protein that couples to the cAMP chemoattractant receptors. We suggest that RCK1 might be part of an adaptation pathway that regulates aspects of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "The signalling molecule DIF-1 is required for normal cell fate choice and patterning in Dictyostelium. To understand how these developmental processes are regulated will require knowledge of how cells receive and respond to the DIF-1 signal. Previously, we have described a bZIP transcription factor, DimA, which is required for cells to respond to DIF-1. However, it was unknown whether DimA activity is required to activate the DIF response pathway in certain cells or is a component of the response pathway itself. In this study, we describe the identification of a DimA-related bZIP transcription factor, DimB. Rapid changes in the subcellular localisation of both DimA and DimB in response to DIF-1 suggest that they are directly downstream of the DIF-1 signal. Genetic and biochemical interactions between DimA and DimB provides evidence that their ability to regulate diverse targets in response to DIF-1 is partly due to their ability to form homo- and heterodimeric complexes. DimA and DimB are therefore direct regulators of cellular responses to DIF-1.",

Mutations of the WH1 domain of WASP led to a reduction in binding to WIPa, a newly identified homolog of mammalian WIP, a reduction of F-actin polymerization at the leading edge, and a reduction in chemotactic efficiency. WIPa localizes to sites of new pseudopod protrusion and colocalizes with WASP at the leading edge. WIPa increases F-actin elongation in vivo and in vitro in a WASP-dependent manner. WIPa translocates to the cortical membrane upon uniform cAMP stimulation in a time course that parallels F-actin polymerization. WIPa-overexpressing cells exhibit multiple microspike formation and defects in chemotactic efficiency due to frequent changes of direction. Reduced expression of WIPa by expressing a hairpin WIPa (hp WIPa) construct resulted in more polarized cells that exhibit a delayed response to a new chemoattractant source due to delayed extension of pseudopod toward the new gradient. These results suggest that WIPa is required for new pseudopod protrusion and prompt reorientation of cells toward a new gradient by initiating localized bursts of actin polymerization and/or elongation.",

A fragment of genomic DNA containing the gene to be disrupted is amplified by PCR, cloned into a plasmid vector using topoisomerase and then employed as the substrate in an in vitro Tn5 transposition reaction. The transposing species is a fragment of DNA containing a Dictyostelium blasticidin S resistance (bs(r)) cassette linked to a bacterial tetracycline resistance (tet(r)) cassette. After transposition the plasmid DNA is transformed into Escherichia coli and clones in which the bs(r)-tet(r) cassette is inserted into the Dictyostelium target DNA are identified. To demonstrate its utility we have employed the method to disrupt the gene encoding QkgA, a novel protein kinase identified from the Dictyostelium genome sequencing project. QkgA is structurally homologous to two previously identified Dictyostelium kinases, GbpC and pats1. Like them it contains a leucine-rich repeat domain, a small GTP-binding (ras) domain and a MEKK domain. Disruption of the qkgA gene causes a marked increase in growth rate and, during development, aggregation occurs relatively slowly to form abnormally large multicellular structures.",

        "abstract": "cotC requires the transcription factor CudA for its expression in the posterior, prespore cells of the slug, while the expL7 gene requires CudA for its expression in the anterior, tip-organiser region. In order to identify additional transcription factors that might mediate tip-organiser specific expression, we performed affinity chromatography on slug nuclear extracts. The affinity matrix bore cap-site distal sequences from region A of the expL7 promoter; an essential region located upstream of the CudA binding domain. One of the proteins purified was G-box binding factor (GBF), a zinc finger transcription factor which binds to G-rich elements, known as G boxes, that are present in the promoters of many developmental genes, including cotC. Previous work identified an essential sequence motif within region A and we show that this element is a G box, that binds recombinant GBF. Moreover, a G box from within the cotC promoter can substitute for region A of expL7 in directing tip-organiser specific expression of expL7. Thus the same two transcription factors, CudA and GBF, seem to co-operate to direct both tip-organiser and prespore gene expression. How then is specificity achieved? Replacing a CudA binding region in the cotC promoter with the CudA binding domain from expL7 strongly represses cotC promoter activity. Hence we suggest that differences in the topology of the multiple CudA half- sites contained within the two different CudA binding regions, coupled with differences in the signalling environment between tip-organiser cells and prespore cells, ensure correct expL7 expression.",

The fusion is achieved by simultaneous matrix tri-factorization that shares matrix factors between sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by evaluating its performance on predicting ontological annotations in slime mold D. discoideum and on recognizing proteins of baker's yeast S. cerevisiae that participate in the ribosome or are located in the cell membrane. Our approach achieves predictive performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art kernel-based data fusion, but requires fewer data preprocessing steps.",

        "abstract": "The <i>Dictyostelium</i> centrosome is a nucleus-associated body with a diameter of approx. 500 nm. It contains no centrioles but consists of a cylindrical layered core structure surrounded by a microtubule-nucleating corona. At the onset of mitosis, the corona disassembles and the core structure duplicates through growth, splitting, and reorganization of the outer core layers. During the last decades our research group has characterized the majority of the 42 known centrosomal proteins. In this work we focus on the conserved, previously uncharacterized Cep192 protein. We use superresolution expansion microscopy (ExM) to show that Cep192 is a component of the outer core layers. Furthermore, ExM with centrosomal marker proteins nicely mirrored all ultrastructurally known centrosomal substructures. Furthermore, we improved the proximity-dependent biotin identification assay (BioID) by adapting the biotinylase BioID2 for expression in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and applying a knock-in strategy for the expression of BioID2-tagged centrosomal fusion proteins. Thus, we were able to identify various centrosomal Cep192 interaction partners, including CDK5RAP2, which was previously allocated to the inner corona structure, and several core components. Studies employing overexpression of GFP-Cep192 as well as depletion of endogenous Cep192 revealed that Cep192 is a key protein for the recruitment of corona components during centrosome biogenesis and is required to maintain a stable corona structure.",

Their activity is under, respectively, positive and negative regulation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which together with their upstream regulators and the downstream targets of the small GTPases form formidable signalling networks. While genomics has revealed the large size of the GTPase, GEF and GAP repertoires, only a small fraction of their interactions and functions have yet been experimentally explored. Dictyostelid social amoebas have been particularly useful in unravelling the roles of many proteins in the Rac-Rho and Ras-Rap families of GTPases in directional cell migration and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Genomes and cell-type specific and developmental transcriptomes are available for <i>Dictyostelium</i> species that span the 0.5 billion years of evolution of the group from their unicellular ancestors. In this work, we identified all GTPases, GEFs and GAPs from genomes representative of the four major taxon groups and investigated their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary conservation and changes in their functional domain architecture and in their developmental and cell-type specific expression. We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis of the expression profiles of the ~2000 analysed genes to identify putative interacting sets of GTPases, GEFs and GAPs, which highlight sets known to interact experimentally and many novel combinations.

We present a molecular dissection of the GTPase Rab8a and the exocyst complex in tethering of the contractile vacuole to the plasma membrane, fusion, and final detachment. Right before discharge, the contractile vacuole bladder sequentially recruits Drainin, a Rab11a effector, Rab8a, the exocyst complex, and LvsA, a protein of the Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi family. Rab8a recruitment precedes the nucleotide-dependent arrival of the exocyst to the bladder by a few seconds. A dominant-negative mutant of Rab8a strongly binds to the exocyst and prevents recruitment to the bladder, suggesting that a Rab8a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity is associated with the complex. Absence of Drainin leads to overtethering and blocks fusion, whereas expression of constitutively active Rab8a allows fusion but blocks vacuole detachment from the plasma membrane, inducing complete fragmentation of tethered vacuoles. An indistinguishable phenotype is generated in cells lacking LvsA, implicating this protein in postfusion detethering. Of interest, overexpression of a constitutively active Rab8a mutant reverses the lvsA-null CV phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Tumor suppressor PTEN mainly functions at two subcellular locations, the plasma membrane and the nucleus. At the plasma membrane, PTEN dephosphorylates the tumorigenic second messenger PIP3, which drives cell proliferation and migration. In the nucleus, PTEN controls DNA repair and genome stability independently of PIP3. Whereas the concept that a conformational change regulates protein function through post-translational modifications has been well established in biology, it is unknown whether a conformational change simultaneously controls dual subcellular localizations of proteins. Here, we discovered that opening the conformation of PTEN is the crucial upstream event that determines its key dual localizations of this crucial tumor suppressor. We identify a critical conformational switch that regulates PTEN's localization. Most PTEN molecules are held in the cytosol in a closed conformation by intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal tail and core region. Dephosphorylation of the tail opens the conformation and exposes the membrane-binding regulatory interface in the core region, recruiting PTEN to the membrane. Moreover, a lysine at residue 13 is also exposed and when ubiquitinated, transports PTEN to the nucleus. Thus, opening the conformation of PTEN is a key mechanism that enhances its dual localization and enzymatic activity, providing a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatments.",

Interestingly, evolutionarily distant MF myosins have similar roles in the extension of actin-filled membrane protrusions such as filopodia and bind to microtubules (MT), suggesting that the core functions of these MF myosins have been highly conserved over evolution. The structures of two DdMyo7 signature MF domains have been determined and comparison with mammalian MF structures reveals that characteristic features of MF domains are conserved. However, across millions of years of evolution conserved class-specific insertions are seen to alter the surfaces and the orientation of subdomains with respect to each other, likely resulting in new sites for binding partners. The MyTH4 domains of Myo10 and DdMyo7 bind to MT with micromolar affinity but, surprisingly, their MT binding sites are on opposite surfaces of the MyTH4 domain. The structural analysis in combination with comparison of diverse MF myosin sequences provides evidence that myosin tail domain features can be maintained without strict conservation of motifs. The results illustrate how tuning of existing features can give rise to new structures while preserving the general properties necessary for myosin tails. Thus, tinkering with the MF domain enables it to serve as a multifunctional platform for cooperative recruitment of various partners, allowing common properties such as autoinhibition of the motor and microtubule binding to arise through convergent evolution.",

SMEK also has MEK1-independent functions: SMEK, but not MEK1, is required for proper cytokinesis during vegetative growth, timely exit from the mound stage during development, and myosin II assembly. SMEK localizes to the cell cortex through an EVH1 domain at its N terminus during vegetative growth. At the onset of development, SMEK translocates to the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its C terminus. The importance of SMEK's nuclear localization is demonstrated by our findings that a mutant lacking the EVH1 domain complements SMEK deficiency, whereas a mutant lacking the NLS does not. Microarray analysis reveals that some genes are precociously expressed in mek1(-) and erk1(-) cells. The misexpression of some of these genes is suppressed in the smkA deletion. These data suggest that loss of MEK1/ERK1 signaling compromises gene expression and chemotaxis in a SMEK-dependent manner.",

        "abstract": "It is assumed that ERK2 in Dictyostelium is subject to adaptive regulation in response to constant extracellular ligand stimulation. We now show, to the contrary, that ERK2 remains active under continuous stimulation, differing from most ligand-activated pathways in chemotactically competent Dictyostelium and other cells. We show that the upstream phosphorylation pathway, responsible for ERK2 activation, transiently responds to receptor stimulation, whereas ERK2 dephosphorylation (deactivation) is inhibited by continuous stimulation. We argue that the net result of these two regulatory actions is a persistently active ERK2 pathway when the extracellular ligand (i.e., cAMP) concentration is held constant and that oscillatory production/destruction of secreted cAMP in chemotaxing cells accounts for the observed oscillatory activity of ERK2. We also show that pathways controlling seven-transmembrane receptor (7-TMR) ERK2 activation/deactivation function independently of G proteins and ligand-induced production of intracellular cAMP and the consequent activation of PKA. Finally, we propose that this regulation enables ERK2 to function both in an oscillatory manner, critical for chemotaxis, and in a persistent manner, necessary for gene expression, as secreted ligand concentration increases during later development. This work redefines mechanisms of ERK2 regulation by 7-TMR signaling in Dictyostelium and establishes new implications for control of signal relay during chemotaxis.",

We describe the detailed characterization of two myosin constructs containing either point mutations F487A or F506G in the relay region. Dictyostelium cells transformed with F487A or F506G myosin are unable to undergo processes that require myosin II function, including fruiting-body formation, normal cytokinesis and growth in suspension. Our results show that the dominant-negative inhibition of myosin function is caused by disruption of the communication between active site and lever arm, which blocks motor activity completely, and perturbation of the communication between active site and actin-binding site, leading to an approximately 100-fold increase in the mutants' affinity for actin in the presence of ATP.",

The wound closed within 2-4\u2009sec, depending on the wound size. Cells could tolerate a wound size of less than 2.0\u2009\u00b5m. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the external medium, the wound pore did not close and cells ruptured. The release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores also contributed to the elevation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> but not to wound repair. Annexin C1 immediately accumulated at the wound site depending on the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and annexin C1 knockout cells had a defect in wound repair, but it was not essential. Dictyostelium cells were able to respond to multiple repeated wounds with the same time courses, in contrast to previous reports showing that the first wound accelerates the second wound repair in fibroblasts.",

In the present study, we report that disruption of PLD signalling causes unexpectedly profound effects on the actin-based motility of Dictyostelium. Cells in which PLD activity is inhibited by butan-1-ol show a complete loss of actin-based structures, accompanied by relocalization of F-actin into small clusters, and eventually the nucleus, without a visible fall in levels of F-actin. Addition of exogenous phosphatidic acid reverses the effects of butan-1-ol, confirming that these effects are caused by inhibition of PLD. Loss of motility correlates with complete inhibition of endocytosis and a reduction in phagocytosis. Inhibition of PLD caused a major decrease in the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which could again be reversed by exogenously applied phosphatidic acid. Thus the essential role of PLD signalling in both motility and endocytosis appears to be mediated directly via regulation of PtdIns(4)P kinase activity. This implies that localized PLD-regulated synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is essential for Dictyostelium actin function.",

        "abstract": "Hirano bodies are paracrystalline actin filament-containing structures reported to be associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the biological function of Hirano bodies remains poorly understood, since nearly all prior studies of these structures were done with postmortem samples of tissue. In the present study, we generated a full-length form of a Dictyostelium 34-kDa actin cross-linking protein with point mutations in the first putative EF hand, termed 34-kDa DeltaEF1. The 34-kDa DeltaEF1 protein binds calcium normally but has activated actin binding that is unregulated by calcium. The expression of the 34-kDa DeltaEF1 protein in Dictyostelium induces the formation of Hirano bodies, as assessed by both fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Dictyostelium cells bearing Hirano bodies grow normally, indicating that Hirano bodies are not associated with cell death and are not deleterious to cell growth. Moreover, the expression of the 34-kDa DeltaEF1 protein rescues the phenotypes of cells lacking the 34-kDa protein and cells lacking both the 34-kDa protein and alpha-actinin. Finally, the expression of the 34-kDa DeltaEF1 protein also initiates the formation of Hirano bodies in cultured mouse fibroblasts. These results show that the failure to regulate the activity and/or affinity of an actin cross-linking protein can provide a signal for the formation of Hirano bodies. More generally, the formation of Hirano bodies is a cellular response to or a consequence of aberrant function of the actin cytoskeleton.",

In the formation of this complex, structure-specific recognition protein-1 (SSRP1) heterodimerizes with suppressor of Ty 16 (SPT16). SSRP1 also has SPT16-independent functions, but how SSRP1 functions alone remains elusive. Here, using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques, we characterized human SSRP1 and that from the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and show that both orthologs form an elongated homodimer in solution. We found that substitutions in the SSRP1 pleckstrin homology domain known to bind SPT16 also disrupt SSRP1 homodimerization. Moreover, AUC and SAXS analyses revealed that SSRP1 homodimerization and heterodimerization with SPT16 (resulting in FACT) involve the same SSRP1 surface, namely the PH2 region, and that the FACT complex contains only one molecule of SSRP1. These observations suggest that SSRP1 homo- and heterodimerization might be mutually exclusive. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetry analyses disclosed that SSRP1 binds both histones H2A-H2B and H3-H4 and that disruption of SSRP1 homodimerization decreases its histone-binding affinity. Together, our results provide evidence for regulation of SSRP1 by homodimerization and suggest a potential role for homodimerization in facilitating SPT16-independent functions of SSRP1.",

In particular, phagocytes have to explore their environment in the search for particles to be ingested. To examine how cells decide between competing surfaces, we exposed single cells of Dictyostelium to a defined three-dimensional space by confining them between two planar surfaces: those of a cover glass and of a wedged microcantilever. These cells form propagating waves of filamentous actin and PIP3 on their ventral substrate-attached surface. The dynamics of wave formation in the confined cells was explored using two-focus fluorescence imaging. When waves formed on one substrate, wave formation on the other substrate was efficiently suppressed. The propensity for wave formation switched between the opposing cell surfaces with periods of 2-5\u00a0min by one of two modes: 1) a rolling mode involving the slipping of a wave along the nonattached plasma membrane and\u00a02) de novo initiation of waves on the previously blank cell surface. These data provide evidence for a cell-autonomous oscillator that switches dorso-ventral polarity in a cell simultaneously exposed to multiple substrate surfaces.",

Regulation of actin assembly and reorganization is crucial for various cellular events, such as cell migration, cell division, and development. Here, to examine the roles of ADF-H domain-containing protein (also known as glia maturation factor; GmfA), the product of a single GMF homologous gene in Dictyostelium, gmfA-null cells were generated. They had moderate defects in cell growth and cytokinesis. Interestingly, they showed a keratocyte-like fan shape with a broader pseudopod, where Arp3 accumulated at higher levels than in wild-type cells. They migrated with higher persistence, but their velocities were comparable to those of wild-type cells. The polar pseudopods during cell division were also broader than those in wild-type cells. However, GmfA did not localize at the pseudopods in migrating cells or the polar pseudopods in dividing cells. Adhesions of mutant cells to the substratum were much stronger than that of wild-type cells. Although the mutant cells showed chemotaxis comparable to that of wild-type cells, they formed disconnected streams during the aggregation stage; however, they finally formed normal fruiting bodies. These results suggest that GmfA plays a crucial role in cell migration.",

In slugs DimB is specifically nuclear enriched in the pstB cells; a cluster of vital dye-staining cells located on the ventral surface of the posterior, prespore region. PstB cells move at culmination, to form the lower cup and the outer basal disc of the fruiting body, and DimB retains a high nuclear concentration in both these tissues. In a dimB null (dimB-) strain there are very few pstB or lower cup cells, as detected by neutral red staining, and it is known that the outer basal disc is absent or much reduced. In the dimB- strain ecmB, a marker of pstB differentiation, is not DIF inducible. Furthermore, ChIP analysis shows that DimB binds to the ecmB promoter in DIF-induced cells. These results suggest that the differentiation of pstB cells is caused by a high perceived level of DIF-1 signalling, leading to nuclear localization of DimB and direct activation of cell type-specific gene expression.",

We now show that expression of Y53A-actin, which does not affect cell growth, phagocytosis, or pinocytosis, inhibits the formation of head-to-tail cell streams during cAMP-induced aggregation, although individual amoebae chemotax normally. We show that expression of Y53A-actin causes a 50% reduction of cell surface cAMP receptors, and inhibits cAMP-induced increases in adenylyl cyclase A activity, phosphorylation of ERK2, and actin polymerization. Trafficking of vesicles containing adenylyl cyclase A to the rear of the cell and secretion of the ACA vesicles are also inhibited. The actin cytoskeleton of cells expressing Y53A-actin is characterized by numerous short filaments, and bundled and aggregated filaments similar to the structures formed by copolymerization of purified Y53A-actin and wild-type actin in vitro. This disorganized actin cytoskeleton may be responsible for the inhibition of intracellular and intercellular cAMP signaling in cells expressing F-Y53A-actin.",

        "abstract": "O-Glycosylation is an increasingly recognized modification of intracellular proteins in all kingdoms of life, and its occurrence in protists has been investigated to understand its evolution and its roles in the virulence of unicellular pathogens. We focus here on two kinds of glycoregulation found in unicellular eukaryotes: one is a simple O-fucose modification of dozens if not hundreds of Ser/Thr-rich proteins, and the other a complex pentasaccharide devoted to a single protein associated with oxygen sensing and the assembly of polyubiquitin chains. These modifications are not required for life but contingently modulate biological processes in the social amoeba Dictyostelium and the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, and likely occur in diverse unicellular protists. O-Glycosylation that is co-localized in the cytoplasm allows for glycoregulation over the entire life of the protein, contrary to the secretory pathway where glycosylation usually occurs before its delivery to its site of function. Here, we interpret cellular roles of nucleocytoplasmic glycans in terms of current evidence for their effects on the conformation and dynamics of protist proteins, to serve as a guide for future studies to examine their broader significance.",

        "abstract": "Actin waves that travel on the planar membrane of a substrate-attached cell underscore the capability of the actin system to assemble into dynamic structures by the recruitment of proteins from the cytoplasm. The waves have no fixed shape, can reverse their direction of propagation and can fuse or divide. Actin waves separate two phases of the plasma membrane that are distinguished by their lipid composition. The area circumscribed by a wave resembles in its phosphoinositide content the interior of a phagocytic cup, leading us to explore the possibility that actin waves are in-plane phagocytic structures generated without the localized stimulus of an attached particle. Consistent with this view, wave-forming cells were found to exhibit a high propensity for taking up particles. Cells fed rod-shaped particles produced elongated phagocytic cups that displayed a zonal pattern that reflected in detail the actin and lipid pattern of free-running actin waves. Neutrophils and macrophages are known to spread on surfaces decorated with immune complexes, a process that has been interpreted as \"frustrated\" phagocytosis. We suggest that actin waves enable a phagocyte to scan a surface for particles that might be engulfed.",

In addition, Dictyostelium cells polarize in response to extracellular cAMP, although a potential role for GSK3 in this pathway has not been investigated. Previously, we had shown that ZAK1 was an activating tyrosine kinase for GSK3 function in Dictyostelium and we now identify ZAK2 as the other tyrosine kinase in the cAMP-activation pathway for GSK3; no additional family members exist. We also now show that tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of GSK3 by ZAK2 and ZAK1 separately regulate GSK3 in distinct differentiated cell populations, and that ZAK2 acts in both autonomous and non-autonomous pathways to regulate these cell-type differentiations. Finally, we demonstrate that efficient polarization of Dictyostelium towards cAMP depends on ZAK1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK3. Combinatorial regulation of GSK3 by ZAK kinases in Dictyostelium guides cell polarity, directional cell migration and cell differentiation, pathways that extend the complexity of GSK3 signaling throughout the development of Dictyostelium.",

Recently, we characterized <i>Dictyostelium</i> NE81 as an evolutionarily conserved lamin-like protein, both on the sequence and functional level. Here, we show on the structural level that the <i>Dictyostelium</i> NE81 is also capable of assembling into filaments, just as metazoan lamin filament assemblies. Using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, we show that NE81 expressed in <i>Xenopous</i> oocytes forms filamentous structures with an overall appearance highly reminiscent of <i>Xenopus</i> lamin B2. The in vitro assembly properties of recombinant His-tagged NE81 purified from <i>Dictyostelium</i> extracts are very similar to those of metazoan lamins. Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) and expansion microscopy (ExM), as well as transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained purified NE81, demonstrated its capability of forming filamentous structures under low-ionic-strength conditions.

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium</i> development begins with single-cell starvation and ends with multicellular fruiting bodies. Developmental morphogenesis is accompanied by sweeping transcriptional changes, encompassing nearly half of the 13,000 genes in the genome. We performed time-series RNA-sequencing analyses of the wild type and 20 mutants to explore the relationships between transcription and morphogenesis. These strains show developmental arrest at different stages, accelerated development, or atypical morphologies. Considering eight major morphological transitions, we identified 1371 milestone genes whose expression changes sharply between consecutive transitions. We also identified 1099 genes as members of 21 regulons, which are groups of genes that remain coordinately regulated despite the genetic, temporal, and developmental perturbations. The gene annotations in these groups validate known transitions and reveal new developmental events. For example, DNA replication genes are tightly coregulated with cell division genes, so they are expressed in mid-development although chromosomal DNA is not replicated. Our data set includes 486 transcriptional profiles that can help identify new relationships between transcription and development and improve gene annotations. We show its utility by showing that cycles of aggregation and disaggregation in allorecognition-defective mutants involve dedifferentiation. We also show sensitivity to genetic and developmental conditions in two commonly used actin genes, <i>act6</i> and <i>act15</i>, and robustness of the <i>coaA</i> gene. Finally, we propose that <i>gpdA</i> is a better mRNA quantitation standard because it is less sensitive to external conditions than commonly used standards.

We describe a fluorescence-based phenotypic assay in a 1536-well plate format for high-throughput screening of novel inhibitors of chemotaxis/migration within complex libraries of thousands of compounds. Although the assay utilizes the unique cellular response properties of Dictyostelium, the compounds identified are able to inhibit chemotaxis of mammalian cells. In addition, a parallel cell cytotoxicity counter-screen with an ATP content assay is described that eliminates cytotoxic compounds from the screen. This novel compound screening approach enables rapid identification of novel lead compounds that inhibit chemotaxis in human and other cells for drug development and research tools. \u00a9 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The soil amoeba Dictyostelium is an obligate aerobe that monitors O(2) for informational purposes in addition to utilizing it for oxidative metabolism. Whereas low O(2) suffices for proliferation, a higher level is required for slugs to culminate into fruiting bodies, and O(2) influences slug polarity, slug migration, and cell-type proportioning. Dictyostelium expresses a cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1) known to mediate O(2)-sensing in animals, but lacks HIFalpha, a major hydroxylation target whose accumulation directly induces animal hypoxia-dependent transcriptional changes. The O(2)-requirement for culmination is increased by P4H1-gene disruption and reduced by P4H1 overexpression. A target of Dictyostelium P4H1 is Skp1, a subunit of the SCF-class of E3-ubiquitin ligases related to the VBC-class that mediates hydroxylation-dependent degradation of animal HIFalpha. Skp1 is a target of a novel cytoplasmic O-glycosylation pathway that modifies HyPro143 with a pentasaccharide, and glycosyltransferase mutants reveal that glycosylation intermediates have antagonistic effects toward P4H1 in O(2)-signaling. Current evidence indicates that Skp1 is the only glycosylation target in cells, based on metabolic labeling, biochemical complementation, and enzyme specificity studies. Bioinformatics studies suggest that the HyPro-modification pathway existed in the ancestral eukaryotic lineage and was retained in selected modern day unicellular organisms whose life cycles experience varying degrees of hypoxia. It is proposed that, in Dictyostelium and other protists including the agent for human toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii, prolyl hydroxylation and glycosylation mediate O(2)-signaling in hierarchical fashion via Skp1 to control the proteome, directly via degradation rather than indirectly via transcription as found in animals.",

        "abstract": "Cell motility of amoeboid cells is mediated by localized F-actin polymerization that drives the extension of membrane protrusions to promote forward movements. We show that deletion of either of two members of the Dictyostelium Dock180 family of RacGEFs, DockA and DockD, causes decreased speed of chemotaxing cells. The phenotype is enhanced in the double mutant and expression of DockA or DockD complements the reduced speed of randomly moving DockD null cells' phenotype, suggesting that DockA and DockD are likely to act redundantly and to have similar functions in regulating cell movement. In this regard, we find that overexpressing DockD causes increased cell speed by enhancing F-actin polymerization at the sites of pseudopod extension. DockD localizes to the cell cortex upon chemoattractant stimulation and at the leading edge of migrating cells and this localization is dependent on PI3K activity, suggesting that DockD might be part of the pathway that links PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) production to F-actin polymerization. Using a proteomic approach, we found that DdELMO1 is associated with DockD and that Rac1A and RacC are possible in vivo DockD substrates. In conclusion, our work provides a further understanding of how cell motility is controlled and provides evidence that the molecular mechanism underlying Dock180-related protein function is evolutionarily conserved.",

        "abstract": "cAR1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for cAMP, is required for the multicellular development of Dictyostelium. The activation of multiple pathways by cAR1 is transient because of poorly defined adaptation mechanisms. To investigate this, we used a genetic screen for impaired development to isolate four dominant-negative cAR1 mutants, designated DN1-4. The mutant receptors inhibit multiple cAR1-mediated responses known to undergo adaptation. Reduced in vitro adenylyl cyclase activation by GTPgammaS suggests that they cause constitutive adaptation of this and perhaps other pathways. In addition, the DN mutants are constitutively phosphorylated, which normally requires cAMP binding and possess cAMP affinities that are approximately 100-fold higher than that of wild-type cAR1. Two independent activating mutations, L100H and I104N, were identified. These residues occupy adjacent positions near the cytoplasmic end of the receptor's third transmembrane helix and correspond to the (E/D)RY motif of numerous mammalian GPCRs, which is believed to regulate their activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the DN mutants are constitutively activated and block development by turning on natural adaptation mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "To study reorganization of the actin system in cells that invert their polarity, we stimulated Dictyostelium cells by mechanical forces from alternating directions. The cells oriented in a fluid flow by establishing a protruding front directed against the flow and a retracting tail. Labels for polymerized actin and filamentous myosin-II marked front and tail. At 2.1 Pa, actin first disassembled at the previous front before it began to polymerize at the newly induced front. In contrast, myosin-II slowly disappeared from the previous tail and continuously redistributed to the new tail. Front specification was myosin-II independent and accumulation of polymerized actin was even more focused in mutants lacking myosin-II heavy chains. We conclude that under mechanical stimulation, the inversion of cell polarity is initiated by a global internal signal that turns down actin polymerization in the entire cell. It is thought to be elicited at the most strongly stimulated site of the cell, the incipient front region, and to be counterbalanced by a slowly generated, short-range signal that locally activates actin polymerization at the front. Similar pattern of front and tail interconversion were observed in cells reorienting in strong gradients of the chemoattractant cyclic AMP.",

        "abstract": "Regulated cell adhesion and motility have important roles during growth, development and tissue homeostasis. Consequently, great efforts have been made to identify genes that control these processes. One candidate is Rap1, as it has been implicated in the regulation of adhesion and motility in cell culture. To further study the role of Rap1 during multicellular development, we generated a mutant in a potential Rap1 GTPase activating protein (RapGAPB) in Dictyostelium. rapGAPB(-) cells have increased levels of active Rap1 compared with wild-type cells, indicating that RapGAPB regulates Rap1 activity. Furthermore, rapGAPB(-) cells exhibit hallmark phenotypes of other known mutants with hyperactivated Rap1, including increased substrate adhesion and abnormal F-actin distribution. However, unlike these other mutants, rapGAPB(-) cells do not exhibit impaired motility or chemotaxis, indicating that RapGAPB might only regulate specific roles of Rap1. Importantly, we also found that RapGAPB regulates Rap1 activity during multicellular development and is required for normal morphogenesis. First, streams of aggregating rapGAPB(-) cells break up as a result of decreased cell-cell adhesion. Second, rapGAPB(-) cells exhibit cell-autonomous defects in prestalk cell patterning. Using cell-type-specific markers, we demonstrate that RapGAPB is required for the correct sorting behaviour of different cell types. Finally, we show that inactivation of RapGAPB affects prestalk and prespore cell adhesion. We therefore propose that a possible mechanism for RapGAPB-regulated cell sorting is through differential adhesion.",

        "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) is the most widely prescribed epilepsy treatment worldwide, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Our previous work identified a previously unknown effect of VPA in reducing phosphoinositide production in the simple model Dictyostelium followed by the transfer of data to a mammalian synaptic release model. In our current study, we show that the reduction in phosphoinositide [PtdInsP (also known as PIP) and PtdInsP(2) (also known as PIP(2))] production caused by VPA is acute and dose dependent, and that this effect occurs independently of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, inositol recycling and inositol synthesis. In characterising the structural requirements for this effect, we also identify a family of medium-chain fatty acids that show increased efficacy compared with VPA. Within the group of active compounds is a little-studied group previously associated with seizure control, and analysis of two of these compounds (nonanoic acid and 4-methyloctanoic acid) shows around a threefold enhanced potency compared with VPA for protection in an in vitro acute rat seizure model. Together, our data show that VPA and a newly identified group of medium-chain fatty acids reduce phosphoinositide levels independently of inositol regulation, and suggest the reinvestigation of these compounds as treatments for epilepsy.",

        "abstract": "In a motile eukaryotic cell, front protrusion and tail retraction are superimposed on each other. To single out mechanisms that result in front to tail or in tail to front transition, we separated the two processes in time using cells that oscillate between a full front and a full tail state. State transitions were visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy using as a front marker PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol [3,4,5] tris-phosphate), and as a tail marker the tumor-suppressor PTEN (phosphatase tensin homolog) that degrades PIP3. Negative fluctuations in the PTEN layer of the membrane gated a local increase in PIP3. In a subset of areas lacking PTEN (PTEN holes), PIP3 was amplified until a propagated wave was initiated. Wave propagation implies that a PIP3 signal is transmitted by a self-sustained process, such that the temporal and spatial profiles of the signal are maintained during passage of the wave across the entire expanse of the cell membrane. Actin clusters were remodeled into a ring along the perimeter of the expanding PIP3 wave. The reverse transition of PIP3 to PTEN was linked to the previous site of wave initiation: where PIP3 decayed first, the entry of PTEN was primed.",

These changes require a means for sensing and interpreting the signalling cues, for generating the forces that act on the cell's physical material, and a control system to regulate this process. Experiments on Dictyostelium amoebae have shown that force-generating proteins can localize in response to external mechanical perturbations. This mechanosensing, and the ensuing mechanical feedback, plays an important role in minimizing the effect of mechanical disturbances in the course of changes in cell shape, especially during cell division, and likely in other contexts, such as during three-dimensional migration. Owing to the complexity of the feedback system, which couples mechanical and biochemical signals involved in shape regulation, theoretical approaches can guide further investigation by providing insights that are difficult to decipher experimentally. Here, we present a computational model that explains the different mechanosensory and mechanoresponsive behaviours observed in Dictyostelium cells. The model features a multiscale description of myosin II bipolar thick filament assembly that includes cooperative and force-dependent myosin-actin binding, and identifies the feedback mechanisms hidden in the observed mechanoresponsive behaviours of Dictyostelium cells during micropipette aspiration experiments. These feedbacks provide a mechanistic explanation of cellular retraction and hence cell shape regulation.",

Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that two RasGEFs can each act on specific Ras proteins. During Dictyostelium development, RasC and RasG are activated in response to cyclic AMP, with each regulating different downstream functions: RasG regulates chemotaxis and RasC is responsible for adenylyl cyclase activation. RasC activation was abolished in a gefA- mutant, whereas RasG activation was normal in this strain, indicating that RasGEFA activates RasC but not RasG. Conversely, RasC activation was normal in a gefR- mutant, whereas RasG activation was greatly reduced, indicating that RasGEFR activates RasG. These results were confirmed by the finding that RasGEFA and RasGEFR specifically released GDP from RasC and RasG, respectively, in vitro. This RasGEF target specificity provides a mechanism for one upstream signal to regulate two downstream processes using independent pathways.",

In this study, we took advantage of Dictyostelium which possesses only one member of the Ena/VASP family to investigate the functional roles of VASP phosphorylation. Our results demonstrated that hyperosmotic stress and cAMP stimulation cause VASP phosphorylation. VASP phosphorylation plays a negative role for the early steps of filopodia/microspikes formation. VASP phosphorylation appears to modulate VASP localization at the membrane cortex and its interactions with WASP and WIPa.

These subunits induce intracellular responses that can be highly polarized when a cell experiences a gradient of chemoattractant. Exactly how a cell achieves this amplified signal polarization is still not well understood. Here, we quantitatively measure temporal and spatial changes of receptor occupancy, G-protein activation by FRET imaging, and PIP3 levels by monitoring the dynamics of PH(Crac)-GFP translocation in single living cells in response to different chemoattractant fields. Our results provided the first direct evidence that G-proteins are activated to different extents on the cell surface in response to asymmetrical stimulations. A stronger, uniformly applied stimulation triggers not only a stronger G-protein activation but also a faster adaptation of downstream responses. When naive cells (which have not experienced chemoattractant) were abruptly exposed to stable cAMP gradients, G-proteins were persistently activated throughout the entire cell surface, whereas the response of PH(Crac)-GFP translocation surprisingly consisted of two phases, an initial transient and asymmetrical translocation around the cell membrane, followed by a second phase producing a highly polarized distribution of PH(Crac)-GFP. We propose a revised model of gradient sensing, suggesting an important role for locally controlled components that inhibit PI3Kinase activity.",

In Dictyostelium, two immunoglobulin-like adhesion proteins, TgrB1 and TgrC1, are essential components with dual roles in morphogenesis and allorecognition during development. TgrB1 and TgrC1 form a heterophilic adhesion complex during cell contact and mediate intercellular communication. The underlying signaling pathways, however, have not been characterized. Here, we report on a mutation that suppresses the tgrB-tgrC1-defective developmental arrest. The mutated gene alg9 encodes a putative mannosyl transferase that participates in N-linked protein glycosylation. We show that alteration in N-linked glycosylation, caused by an alg9 mutation with a plasmid insertion (alg9(ins)) or tunicamycin treatment, can partially suppress the developmental phenotypes caused by tgrC1 deletion or replacement with an incompatible allele. The alg9(ins) mutation also preferentially primed cells toward a stalk-cell fate. Despite its effect on development, we found that altered N-linked glycosylation had no discernable effect on TgrB1-TgrC1-mediated allorecognition. Our results show that N-linked protein glycosylation can modulate developmental processes without disturbing cell-cell recognition, suggesting that tgrB1 and tgrC1 have distinct effects in the two processes.",

Using a forward genetic screen in Dictyostelium discoideum, we identified the Ste20 kinase KrsB, a homolog of tumor suppressors Hippo and MST1/2, as a negative regulator of cell spreading and substrate attachment. The excessive adhesion of krsB(-) cells reduced directional movement and prolonged the streaming phase of multicellular aggregation. These phenotypes depended on an intact kinase domain and phosphorylation of a conserved threonine (T176) within the activation loop. Chemoattractants triggered a rapid, transient autophosphorylation of T176 in a heterotrimeric G protein-dependent and PI3K- and TorC2-independent manner. The active phosphorylated form of KrsB acts to decrease adhesion to the substrate. Taken together these studies suggest that cycling between active and inactive forms of KrsB may provide the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion needed for proper cell migration and chemotaxis. KrsB interacts genetically with another D. discoideum Hippo/MST homolog, KrsA, but the two genes are not functionally redundant. These studies show that Hippo/MST proteins, like the tumor suppressor PTEN and oncogenes Ras and PI3K, play a key role in cell morphological events in addition to their role in regulating cell growth.",

Our follow-up research uncovered that B56 preferentially associated with GDP forms of RasC and RasD, but not with RasG in vitro, and psrA(-) cells displayed inefficient activation of multiple Ras species, decreased random motility, and inefficient chemotaxis toward cAMP and folic acid gradient. Surprisingly, psrA(-) cells displayed aberrantly high basal and poststimulus phosphorylation of Dictyostelium protein kinase B (PKB) kinase family member PKBR1 and PKB substrates. Expression of constitutively active Ras mutants or inhibition of GSK3 in psrA(-) cells increased activities of both PKBR1 and PKBA, but only the PKBR1 activity was increased in wild-type cells under the equivalent conditions, indicating that either B56- or GSK3-mediated suppressive mechanism is sufficient to maintain low PKBA activity, but both mechanisms are necessary for suppressing PKBR1. Finally, cells lacking RasD or RasC displayed normal PKBR1 regulation under GSK3-inhibiting conditions, indicating that RasC or RasD proteins are essential for GSK3-mediated PKBR1 inhibition. In summary, B56 constitutes inhibitory circuits for PKBA and PKBR1 and thus heavily affects Dictyostelium chemotaxis.",

We have cloned a complete cDNA of Dictyostelium EB1 (DdEB1), the largest known EB1 homolog (57 kDa). Immunofluorescence analysis and expression of a green fluorescent protein-DdEB1 fusion protein revealed that DdEB1 localizes along microtubules, at microtubule tips, centrosomes, and protruding pseudopods. During mitosis, it was found at the spindle, spindle poles, and kinetochores. DdEB1 is the first EB1-homolog that is also a genuine centrosomal component, because it was localized at isolated centrosomes that are free of microtubules. Furthermore, centrosomal DdEB1 distribution was unaffected by nocodazole treatment. DdEB1 colocalized with DdCP224, the XMAP215 homolog, at microtubule tips, the centrosome, and kinetochores. Furthermore, both proteins were part of the same cytosolic protein complex, suggesting that they may act together in their functions. DdEB1 deletion mutants expressed as green fluorescent protein or maltose-binding fusion proteins indicated that microtubule binding requires homo-oligomerization, which is mediated by a coiled-coil domain. A DdEB1 null mutant was viable but retarded in prometaphase progression due to a defect in spindle formation.

However, it is not clear how these transitions are regulated in complex cell populations, in which cells receive multiple inputs. We address this issue using Dictyostelium cells undergoing development in their physiological niche. A continuous single cell transcriptomics time series identifies a sharp 'jump' in global gene expression marking functionally different cell states. By simultaneously imaging the physiological dynamics of transcription and signalling, we show the jump coincides with the onset of collective oscillations of cAMP. Optogenetic control of cAMP pulses shows that different jump genes respond to distinct dynamic features of signalling. Late jump gene expression changes are almost completely dependent on cAMP, whereas transcript changes at the onset of the jump require additional input. The coupling of collective signalling with gene expression is a potentially powerful strategy to drive robust cell state transitions in heterogeneous signalling environments. Based on the context of the jump, we also conclude that sharp gene expression transitions may not be sufficient for commitment.",

Similarly to chemoattractants, the shear flow-induced signal transduction events displayed features of excitability, including the ability to mount a full response irrespective of the length of the stimulation and a refractory period that is shared with that generated by chemoattractants. Loss of G protein subunits, inhibition of multiple signal transduction events, or disruption of calcium signaling attenuated the response to acute mechanical stimulation. Unlike the response to chemoattractants, an intact actin cytoskeleton was essential for reacting to mechanical perturbation.

We have observed that the formation of pseudopodia is highly ordered with two types of pseudopodia: First, de novo formation of pseudopodia at random positions on the cell body, and therefore in random directions. Second, pseudopod splitting near the tip of the current pseudopod in alternating right/left directions, leading to a persistent zig-zag trajectory. Here we analyzed the probability frequency distributions of the angles between pseudopodia and used this information to design a stochastic model for cell movement. Monte Carlo simulations show that the critical elements are the ratio of persistent splitting pseudopodia relative to random de novo pseudopodia, the Left/Right alternation, the angle between pseudopodia and the variance of this angle. Experiments confirm predictions of the model, showing reduced persistence in mutants that are defective in pseudopod splitting and in mutants with an irregular cell surface.",

        "abstract": "Cell-shape changes associated with processes like cytokinesis and motility proceed on several-second timescales but are derived from molecular events, including protein-protein interactions, filament assembly, and force generation by molecular motors, all of which occur much faster [1-4]. Therefore, defining the dynamics of such molecular machinery is critical for understanding cell-shape regulation. In addition to signaling pathways, mechanical stresses also direct cytoskeletal protein accumulation [5-7]. A myosin-II-based mechanosensory system controls cellular contractility and shape during cytokinesis and under applied stress [6, 8]. In Dictyostelium, this system tunes myosin II accumulation by feedback through the actin network, particularly through the crosslinker cortexillin I. Cortexillin-binding IQGAPs are major regulators of this system. Here, we defined the short timescale dynamics of key cytoskeletal proteins during cytokinesis and under mechanical stress, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to examine the dynamic interplay between these proteins. Equatorially enriched proteins including cortexillin I, IQGAP2, and myosin II recovered much more slowly than actin and polar crosslinkers. The mobility of equatorial proteins was greatly reduced at the furrow compared to the interphase cortex, suggesting their stabilization during cytokinesis. This mobility shift did not arise from a single biochemical event, but rather from a global inhibition of protein dynamics by mechanical-stress-associated changes in the cytoskeletal structure. Mechanical tuning of contractile protein dynamics provides robustness to the cytoskeletal framework responsible for regulating cell shape and contributes to cytokinesis fidelity.",

        "abstract": "The heterotetrameric AP and F-COPI complexes help to define the cellular map of modern eukaryotes. To search for related machinery, we developed a structure-based bioinformatics tool, and identified the core subunits of TSET, a 'missing link' between the APs and COPI. Studies in Dictyostelium indicate that TSET is a heterohexamer, with two associated scaffolding proteins. TSET is non-essential in Dictyostelium, but may act in plasma membrane turnover, and is essentially identical to the recently described TPLATE complex, TPC. However, whereas TPC was reported to be plant-specific, we can identify a full or partial complex in every eukaryotic supergroup. An evolutionary path can be deduced from the earliest origins of the heterotetramer/scaffold coat to its multiple manifestations in modern organisms, including the mammalian muniscins, descendants of the TSET medium subunits. Thus, we have uncovered the machinery for an ancient and widespread pathway, which provides new insights into early eukaryotic evolution.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02866.001.",

        "abstract": "In neutrophils and Dictyostelium, chemoattractant gradients generate directed cell migration by eliciting signaling events that bias intrinsic motility and favor the production and retention of upgradient pseudopods. Phosphoinositides are actively regulated during chemotaxis in these cells, most iconically in the production of PI(3,4,5)P3 gradients within the plasma membrane. Although it is now known that PI(3,4,5)P3 signaling is nonessential for gradient sensing, the role of the related phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is little understood, despite its clear importance in many cell biological processes. We describe here a PIP5 kinase, PikI, which produces PI(4,5)P2 and is essential for efficient chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells. Without PikI, PI(4,5)P2 levels are reduced by 90%, and while pikI(-) cells move at normal speeds, they are highly disorientated in cAMP gradients. Following chemotactic stimulation, Ras is efficiently activated in pikI(-) cells, yet Ras-dependent responses (including activation of PKB) are severely impaired. PikI is phosphorylated by PKB, and in vitro studies of a phosphomimic mutant suggest that this phosphorylation increases PikI activity. We propose that adequate PI(4,5)P2 levels are required to couple activated Ras to its downstream effectors and that these levels are regulated by PikI, making it a crucial player in gradient sensing.",

After multiple unsuccessful attempts of generating Dictyostelium lkb1-null cells, an RNAi-based knockdown approach proved effective. Depletion of lkb1 with a knockdown construct displayed severe reduction in prespore cell differentiation and precocious induction of prestalk cells, which were reminiscent of cells lacking GSK3. Similar to gsk3(-) cells, lkb1 depleted cells displayed lower GSK3 activity than wild type cells during development and compromised cAMP-mediated inhibition of the DIF-1 mediated ecmB induction. In response to stress insult, the kinase activity of LKB1, but not that of GSK3, increased. Therefore, LKB1 positively functions at the upstream of GSK3 during development and responds to stress insults independently from GSK3.",

We show that Roco2, a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-related Roco kinase, is activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation and helps mediate cell polarization and chemotaxis by regulating cortical F-actin polymerization and pseudopod extension in a pathway that requires Rab1A. We found that Roco2 binds the small GTPase Rab1A as well as the F-actin cross-linking protein filamin (actin-binding protein 120, abp120) in vivo. We show that active Rab1A (Rab1A-GTP) is required for and regulates Roco2 kinase activity in vivo and that filamin lies downstream from Roco2 and controls pseudopod extension during chemotaxis and random cell motility. Therefore our study uncovered a new signaling pathway that involves Rab1A and controls the actin cytoskeleton and pseudopod extension, and thereby, cell polarity and motility. These findings also may have implications in the regulation of other Roco kinases, including possibly LRRK2, in metazoans.",

        "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) phosphorylate the neutral lipid diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). In mammalian systems DGKs are a complex family of at least nine isoforms that are thought to participate in down-regulation of DG-based signalling pathways and perhaps activation of PA-stimulated signalling events. We report here that the simple protozoan amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum appears to contain a single gene encoding a DGK enzyme. This gene, dgkA, encodes a deduced protein that contains three C1-type cysteine-rich repeats, a DGK catalytic domain most closely related to the theta subtype of mammalian DGKs and a C-terminal segment containing a proline/glutamine-rich region and a large aspargine-repeat region. This gene corresponds to a previously reported myosin II heavy chain kinase designated myosin heavy chain-protein kinase C (MHC-PKC), but our analysis clearly demonstrates that this protein does not, as suggested by earlier data, contain a protein kinase catalytic domain. A FLAG-tagged version of DgkA expressed in Dictyostelium displayed robust DGK activity. Earlier studies indicating that disruption of this locus alters myosin II assembly levels in Dictyostelium raise the intriguing possibility that DG and/or PA metabolism may play a role in controlling myosin II assembly in this system.",

Myosin II contributes to wound pore closure by interacting with actin filaments in larger cells; however, its role in smaller cells is unclear. In this study, we observed wound repair in dividing cells for the first time. The cell membrane in the cleavage furrow, where myosin II localized, was wounded by laserporation. Upon wounding, actin transiently accumulated, and myosin II transiently disappeared from the wound site. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the external medium triggered both actin and myosin II dynamics. Inhibition of calmodulin reduced both actin and myosin II dynamics. The wound closure time in myosin II-null cells was the same as that in wild-type cells, suggesting that myosin II is not essential for wound repair. We also found that disassembly of myosin II filaments by phosphorylation did not contribute to their disappearance, indicating a novel mechanism for myosin II delocalization from the cortex. Furthermore, we observed that several furrow-localizing proteins such as GAPA, PakA, myosin heavy chain kinase C, PTEN, and dynamin disappeared upon wounding. Herein, we discuss the possible mechanisms of myosin dynamics during wound repair.",

The activating role of actin on product release and force generation is well documented; however, the communication paths associated with weak-to-strong transitions are poorly characterized. With the aid of mutant analyses based on kinetic investigations and simulations, we identified the W-helix as an important hub coupling the structural changes of switch elements during ATP hydrolysis to temporally controlled interactions with actin that are passed to the central transducer and converter. Disturbing the W-helix/transducer pathway increased actin-activated ATP turnover and reduced motor performance as a consequence of prolonged duration of the strongly actin-attached states. Actin-triggered P<sub>i</sub> release was accelerated, while ADP release considerably decelerated, both limiting maximum ATPase, thus transforming myosin-2 into a high-duty-ratio motor. This kinetic signature of the mutant allowed us to define the fractional occupancies of intermediate states during the ATPase cycle providing evidence that myosin populates a cleft-closure state of strong actin interaction during the weak-to-strong transition with bound hydrolysis products before accomplishing the power stroke.",

Dicty myosin serves as a model system for muscle myosin because of greater ease of mutagenesis, expression, and crystallization. The catalytic domains of these myosins have nearly identical crystal structures in the apo state, but there are significant differences in ATPase kinetics, and there are no crystal structures of skeletal muscle myosin with bound nucleotides, so another structural technique is needed. Previous EPR studies, with a spin label attached to SH1 in muscle myosin, have resolved the key structural states of this region. Therefore, we have performed identical experiments on both myosins spin-labeled at equivalent sites. Spectra were identical for the two myosins in the apo and ADP-bound states. With bound ADP and phosphate analogs, (i) both proteins exhibit two resolved structural states (prepowerstroke, postpowerstroke) in a single biochemical state (defined by the bound nucleotide), and (ii) these structural states are essentially identical in the two myosins but (iii) are occupied to different extents as a function of the biochemical state. We conclude that (i) myosin structural and biochemical states do not have a one-to-one correspondence, and (ii) Dicty myosin can serve as a good analog for structural studies of muscle myosin only if differences in the coupling between biochemical and structural states are taken into account.",

        "abstract": "Coordination of cell movement with cell differentiation is a major feat of embryonic development. The Dictyostelium stalk always forms at the organizing tip, by a mechanism that is not understood. We previously reported that cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), synthesized by diguanylate cyclase A (DgcA), induces stalk formation. Here we used transcriptional profiling of dgca- structures to identify target genes for c-di-GMP, and used these genes to investigate the c-di-GMP signal transduction pathway. We found that knockdown of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in prestalk cells reduced stalk gene induction by c-di-GMP, whereas PKA activation bypassed the c-di-GMP requirement for stalk gene expression. c-di-GMP caused a persistent increase in cAMP, which still occurred in mutants lacking the adenylate cyclases ACG or ACR, or the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA. However, both inhibition of adenylate cyclase A (ACA) with SQ22536 and incubation of a temperature-sensitive ACA mutant at the restrictive temperature prevented c-di-GMP-induced cAMP synthesis as well as c-di-GMP-induced stalk gene transcription. ACA produces the cAMP pulses that coordinate Dictyostelium morphogenetic cell movement and is highly expressed at the organizing tip. The stalk-less dgca- mutant regained its stalk by expression of a light-activated adenylate cyclase from the ACA promoter and exposure to light, indicating that cAMP is also the intermediate for c-di-GMP in vivo. Our data show that the more widely expressed DgcA activates tip-expressed ACA, which then acts on PKA to induce stalk genes. These results explain why stalk formation in Dictyostelia always initiates at the site of the morphogenetic organizer.",

In the case of stress STAT activation is mediated by regulated dephosphorylation; whereby two serine residues on PTP3, the tyrosine phosphatase that de-activates STATc, become phosphorylated after exposure to stress so inhibiting enzymatic activity. We now show that the more highly regulated of the two PTP3 serine residues, S747, is also phosphorylated in response to DIF-1, suggesting a common activation mechanism. Hyper-osmotic stress causes a re-distribution of F-actin to the cortex, cell rounding and shrinkage and we show that DIF-1 induces a similar but transient F-actin re-distribution and rounding response. We also find that two mechanistically distinct inhibitors of actin polymerization, latrunculin A and cytochalasin A induce phosphorylation at S747 of PTP3 and activate STATc. We suggest that PTP3 phosphorylation, and consequent STATc activation, are regulated by changes in F-actin polymerization status during stress and DIF-induced cytoskeletal remodelling.",

        "abstract": "Cytoskeletal dynamics during cell behaviours ranging from endocytosis and exocytosis to cell division and movement is controlled by a complex network of signalling pathways, the full details of which are as yet unresolved. Here we show that SILAC-based proteomic methods can be used to characterize the rapid chemoattractant-induced dynamic changes in the actin-myosin cytoskeleton and regulatory elements on a proteome-wide scale with a second to minute timescale resolution. This approach provides novel insights in the ensemble kinetics of key cytoskeletal constituents and association of known and novel identified binding proteins. We validate the proteomic data by detailed microscopy-based analysis of in vivo translocation dynamics for key signalling factors. This rapid large-scale proteomic approach may be applied to other situations where highly dynamic changes in complex cellular compartments are expected to play a key role.",

        "abstract": "The binding of chemoattractants to cognate G protein-coupled receptors activates a variety of signaling cascades that provide spatial and temporal cues required for chemotaxis. When subjected to uniform stimulation, these responses are transient, showing an initial peak of activation followed by a period of adaptation, in which activity subsides even in the presence of stimulus. A tightly regulated balance between receptor-mediated stimulatory and inhibitory pathways controls the kinetics of activation and subsequent adaptation. In Dictyostelium, the adenylyl cyclase expressed during aggregation (ACA), which synthesizes the chemoattractant cAMP, is essential to relay the signal to neighboring cells. Here, we report that cells lacking phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity are deficient in signal relay. In LY294002-treated cells, this defect is because of a loss of ACA activation. In contrast, in cells lacking PI3K1 and PI3K2, the signal relay defect is because of a loss of ACA adaptation. We propose that the residual low level of 3-phosphoinositides in pi3k(1-/2-) cells is sufficient to generate the initial peak of ACA activity, yet is insufficient to sustain the inhibitory phase required for its adaptation. Thus, PI3K activity is poised to regulate both ACA activation and adaptation, thereby providing a link to ensure the proper balance of counteracting signals required to maintain optimal chemoresponsiveness.",

        "abstract": "Small chemotactic cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils transduce shallow spatial chemoattractant gradients into strongly localized intracellular responses. We show that the capacity of a second messenger to establish and maintain localized signals, is mainly determined by its dispersion range, lambda = the square root of D(m)/k(-1), which must be small compared to the cell's length. Therefore, short-living second messengers (high k(-1)) with diffusion coefficients D(m) in the range of 0-5 microm(2) s(-1) are most suitable. Additional to short dispersion ranges, gradient sensing may include positive feedback mechanisms that lead to local activation and global inhibition of second-messenger production. To introduce the essential nonlinear amplification, we have investigated models in which one or more components of the signal transduction cascade translocate from the cytosol to the second messenger in the plasma membrane. A one-component model is able to amplify a 1.5-fold difference of receptor activity over the cell length into a 15-fold difference of second-messenger concentration. Amplification can be improved considerably by introducing an additional activating component that translocates to the membrane. In both models, communication between the front and the back of the cell is mediated by partial depletion of cytosolic components, which leads to both local activation and global inhibition. The results suggest that a biochemically simple and general mechanism may explain various signal localization phenomena not only in chemotactic cells but also those occurring in morphogenesis and cell differentiation.",

We deduce a minimal dynamical model that reproduces the statistical features of experimental trajectories. These are trajectories of the centroid of the cell perimeter, which is more sensitive to pseudopod activity than the usual tracking by centroid or nucleus. Our data account for cell individuality and dictate a model that extends the cell-type specific models recently derived for mammalian cells. Two generalized Langevin equations model stochastic periodic pseudopod motion parallel and orthogonal to the amoeba's direction of motion. This motion propels the amoeba with a random periodic left-right waddle in a direction that has a long persistence time. The model fully accounts for the statistics of the experimental trajectories, including velocity power spectra and auto-correlations, non-Gaussian velocity distributions, and multiplicative noise. Thus, we find neither need nor place in our data for an interpretation in terms of anomalous diffusion. The model faithfully captures cell individuality as different parameter values in the model, and serves as a basis for integrating the local mechanics of cell motion with our observed long-term behavior.",

To address this difficult question, we have sequenced 1,280 expressed sequence tags from Mastigamoeba balamuthi and assembled a large data set containing 123 genes for representatives of three phenotypically highly divergent major amoeboid lineages: Pelobionta, Entamoebidae, and Mycetozoa. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed on approximately 25,000 aa positions for 30 species by using maximum-likelihood approaches. All well-established eukaryotic groups were recovered with high statistical support, validating our approach. Interestingly, the three amoeboid lineages strongly clustered together in agreement with the Conosa hypothesis [as defined by T. Cavalier-Smith (1998) Biol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 73, 203-266]. Two amitochondriate amoebae, the free-living Mastigamoeba and the human parasite Entamoeba, formed a significant sister group to the exclusion of the mycetozoan Dictyostelium. This result suggested that a part of the reductive process in the evolution of Entamoeba (e.g., loss of typical mitochondria) occurred in its free-living ancestors. Applying this inexpensive expressed sequence tag approach to many other lineages will surely improve our understanding of eukaryotic evolution.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium is the only non-metazoan with functionally analyzed SH2 domains and studying them can give insights into their evolution and wider potential. LrrB has a novel domain configuration with leucine-rich repeat, 14-3-3 and SH2 protein-protein interaction modules. It is required for the correct expression of several specific genes in early development and here we characterize its role in later, multicellular development. During development in the light, slug formation in LrrB null (lrrB-) mutants is delayed relative to the parental strain, and the slugs are highly defective in phototaxis and thermotaxis. In the dark the mutant arrests development as an elongated mound, in a hitherto unreported process we term dark stalling. The developmental and phototaxis defects are cell autonomous and marker analysis shows that the pstO prestalk sub-region of the slug is aberrant in the lrrB- mutant. Expression profiling, by parallel micro-array and deep RNA sequence analyses, reveals many other alterations in prestalk-specific gene expression in lrrB- slugs, including reduced expression of the ecmB gene and elevated expression of ampA. During culmination ampA is ectopically expressed in the stalk, there is no expression of ampA and ecmB in the lower cup and the mutant fruiting bodies lack a basal disc. The basal disc cup derives from the pstB cells and this population is greatly reduced in the lrrB- mutant. This anatomical feature is a hallmark of mutants aberrant in signaling by DIF-1, the polyketide that induces prestalk and stalk cell differentiation. In a DIF-1 induction assay the lrrB- mutant is profoundly defective in ecmB activation but only marginally defective in ecmA induction. Thus the mutation partially uncouples these two inductive events. In early development LrrB interacts physically and functionally with CldA, another SH2 domain containing protein. However, the CldA null mutant does not phenocopy the lrrB- in its aberrant multicellular development or phototaxis defect, implying that the early and late functions of LrrB are affected in different ways. These observations, coupled with its domain structure, suggest that LrrB is an SH2 adaptor protein active in diverse developmental signaling pathways.",

Here, we study dormancy in different eukaryotic organisms and find it to be associated with a significant decrease in the mobility of organelles and foreign tracer particles. We show that this reduced mobility is caused by an influx of protons and a marked acidification of the cytoplasm, which leads to widespread macromolecular assembly of proteins and triggers a transition of the cytoplasm to a solid-like state with increased mechanical stability. We further demonstrate that this transition is required for cellular survival under conditions of starvation. Our findings have broad implications for understanding alternative physiological states, such as quiescence and dormancy, and create a new view of the cytoplasm as an adaptable fluid that can reversibly transition into a protective solid-like state.",

Engineered mutations K84M and R704E in <i>Dictyostelium</i> myosin have been designed to specifically inhibit the recovery stroke and have been shown to indirectly affect the ATPase activity of myosin. We investigated these mutagenic perturbations to the recovery stroke and generated thermodynamically correct and unbiased trajectories for native ATP hydrolysis with computationally enhanced sampling methods. Our methodology was able to resolve experimentally observed changes to kinetic and equilibrium dynamics for the recovery stroke with the correct prediction in the severity of these changes. For ATP hydrolysis, the sequential nature along with the stabilization of a metaphosphate intermediate was observed in agreement with previous studies. However, we observed glutamate 459 being utilized as a proton abstractor to prime the attacking water instead of a lytic water, a phenomenon not well categorized in myosin but has in other ATPases. Both rare event methodologies can be extended to human myosin to investigate isoformic differences from <i>Dictyostelium</i> and scan cardiomyopathic mutations to see differential perturbations to kinetics of other conformational changes in myosin such as the power stroke.",

        "abstract": "Cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs) have a primary role in O(2) sensing in animals via modification of the transcriptional factor subunit HIF\u03b1, resulting in its polyubiquitination by the E3(VHL)ubiquitin (Ub) ligase and degradation in the 26 S proteasome. Previously thought to be restricted to animals, a homolog (P4H1) of HIF\u03b1-type PHDs is expressed in the social amoeba Dictyostelium where it also exhibits characteristics of an O(2) sensor for development. Dictyostelium lacks HIF\u03b1, and P4H1 modifies a different protein, Skp1, an adaptor of the SCF class of E3-Ub ligases related to the E3(VHL)Ub ligase that targets animal HIF\u03b1. Normally, the HO-Skp1 product of the P4H1 reaction is capped by a GlcNAc sugar that can be subsequently extended to a pentasaccharide by novel glycosyltransferases. To analyze the role of glycosylation, the Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase locus gnt1 was modified with a missense mutation to block catalysis or a stop codon to truncate the protein. Despite the accumulation of the hydroxylated form of Skp1, Skp1 was not destabilized based on metabolic labeling. However, hydroxylation alone allowed for partial correction of the high O(2) requirement of P4H1-null cells, therefore revealing both glycosylation-independent and glycosylation-dependent roles for hydroxylation. Genetic complementation of the latter function required an enzymatically active form of Gnt1. Because the effect of the gnt1 deficiency depended on P4H1, and Skp1 was the only protein labeled when the GlcNAc-transferase was restored to mutant extracts, Skp1 apparently mediates the cellular functions of both P4H1 and Gnt1. Although Skp1 stability itself is not affected by hydroxylation, its modification may affect the stability of targets of Skp1-dependent Ub ligases.",

Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HelF protein was localized in speckles in the nucleus. Disruption of the helF gene resulted in a mutant morphology in late development. When transformed with RNAi constructs, HelF- cells displayed enhanced RNA interference on four tested genes. One gene that could not be knocked-down in the wild-type background was efficiently silenced in the mutant. Furthermore, the efficiency of silencing in the wild-type was dramatically improved when helF was disrupted in a secondary transformation. Silencing efficiency depended on transcription levels of hairpin RNA and the threshold was dramatically reduced in HelF- cells. However, the amount of siRNA did not depend on hairpin transcription. HelF is thus a natural nuclear suppressor of RNA interference. In contrast, no improvement of gene silencing was observed when mutant cells were challenged with corresponding antisense constructs. This indicates that RNAi and antisense have distinct requirements even though they may share parts of their pathways.",

Here we show that a different circularly permuted GTPase domain actually does exist, conforming to the pattern G3-G4-G5-G1-G2. The domain, dubbed cpRAS, is a variant of RAS family GTPases and occurs in two types of larger proteins, either inserted into a region homologous to a bacterial group of proteins classified as COG2373 and potentially related to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family (so far a single protein in Dictyostelium) or in combination with a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain. For the latter protein type, which was found in a few metazoans and several distantly related protists, existence in the common ancestor of opisthokonts, Amoebozoa and excavates followed by at least eight independent losses may be inferred.

Here, using electron microscopy and image processing of tagged and truncated Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein constructs, we show that the heart of the motor is a hexameric ring of AAA+ modules, with the stalk emerging opposite the primary ATPase site (AAA1). The C-terminal region is not an integral part of the ring but spans between AAA6 and near the stalk base. The N-terminal region includes a lever-like linker whose N terminus swings by approximately 17 nm during the ATPase cycle between AAA2 and the stalk base. Together with evidence of stalk tilting, which may communicate changes in microtubule binding affinity, these findings suggest a model for dynein's structure and mechanism.",

Here we developed an in vitro single-molecule imaging assay with various lipid compositions and use it to demonstrate that the enzymatic product, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, stabilizes PTEN's membrane-binding. The dissociation kinetics and lateral mobility of PTEN depended on the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> density on artificial lipid bilayers. The basic residues of PTEN were responsible for electrostatic interactions with anionic PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and thus the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent stabilization.

        "abstract": "Kinesin and dynein are fundamental components of intracellular transport, but their interactions when simultaneously present on cargos are unknown. We built an optical trap that can be calibrated in vivo during data acquisition for each individual cargo to measure forces in living cells. Comparing directional stall forces in vivo and in vitro, we found evidence that cytoplasmic dynein is active during minus- and plus-end directed motion, whereas kinesin is only active in the plus direction. In vivo, we found outward (\u223cplus-end) stall forces range from 2 to 7 pN, which is significantly less than the 5- to 7-pN stall force measured in vitro for single kinesin molecules. In vitro measurements on beads with kinesin-1 and dynein bound revealed a similar distribution, implying that an interaction between opposite polarity motors causes this difference. Finally, inward (\u223cminus-end) stalls in vivo were 2-3 pN, which is higher than the 1.1-pN stall force of a single dynein, implying multiple active dynein.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium amoebae accomplish a starvation-induced developmental process by aggregating into a mound and forming a single fruiting body with terminally differentiated spores and stalk cells. culB was identified as the gene disrupted in a developmental mutant with an aberrant prestalk cell differentiation phenotype. The culB gene product appears to be a homolog of the cullin family of proteins that are known to be involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The culB mutants form supernumerary prestalk tips atop each developing mound that result in the formation of multiple small fruiting bodies. The prestalk-specific gene ecmA is expressed precociously in culB mutants, suggesting that prestalk cell differentiation occurs earlier than normal. In addition, when culB mutant cells are mixed with wild-type cells, they display a cell-autonomous propensity to form stalk cells. Thus, CulB appears to ensure that the proper number of prestalk cells differentiate at the appropriate time in development. Activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by disruption of the regulatory subunit gene (pkaR) or by overexpression of the catalytic subunit gene (pkaC) enhances the prestalk/stalk cell differentiation phenotype of the culB mutant. For example, culB- pkaR- cells form stalk cells without obvious multicellular morphogenesis and are more sensitive to the prestalk O (pstO) cell inducer DIF-1. The sensitized condition of PKA activation reveals that CulB may govern prestalk cell differentiation in Dictyostelium, in part by controlling the sensitivity of cells to DIF-1, possibly by regulating the levels of one or more proteins that are rate limiting for prestalk differentiation.",

        "abstract": "WASP family proteins are key players for connecting multiple signaling pathways to F-actin polymerization. To dissect the highly integrated signaling pathways controlling WASP activity, we identified a Rac protein that binds to the GTPase binding domain of WASP. Using two-hybrid and FRET-based functional assays, we identified RacC as a major regulator of WASP. RacC stimulates F-actin assembly in cell-free systems in a WASP-dependent manner. A FRET-based microscopy approach showed local activation of RacC at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. Cells overexpressing RacC exhibit a significant increase in the level of F-actin polymerization upon cAMP stimulation, which can be blocked by a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor. Membrane translocation of PI 3-kinase and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate reporter is absent in racC null cells. Cells overexpressing dominant negative RacC mutants and racC null cells move at a significantly slower speed and show a poor directionality during chemotaxis. Our results suggest that RacC plays an important role in PI 3-kinase activation and WASP activation for dynamic regulation of F-actin assembly during Dictyostelium chemotaxis.",

        "abstract": "How myosin II localizes to the cleavage furrow in Dictyostelium and metazoan cells remains largely unknown despite significant advances in understanding its regulation. We designed a genetic selection using cDNA library suppression of 3xAsp myosin II to identify factors involved in myosin cleavage furrow accumulation. The 3xAsp mutant is deficient in bipolar thick filament assembly, fails to accumulate at the cleavage furrow, cannot rescue myoII-null cytokinesis, and has impaired mechanosensitive accumulation. Eleven genes suppressed this dominant cytokinesis deficiency when 3xAsp was expressed in wild-type cells. 3xAsp myosin II's localization to the cleavage furrow was rescued by constructs encoding rcdBB, mmsdh, RMD1, actin, one novel protein, and a 14-3-3 hairpin. Further characterization showed that RMD1 is required for myosin II cleavage furrow accumulation, acting in parallel with mechanical stress. Analysis of several mutant strains revealed that different thresholds of myosin II activity are required for daughter cell symmetry than for furrow ingression dynamics. Finally, an engineered myosin II with a longer lever arm (2xELC), producing a highly mechanosensitive motor, could also partially suppress the intragenic 3xAsp. Overall, myosin II accumulation is the result of multiple parallel and partially redundant pathways that comprise a cellular contractility control system.",

        "abstract": "The lamellipodia and pseudopodia of migrating cells are produced and maintained by the Scar/WAVE complex. Thus, actin-based cell migration is largely controlled through regulation of Scar/WAVE. Here, we report that the Abi subunit-but not Scar-is phosphorylated in response to extracellular signalling in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. Like Scar, Abi is phosphorylated after the complex has been activated, implying that Abi phosphorylation modulates pseudopodia, rather than causing new ones to be made. Consistent with this, Scar complex mutants that cannot bind Rac are also not phosphorylated. Several environmental cues also affect Abi phosphorylation-cell-substrate adhesion promotes it and increased extracellular osmolarity diminishes it. Both unphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Abi efficiently rescue the chemotaxis of Abi KO cells and pseudopodia formation, confirming that Abi phosphorylation is not required for activation or inactivation of the Scar/WAVE complex. However, pseudopodia and Scar patches in the cells with unphosphorylatable Abi protrude for longer, altering pseudopod dynamics and cell speed. <i>Dictyostelium</i>, in which Scar and Abi are both unphosphorylatable, can still form pseudopods, but migrate substantially faster. We conclude that extracellular signals and environmental responses modulate cell migration by tuning the behaviour of the Scar/WAVE complex after it has been activated.",

        "abstract": "Starvation of Dictyostelium induces a developmental program in which cells form an aggregate that eventually differentiates into a multicellular structure. The aggregate formation is mediated by directional migration of individual cells that quickly transition to group migration in which cells align in a head-to-tail manner to form streams. Cyclic AMP acts as a chemoattractant and its production, secretion, and degradation are highly regulated. A key protein is the extracellular phosphodiesterase PdsA. In this study we examine the role and localization of PdsA during chemotaxis and streaming. We find that pdsA(-) cells respond chemotactically to a narrower range of chemoattractant concentrations compared with wild-type (WT) cells. Moreover, unlike WT cells, pdsA(-) cells do not form streams at low cell densities and form unusual thick and transient streams at high cell densities. We find that the intracellular pool of PdsA is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which may provide a compartment for storage and secretion of PdsA. Because we find that cAMP synthesis is normal in cells lacking PdsA, we conclude that signal degradation regulates the external cAMP gradient field generation and that the group migration behavior of these cells is compromised even though their signaling machinery is intact.",

        "abstract": "Cullin-ring-ligases mediate protein polyubiquitination, a signal for degradation in the 26S proteasome. The CRL1 class consists of Skp1/cullin-1/F-box protein/Rbx1 (SCF) complexes that cyclically associate with ubiquitin-E2 to build the polyubiquitin chain. Within the SCF complex, the 162-amino acid DdSkp1 from Dictyostelium bridges cullin-1 with an F-box protein (FBP), the specificity factor for substrate selection. The hydroxylation-dependent glycosylation of Pro143 of DdSkp1 by a pentasaccharide forms the basis of a novel O<sub>2</sub>-sensing mechanism in the social amoeba Dictyostelium and other protists. Previous evidence indicated that glycosylation promotes increased \u03b1-helical content correlating with enhanced interaction with three F-box proteins. To localize these differences, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to compare nonglycosylated DdSkp1 and a glycoform with a single GlcNAc sugar (Gn-DdSkp1). We report NMR assignments of backbone <sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup>, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>\u03b1</sup>, and <sup>13</sup>CO nuclei as well as side-chain <sup>13</sup>C<sup>\u03b2</sup> and methyl <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>1</sup>H nuclei of Ile(\u03b41), Leu, and Val in both unmodified DdSkp1 and Gn-DdSkp1. The random coil index and <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} HNOE indicate that the C-terminal region, which forms a helix-loop-helix motif centered on Pro143 at the crystallographically defined binding interface with F-box domains, remains dynamic in both DdSkp1 and Gn-DdSkp1. Chemical shifts indicate that the variation of conformation in Gn-DdSkp1, relative to DdSkp1, is limited to this region and characterized by increased helical fold. Extension of the glycan chain results in further changes, also limited to this region. Thus, glycosylation may control F-box protein interactions via a local effect on DdSkp1 conformation, by a mechanism that may be general to many unicellular eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "Streams of migratory cells are initiated by the formation of tandem pairs of cells connected head to tail to which other cells subsequently adhere. The mechanisms regulating the transition from single to streaming cell migration remain elusive, although several molecules have been suggested to be involved. In this work, we investigate the mechanics of the locomotion ofDictyosteliumtandem pairs by analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of their traction adhesions (TAs). We find that in migrating wild-type tandem pairs, each cell exerts traction forces on stationary sites (\u223c80% of the time), and the trailing cell reuses the location of the TAs of the leading cell. Both leading and trailing cells form contractile dipoles and synchronize the formation of new frontal TAs with \u223c54-s time delay. Cells not expressing the lectin discoidin I or moving on discoidin I-coated substrata form fewer tandems, but the trailing cell still reuses the locations of the TAs of the leading cell, suggesting that discoidin I is not responsible for a possible chemically driven synchronization process. The migration dynamics of the tandems indicate that their TAs' reuse results from the mechanical synchronization of the leading and trailing cells' protrusions and retractions (motility cycles) aided by the cell-cell adhesions.",

As such, it provides particularly interesting challenges for a combined computational and experimental analysis. We developed a novel detailed molecular signaling model that, when used to simulate the response to the attractant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), made nontrivial predictions about Dictyostelium chemosensing. These predictions, including the unexpected existence of spatially asymmetrical, multiphasic, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-induced PTEN translocation and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)P3 generation, were experimentally verified by quantitative single-cell microscopy leading us to propose significant modifications to the current standard model for chemoattractant-induced biochemical polarization in this organism. Key to this successful modeling effort was the use of \"Simmune,\" a new software package that supports the facile development and testing of detailed computational representations of cellular behavior. An intuitive interface allows user definition of complex signaling networks based on the definition of specific molecular binding site interactions and the subcellular localization of molecules. It automatically translates such inputs into spatially resolved simulations and dynamic graphical representations of the resulting signaling network that can be explored in a manner that closely parallels wet lab experimental procedures. These features of Simmune were critical to the model development and analysis presented here and are likely to be useful in the computational investigation of many aspects of cell biology.",

Furthermore DdCP224, a protein homologous to the microtubule-stabilizing protein TOGp/XMAP215, was absent from the spindle midzone of DdINCENP null cells. Overexpression of DdCP224 rescued the weak spindle midzone defect of DdINCENP null cells. Although not required for the localization of the myosin II contractile ring and subsequent formation of a cleavage furrow, DdINCENP is important for the abscission of daughter cells at the end of cytokinesis.

In Dictyostelium, two guanylyl cyclases and four candidate cGMP-binding proteins (GbpA- GbpD) are implicated in cGMP signalling. GbpA and GbpB are homologous proteins with a Zn2+-hydrolase domain. A double gbpA/gbpB gene disruption leads to a reduction of cGMP-phosphodiesterase activity and a 10-fold increase of basal and stimulated cGMP levels. Chemotaxis in gbpA(-)B(-) cells is associated with increased myosin II phosphorylation compared with wild-type cells; formation of lateral pseudopodia is suppressed resulting in enhanced chemotaxis. GbpC is homologous to GbpD, and contains Ras, MAPKKK and Ras-GEF domains. Inactivation of the gbp genes indicates that only GbpC harbours high affinity cGMP-binding activity. Myosin phosphorylation, assembly of myosin in the cytoskeleton as well as chemotaxis are severely impaired in mutants lacking GbpC and GbpD, or mutants lacking both guanylyl cyclases. Thus, a novel cGMP signalling cascade is critical for chemotaxis in Dictyostelium, and plays a major role in myosin II regulation during this process.",

        "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread weapon employed by Gram-negative bacteria for interspecies interaction in complex communities. Analogous to a contractile phage tail, the double-tubular T6SS injects toxic effectors into prokaryotic and eukaryotic neighboring cells. Although effectors dictate T6SS functions, their identities remain elusive in many pathogens. Here, we report the lysozyme-like effector TseP in Aeromonas dhakensis, a waterborne pathogen that can cause severe gastroenteritis and systemic infection. Using secretion, competition, and enzymatic assays, we demonstrate that TseP is a T6SS-dependent effector with cell wall-lysing activities, and TsiP is its cognate immunity protein. Triple deletion of <i>tseP</i> and two known effector genes, <i>tseI</i> and <i>tseC</i>, abolished T6SS-mediated secretion, while complementation with any single effector gene partially restored bacterial killing and Hcp secretion. In contrast to whole-gene deletions, the triple-effector inactivation in the 3eff<sub>c</sub> mutant abolished antibacterial killing but not T6SS secretion. We further demonstrate that the 3eff<sub>c</sub> mutation abolished T6SS-mediated toxicity of SSU to Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, suggesting that the T6SS physical puncture is nontoxic to eukaryotic cells. These data highlight not only the necessity of possessing functionally diverse effectors for survival in multispecies communities but also that effector inactivation would be an efficient strategy to detoxify the T6SS while preserving its delivery efficiency, converting the T6SS to a platform for protein delivery to a variety of recipient cells. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Delivery of cargo proteins via protein secretion systems has been shown to be a promising tool in various applications. However, secretion systems are often used by pathogens to cause disease. Thus, strategies are needed to detoxify secretion systems while preserving their efficiency. The T6SS can translocate proteins through physical puncture of target cells without specific surface receptors and can target a broad range of recipients. In this study, we identified a cell wall-lysing effector, and by inactivating it and the other two known effectors, we have built a detoxified T6SS-active strain that may be used for protein delivery to prokaryotic and eukaryotic recipient cells.",

        "abstract": "Efficiently introducing molecules such as chemical drugs, proteins, or nucleic acids into cells is a central technique in cell and molecular biology, gene therapy and regenerative medicine. The cell membrane is a critical barrier for this purpose. While many approaches exist, some of which are applicable to single cells that researchers specify under microscopy, no reliable and efficient technique has been invented. In this study, cells were cultured on a coverslip that had been coated with carbon by vapor deposition, and a laser beam was focused on a small local spot beneath a single cell under microscopy. The absorbed energy of the laser beam by the carbon made a pore only in the cell membrane that was attached to the carbon coat, which resulted in an efficient introduction. An inexpensive and lower-power laser could be used for this method, and the introduction efficiency was 100% without any loss of cell viability. This new technique will provide a powerful tool not only to research but also to many applied fields.",

        "abstract": "Cells' ability to detect and orient themselves in chemoattractant gradients has been the subject of numerous studies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown [1]. Ras activation is the earliest polarized response to chemoattractant gradients downstream from heterotrimeric G proteins in Dictyostelium, and inhibition of Ras signaling results in directional migration defects [2]. Activated Ras is enriched at the leading edge, promoting the localized activation of key chemotactic effectors, such as PI3K and TORC2 [2-5]. To investigate the role of Ras in directional sensing, we studied the effect of its misregulation by using cells with disrupted RasGAP activity. We identified an ortholog of mammalian NF1, DdNF1, as a major regulator of Ras activity in Dictyostelium. We show that disruption of nfaA leads to spatially and temporally unregulated Ras activity, causing cytokinesis and chemotaxis defects. By using unpolarized, latrunculin-treated cells, we show that tight regulation of Ras is important for gradient sensing. Together, our findings suggest that Ras is part of the cell's compass and that the RasGAP-mediated regulation of Ras activity affects directional sensing.",

        "abstract": "Protein kinases AKT and PKBR1 of Dictyostelium belong to the AGC protein kinase superfamily. AKT and PKBR1 are phosphorylated at similar sites by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and TORC2 kinases; however, they have different subcellular localizing domains. AKT has a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)]-regulated PH (pleckstrin homology) domain whereas PKBR1 is myristoylated and persistently membrane localized. Using strains defective for PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-, PDK1- and TORC2-signaling or strains that express phospho-site mutants of AKT and PKBR1, we dissect the different roles of PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), PDK1 and TORC2. We show that activation of AKT and PKBR1 requires PDK1-site phosphorylation, but that phosphorylation by TORC2 is insufficient for AKT or PKBR1 activation. However, PDK1-site phosphorylation is dependent on phosphorylation by TORC2, which suggests that there is regulatory coordination among PDK1, TORC2 and their phospho-site targets. This defines a separate input for signaling in control of chemotaxis and dependency on PDK1 function. We also demonstrate that PDK1 in Dictyostelium functions independently of PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3). Finally, we show that AKT and PKBR1 exhibit substrate selectivity and identify two novel lipid-interacting proteins preferentially phosphorylated by AKT. Despite certain similarities, AKT and PKBR1 have distinct regulatory paths that impact activation and effector targeting, with PDK1 serving a central role.",

The filaments of the fusion protein were functionally similar to actin filaments bound with cofilin in that they did not bind rhodamine-phalloidin, had quenched fluorescence of pyrene attached to Cys374 and showed enhanced susceptibility of the DNase loop to cleavage by subtilisin. Quantitative analyses of copolymers made of different ratios of the fusion protein and control actin further demonstrated that the fusion protein affects the structure of multiple neighboring actin subunits in copolymers. Based on these and other recent related studies, we propose a mechanism by which conformational changes induced by cofilin binding is propagated unidirectionally to the pointed ends of the filaments, and cofilin clusters grow unidirectionally to the pointed ends following this path. Interestingly, the fusion protein was unable to copolymerize with control actin at pH 6.5 and low ionic strength, suggesting that the structural difference between the actin moiety in the fusion protein and control actin is pH-sensitive.",

We propose a framework for estimating and interpreting epistasis from a classical experiment that combines the strengths of each approach. A regression analysis step accommodates the quantitative nature of expression measurements by estimating the effect of gene deletions plus any interaction. Effects are selected by significance such that a reduced model describes each expression trait. We show how the resulting models correspond to specific hierarchical relationships between two regulator genes and a target gene. These relationships are the basic units of genetic pathways and genomic system diagrams.

The proper function of this network enables mechanosensation, the ability of cells to sense and respond to mechanical cues. Myosin II and cortexillin I, critical elements of the cellular mechanosensory machinery, preassemble in the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium cells into complexes that we have termed contractility kits (CKs). Two IQGAP proteins then differentially regulate the mechanoresponsiveness of the cortexillin I-myosin II elements within CKs. To investigate the mechanism of CK self-assembly and gain insight into possible molecular means for IQGAP regulation, we developed a coarse-grained excluded volume molecular model in which all protein polymers are represented by nm-sized spheres connected by spring-like links. The model is parameterized using experimentally measured parameters acquired through fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which describe the interaction affinities and diffusion coefficients for individual molecular components, and which have also been validated via several orthogonal methods. Simulations of wild-type and null-mutant conditions implied that the temporal order of assembly of these kits is dominated by myosin II dimer formation and that IQGAP proteins mediate cluster growth. In addition, our simulations predicted the existence of \"ambiguous\" CKs that incorporate both classes of IQGAPs, and we confirmed this experimentally using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. The model serves to describe the formation of the CKs and how their assembly enables and regulates mechanosensation at the molecular level.",

PHCrac-GFP is a green fluorescent protein fused to a PH domain that presumably binds to phosphatydylinositol polyphosphates in the membrane. We determined the relative concentration of PHCrac-GFP in the cytosol and at different places along the cell boundary. In cells stimulated homogeneously with 1microM cAMP we observed two distinct phases of PHCrac-GFP translocation. The first translocation is transient and occurs to nearly the entire boundary of the cell; the response is maximal at 6-8 s after stimulation and disappears after approximately 20 s. A second translocation of PHCrac-GFP starts after approximately 30 s and persists as long as cAMP remains present. Translocation during this second response occurs to small patches with radius of approximately 4-5 microm, each covering approximately 10% of the cell surface. Membrane patches of PHCrac-GFP are both temporally and spatially closely associated with pseudopodia, which are extended at approximately 10 s from the area with a PHCrac-GFP patch. These signaling patches in pseudopodia of homogeneously stimulated cells resemble the single patch of PHCrac-GFP at the leading edge of a cell in a gradient of cAMP, suggesting that PHCrac-GFP is a spatial cue for pseudopod formation also in uniform cAMP.",

        "abstract": "The chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the extracellular environment have a strong effect on cell migration. Aspects such as pore size or stiffness of the matrix influence the selection of the mechanism used by cells to propel themselves, including by pseudopods or blebbing. How a cell perceives its environment and how such a cue triggers a change in behavior are largely unknown, but mechanics is likely to be involved. Because mechanical conditions are often controlled by modifying the composition of the environment, separating chemical and physical contributions is difficult and requires multiple controls. Here we propose a simple method to impose a mechanical compression on individual cells without altering the composition of the matrix. Live imaging during compression provides accurate information about the cell's morphology and migratory phenotype. Using <i>Dictyostelium</i> as a model, we observe that a compression of the order of 500 Pa flattens the cells under gel by up to 50%. This uniaxial compression directly triggers a transition in the mode of migration from primarily pseudopodial to bleb driven in <30 s. This novel device is therefore capable of influencing cell migration in real time and offers a convenient approach with which to systematically study mechanotransduction in confined environments.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis, the chemically guided movement of cells, plays an important role in several biological processes including cancer, wound healing, and embryogenesis. Chemotacting cells are able to sense shallow chemical gradients where the concentration of chemoattractant differs by only a few percent from one side of the cell to the other, over a wide range of local concentrations. Exactly what limits the chemotactic ability of these cells is presently unclear. Here we determine the chemotactic response of Dictyostelium cells to exponential gradients of varying steepness and local concentration of the chemoattractant cAMP. We find that the cells are sensitive to the steepness of the gradient as well as to the local concentration. Using information theory techniques, we derive a formula for the mutual information between the input gradient and the spatial distribution of bound receptors and also compute the mutual information between the input gradient and the motility direction in the experiments. A comparison between these quantities reveals that for shallow gradients, in which the concentration difference between the back and the front of a 10-mum-diameter cell is <5%, and for small local concentrations (<10 nM) the intracellular information loss is insignificant. Thus, external fluctuations due to the finite number of receptors dominate and limit the chemotactic response. For steeper gradients and higher local concentrations, the intracellular information processing is suboptimal and results in a smaller mutual information between the input gradient and the motility direction than would have been predicted from the ligand-receptor binding process.",

When bacterial prey is in short supply or depleted, they undergo multicellular development culminating in the formation of dormant spores. In this work, we tested isolates representing four dictyostelid species from two genera (Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium) for the potential to feed on biofilms preformed on glass and polycarbonate surfaces. The abilities of dictyostelids were monitored for three hallmarks of activity: 1) spore germination on biofilms, 2) predation on biofilm enmeshed bacteria by phagocytic cells and 3) characteristic stages of multicellular development (streaming and fructification). We found that all dictyostelid isolates tested could feed on biofilm enmeshed bacteria produced by human and plant pathogens: Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia amylovora 1189 (biofilm former) and E. amylovora 1189 \u0394ams (biofilm deficient mutant). However, when dictyostelids were fed planktonic E. amylovora \u0394ams the bacterial cells exhibited an increased susceptibility to predation by one of the two dictyostelid strains they were tested against. Taken together, the qualitative and quantitative data presented here suggest that dictyostelids have preferences in bacterial prey which affects their efficiency of feeding on bacterial biofilms.",

Recent work shows that shallow chemoattractant gradients do not induce the generation of pseudopods, as has been predicted in many models. This poses the question of how else cells can steer towards chemoattractants. Here we use a new computational algorithm to analyze the extension of pseudopods by Dictyostelium cells. We show that a shallow gradient of cAMP induces a small bias in the direction of pseudopod extension, without significantly affecting parameters such as pseudopod frequency or size. Persistent movement, caused by alternating left/right splitting of existing pseudopodia, amplifies the effects of this bias by up to 5-fold. Known players in chemotactic pathways play contrasting parts in this mechanism; PLA2 and cGMP signal to the cytoskeleton to regulate the splitting process, while PI 3-kinase and soluble guanylyl cyclase mediate the directional bias. The coordinated regulation of pseudopod generation, orientation and persistence by multiple signaling pathways allows eukaryotic cells to detect extremely shallow gradients.",

No permeability to the solutes glycerol or urea was observed. Pre-treatment of EcAQP-expressing oocytes with HgCl(2) failed to inhibit their osmotic permeability, as predicted from EcAQP's lack of mercury-sensitive cysteine residues near the NPA motifs which line the AQP aqueous pore.

        "abstract": "F-actin structures and their distribution are important determinants of the dynamic shapes and functions of eukaryotic cells. Actin waves are F-actin formations that move along the ventral cell membrane driven by actin polymerization. Dictyostelium myosin IB is associated with actin waves but its role in the wave is unknown. Myosin IB is a monomeric, non-filamentous myosin with a globular head that binds to F-actin and has motor activity, and a non-helical tail comprising a basic region, a glycine-proline-glutamine-rich region and an SH3-domain. The basic region binds to acidic phospholipids in the plasma membrane through a short basic-hydrophobic site and the Gly-Pro-Gln region binds F-actin. In the current work we found that both the basic-hydrophobic site in the basic region and the Gly-Pro-Gln region of the tail are required for the association of myosin IB with actin waves. This is the first evidence that the Gly-Pro-Gln region is required for localization of myosin IB to a specific actin structure in situ. The head is not required for myosin IB association with actin waves but binding of the head to F-actin strengthens the association of myosin IB with waves and stabilizes waves. Neither the SH3-domain nor motor activity is required for association of myosin IB with actin waves. We conclude that myosin IB contributes to anchoring actin waves to the plasma membranes by binding of the basic-hydrophobic site to acidic phospholipids in the plasma membrane and binding of the Gly-Pro-Gln region to F-actin in the wave.",

        "abstract": "Asymmetric protein localization is essential for cell polarity and migration. We report a novel protein, Callipygian (CynA), which localizes to the lagging edge before other proteins and becomes more tightly restricted as cells polarize; additionally, it accumulates in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. CynA protein that is tightly localized, or \"clustered,\" to the cell rear is immobile, but when polarity is disrupted, it disperses throughout the membrane and responds to uniform chemoattractant stimulation by transiently localizing to the cytosol. These behaviors require a pleckstrin homology-domain membrane tether and a WD40 clustering domain, which can also direct other membrane proteins to the back. Fragments of CynA lacking the pleckstrin homology domain, which are normally found in the cytosol, localize to the lagging edge membrane when coexpressed with full-length protein, showing that CynA clustering is mediated by oligomerization. Cells lacking CynA have aberrant lateral protrusions, altered leading-edge morphology, and decreased directional persistence, whereas those overexpressing the protein display exaggerated features of polarity. Consistently, actin polymerization is inhibited at sites of CynA accumulation, thereby restricting protrusions to the opposite edge. We suggest that the mutual antagonism between CynA and regions of responsiveness creates a positive feedback loop that restricts CynA to the rear and contributes to the establishment of the cell axis.",

        "abstract": "Hirano bodies are paracrystalline F-actin-rich structures associated with diverse conditions, including neurodegeneration and aging. Generation of model Hirano bodies using altered forms of Dictyostelium 34-kDa actin-bundling protein allows studies of their physiological function and mechanism of formation. We describe a novel 34-kDa protein mutant, E60K, with a point mutation within the inhibitory domain of the 34-kDa protein. Expression of E60K in Dictyostelium induces the formation of model Hirano bodies. The E60K protein has activated actin binding and is calcium regulated, unlike other forms of the 34-kDa protein that induce Hirano bodies and that have activated actin binding but lack calcium regulation. Actin filaments in the presence of E60K in vitro show enhanced resistance to disassembly induced by latrunculin B. Actin filaments in model Hirano bodies are also protected from latrunculin-induced depolymerization. We used nocodazole and blebbistatin to probe the role of the microtubules and myosin II, respectively, in the formation of model Hirano bodies. In the presence of these inhibitors, model Hirano bodies can form but are smaller than controls at early times of formation. The ultrastructure of model Hirano bodies did not reveal any major difference in structure and organization in the presence of inhibitors. In summary, these results support the conclusion that formation of model Hirano bodies is promoted by gain-of-function actin filament bundling, which enhances actin filament stabilization. Microtubules and myosin II contribute to but are not required for formation of model Hirano bodies.",

Immunoprecipitation of lysates of KnkA-YFP-transformed <i>knkA<sup>-</sup></i> cells yielded a mammalian BCAS3 homolog as a KnkA interactor. <i>bcas3<sup>-</sup></i> phenocopied <i>knkA<sup>-</sup></i> and Bcas3 colocalized with KnkA to puncta.

KnkA puncta also colocalized with small but not large vesicles that contain the autophagy protein Atg8 and were contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum. <i>knkA<sup>-</sup></i> and <i>bcas3<sup>-</sup></i> cells showed a pronounced decrease of RFP-GFP-Atg8 in neutral early autophagosomes, indicating that KnkA and Bcas3 are required for macroautophagy/autophagy.

        "abstract": "Cell death occurs in all eukaryotes, but it is still not known whether some core steps of the cell death process are conserved. We investigated this using the protist Dictyostelium. The dissection of events in Dictyostelium vacuolar developmental cell death was facilitated by the sequential requirement for two distinct exogenous signals. An initial exogenous signal (starvation and cAMP) recruited some cells into clumps. Only within these clumps did subsequent cell death events take place. Contrary to our expectations, already this initial signal provoked nucleolar disorganization and irreversible inhibition of rRNA and DNA synthesis, reflecting marked cell dysfunction. The initial signal also primed clumped cells to respond to a second exogenous signal (differentiation-inducing factor-1 or c-di-GMP), which led to vacuolization and synthesis of cellulose encasings. Thus, the latter prominent hallmarks of developmental cell death were induced separately from initial cell dysfunction. We propose that (1) in Dictyostelium vacuolization and cellulose encasings are late, organism-specific, hallmarks, and (2) on the basis of our observations in this protist and of similar previous observations in some cases of mammalian cell death, early inhibition of rRNA synthesis and nucleolar disorganization may be conserved in some eukaryotes to usher in developmental cell death.",

        "abstract": "In response to a variety of external cues, eukaryotic cells display varied migratory modes to perform their physiological functions during development and in the adult. Aberrations in cell migration result in embryonic defects and cancer metastasis. The molecular components involved in cell migration are remarkably conserved between the social amoeba Dictyostelium and mammalian cells. This makes the amoeba an excellent model system for studies of eukaryotic cell migration. These migration-associated components can be grouped into three networks: input, signal transduction and cytoskeletal. In migrating cells, signal transduction events such as Ras or PI3K activity occur at the protrusion tips, referred to as 'front', whereas events such as dissociation of PTEN from these regions are referred to as 'back'. Asymmetric distribution of such front and back events is crucial for establishing polarity and guiding cell migration. The triggering of these signaling events displays properties of biochemical excitability including all-or-nothing responsiveness to suprathreshold stimuli, refractoriness, and wave propagation. These signal transduction waves originate from a point and propagate towards the edge of the cell, thereby driving cytoskeletal activity and cellular protrusions. Any change in the threshold for network activation alters the range of the propagating waves and the size of cellular protrusions which gives rise to various migratory modes in cells. Thus, this review highlights excitable signal transduction networks as key players for coordinating cytoskeletal activities to drive cell migration in all eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "The role of PI(3,4,5)P(3) in Dictyostelium signal transduction and chemotaxis was investigated using the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and pi3k-null cells. The increase of PI(3,4,5)P(3) levels after stimulation with the chemoattractant cAMP was blocked >95% by 60 microM LY294002 with half-maximal effect at 5 microM. This correlated well with the inhibition of the membrane translocation of the PH-domain protein, PHcracGFP. LY294002 did not reduce cAMP-mediated cGMP production, but significantly reduced the cAMP response up to 75% in wild type and completely in pi3k-null cells. LY294002-treated cells were round, not elongated as control cells. Interestingly, cAMP induced a time and dose-dependent recovery of cell elongation. These elongated LY294002-treated wild-type and pi3k-null cells exhibited chemotactic orientation toward cAMP that is statistically identical to chemotactic orientation of control cells. In control cells, PHcrac-GFP and F-actin colocalize upon cAMP stimulation. However, inhibition of PI3-kinases does not affect the first phase of the actin polymerization at a wide range of chemoattractant concentrations. Our data show that severe inhibition of cAMP-mediated PI(3,4,5)P(3) accumulation leads to inhibition of cAMP relay, cell elongation and cell aggregation, but has no detectable effect on chemotactic orientation, provided that cAMP had sufficient time to induce cell elongation.",

Here we report an autoinhibited conformation for the \u03b1-kinase domain of Dictyostelium myosin-II heavy chain kinase A (MHCK-A) in which nucleotide binding to the catalytic cleft, located at the interface between an N-terminal and C-terminal lobe, is sterically blocked by the side chain of a conserved arginine residue (Arg592). Previous \u03b1-kinase structures have shown that an invariant catalytic aspartic acid residue (Asp766) is phosphorylated. Unexpectedly, in the autoinhibited conformation the phosphoryl group is transferred to the adjacent Asp663, creating an interaction network that stabilizes the autoinhibited state. The results suggest that Asp766 phosphorylation may play both catalytic and regulatory roles. The autoinhibited structure also provides the first view of a phosphothreonine residue docked into the phospho-specific allosteric binding site (Pi-pocket) in the C-lobe of the \u03b1-kinase domain.",

We describe here the application of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene modification in Dictyostelium. The endogenous tRNA-processing system for expressing sgRNA was approximately 10 times more effective than the commonly used U6 promoter. The resulting sgRNA affected the sub-nuclear localisation of Cas9, indicating that the expression level of sgRNA was sufficiently high to form Cas9 and sgRNA complexes within the nucleus. The all-in-one vector containing Cas9 and sgRNA was transiently expressed to generate mutants in five PI3K genes. Mutation detective PCR revealed the mutagenesis frequency of the individual genes to be between 72.9% and 100%. We confirmed that all five targeting loci in the four independent clones had insertion/deletion mutations in their target sites. Thus, we show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used in Dictyostelium cells to enable efficient genome editing of multiple genes. Since this system utilises transient expression of the all-in-one vector, it has the advantage that the drug resistance cassette is not integrated into the genome and simple vector construction, involving annealing two oligo-DNAs.",

Despite their importance in migration, as well as in particle and liquid ingestion, how their dynamics are affected by micrometer-scale features of the contact surface is still poorly understood. Here, through quantitative image analysis of <i>Dictyostelium</i> on microfabricated surfaces, we show that there is a distinct mode of topographical guidance directed by the macropinocytic membrane cup. Unlike other topographical guidance known to date that depends on nanometer-scale curvature sensing protein or stress fibers, the macropinocytic membrane cup is driven by the Ras/PI3K/F-actin signaling patch and its dependency on the micrometer-scale topographical features, namely PI3K/F-actin-independent accumulation of Ras-GTP at the convex curved surface, PI3K-dependent patch propagation along the convex edge, and its actomyosin-dependent constriction at the concave edge. Mathematical model simulations demonstrate that the topographically dependent initiation, in combination with the mutually defining patch patterning and the membrane deformation, gives rise to the topographical guidance. Our results suggest that the macropinocytic cup is a self-enclosing structure that can support liquid ingestion by default; however, in the presence of structured surfaces, it is directed to faithfully trace bent and bifurcating ridges for particle ingestion and cell guidance.",

The full complement of actin assembly factors driving cortex formation and how their activities are spatiotemporally regulated remain to be fully elucidated. Using Dictyostelium as a model for polarized and rapidly migrating cells, we show that GxcM, a RhoGEF localized specifically in the rear of migrating cells, functions together with F-BAR protein Fbp17, a small GTPase RacC, and the actin nucleation-promoting factor WASP to coordinately promote Arp2/3 complex-mediated cortical actin assembly. Overactivation of this signaling cascade leads to excessive actin polymerization in the rear cortex, whereas its disruption causes defects in cortical integrity and function. Therefore, apart from its well-defined role in the formation of the protrusions at the cell front, the Arp2/3 complex-based actin carries out a previously unappreciated function in building the rear cortical subcompartment in rapidly migrating cells.",

GDI2 is more divergent (40-44% similarity) and lacks the N-terminal regulatory arm characteristic for RhoGDI proteins.

To investigate in vivo functions, we generated cell lines that lack or overexpress LimF and ChLim and strains that express activating or inhibiting variants of Rab21. Overexpression of LimF, loss of ChLim, or expression of constitutively active Rab21 increases the rate of phagocytosis above that of wild type. Conversely, loss of LimF, overexpression of ChLim, or expression of a dominant-negative Rab21 inhibits phagocytosis. Our studies using cells carrying multiple mutations in these genes further indicate that ChLim antagonizes the activating function of Rab21-GTP during phagocytosis; in turn, LimF is required for Rab21-GTP function. Finally, we demonstrate that ChLim and LimF localize to the phagocytic cup and phago-lysosomal vesicles. We suggest that LimF, ChLim, and activated Rab21-GTP participate as a novel signaling complex that regulates phagocytic activity.",

        "abstract": "We have identified a new Dictyostelium p21-activated protein kinase, PAKc, that we demonstrate to be required for proper chemotaxis. PAKc contains a Rac-GTPase binding (CRIB) and autoinhibitory domain, a PAK-related kinase domain, an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol binding domain, and a C-terminal extension related to the Gbetagamma binding domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste20, the latter two domains being required for PAKc transient localization to the plasma membrane. In response to chemoattractant stimulation, PAKc kinase activity is rapidly and transiently activated, with activity levels peaking at approximately 10 s. pakc null cells exhibit a loss of polarity and produce multiple lateral pseudopodia when placed in a chemoattractant gradient. PAKc preferentially binds the Dictyostelium Rac protein RacB, and point mutations in the conserved CRIB that abrogate this binding result in misregulated kinase activation and chemotaxis defects. We also demonstrate that a null mutation lacking the PAK family member myosin I heavy chain kinase (MIHCK) shows mild chemotaxis defects, including the formation of lateral pseudopodia. A null strain lacking both PAKc and the PAK family member MIHCK exhibits severe loss of cell movement, suggesting that PAKc and MIHCK may cooperate to regulate a common chemotaxis pathway.",

We previously showed that a Rho GTPase, RacE, regulates gradient sensing in Dictyostelium cells.

Using biochemical and gene knockout approaches, we show that GflB balances the activation of Ras and Rho GTPases, which enables cells to precisely orient signaling events toward higher concentrations of chemoattractants. Furthermore, we find that GflB is located at the leading edge of migrating cells, and this localization is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and phosphatidylserine. Our findings provide a new molecular mechanism that connects directional sensing and morphological polarization.",

        "abstract": "On starvation, Dictyostelium cells aggregate to form multicellular fruiting bodies containing spores that germinate when transferred to nutrient-rich medium. This developmental cycle correlates with the extent of actin phosphorylation at Tyr-53 (pY53-actin), which is low in vegetative cells but high in viable mature spores. Here we describe high-resolution crystal structures of pY53-actin and unphosphorylated actin in complexes with gelsolin segment 1 and profilin. In the structure of pY53-actin, the phosphate group on Tyr-53 makes hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues of the DNase I-binding loop (D-loop) of actin, resulting in a more stable conformation of the D-loop than in the unphosphorylated structures. A more rigidly folded D-loop may explain some of the previously described properties of pY53-actin, including its increased critical concentration for polymerization, reduced rates of nucleation and pointed end elongation, and weak affinity for DNase I. We show here that phosphorylation of Tyr-53 inhibits subtilisin cleavage of the D-loop and reduces the rate of nucleotide exchange on actin. The structure of profilin-Dictyostelium-actin is strikingly similar to previously determined structures of profilin-beta-actin and profilin-alpha-actin. By comparing this representative set of profilin-actin structures with other structures of actin, we highlight the effects of profilin on the actin conformation. In the profilin-actin complexes, subdomains 1 and 3 of actin close around profilin, producing a 4.7 degrees rotation of the two major domains of actin relative to each other. As a result, the nucleotide cleft becomes moderately more open in the profilin-actin complex, probably explaining the stimulation of nucleotide exchange on actin by profilin.",

        "abstract": "Inositol phospholipids are critical regulators of membrane biology throughout eukaryotes. The general principle by which they perform these roles is conserved across species and involves binding of differentially phosphorylated inositol head groups to specific protein domains. This interaction serves to both recruit and regulate the activity of several different classes of protein which act on membrane surfaces. In mammalian cells, these phosphorylated inositol head groups are predominantly borne by a C38:4 diacylglycerol backbone. We show here that the inositol phospholipids of Dictyostelium are different, being highly enriched in an unusual C34:1e lipid backbone, 1-hexadecyl-2-(11Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-myo-inositol), in which the sn-1 position contains an ether-linked C16:0 chain; they are thus plasmanylinositols. These plasmanylinositols respond acutely to stimulation of cells with chemoattractants, and their levels are regulated by PIPKs, PI3Ks and PTEN. In mammals and now in Dictyostelium, the hydrocarbon chains of inositol phospholipids are a highly selected subset of those available to other phospholipids, suggesting that different molecular selectors are at play in these organisms but serve a common, evolutionarily conserved purpose.",

        "abstract": "Differential cell motility, which plays a key role in many developmental processes, is perhaps most evident in examples of pattern formation in which the different cell types arise intermingled before sorting out into discrete tissues. This is thought to require heterogeneities in responsiveness to differentiation-inducing signals that result in the activation of cell type-specific genes and 'salt and pepper' patterning. How differential gene expression results in cell sorting is poorly defined. Here we describe a novel gene (hfnA) that provides the first mechanistic link between cell signalling, differential gene expression and cell type-specific sorting in Dictyostelium. HfnA defines a novel group of evolutionarily conserved HECT ubiquitin ligases with an N-terminal filamin domain (HFNs). HfnA expression is induced by the stalk differentiation-inducing factor DIF-1 and is restricted to a subset of prestalk cells (pstO). hfnA(-) pstO cells differentiate but their sorting out is delayed. Genetic interactions suggest that this is due to misregulation of filamin complex activity. Overexpression of filamin complex members phenocopies the hfnA(-) pstO cell sorting defect, whereas disruption of filamin complex function in a wild-type background results in pstO cells sorting more strongly. Filamin disruption in an hfnA(-) background rescues pstO cell localisation. hfnA(-) cells exhibit altered slug phototaxis phenotypes consistent with filamin complex hyperactivity. We propose that HfnA regulates filamin complex activity and cell type-specific motility through the breakdown of filamin complexes. These findings provide a novel mechanism for filamin regulation and demonstrate that filamin is a crucial mechanistic link between responses to differentiation signals and cell movement in patterning based on 'salt and pepper' differentiation and sorting out.",

Early multicellular organisms are mostly extinct and the origins of these mechanisms are unknown. Here using comparative genome and transcriptome analysis across eight uni- and multicellular amoebozoan genomes, we find that 80% of proteins essential for the development of multicellular Dictyostelia are already present in their unicellular relatives. This set is enriched in cytosolic and nuclear proteins, and protein kinases. The remaining 20%, unique to Dictyostelia, mostly consists of extracellularly exposed and secreted proteins, with roles in sensing and recognition, while several genes for synthesis of signals that induce cell-type specialization were acquired by lateral gene transfer. Across Dictyostelia, changes in gene expression correspond more strongly with phenotypic innovation than changes in protein functional domains. We conclude that the transition to multicellularity required novel signals and sensors rather than novel signal processing mechanisms.",

Over the last 25 years, screening novel drugs to control this aberrant proteolytic activity has yet to identify effective treatments for the disease. In the search for other mechanisms of presenilin pathology, several studies have demonstrated that mammalian presenilin proteins also act in a non-proteolytic role as a scaffold to co-localize key signaling proteins. This role is likely to represent an ancestral presenilin function, as it has been described in genetically distant species including non-mammalian animals, plants, and a simple eukaryotic amoeba Dictyostelium that diverged from the human lineage over a billion years ago. Here, we review the non-catalytic scaffold role of presenilin, from mammalian models to other biomedical models, and include recent insights using Dictyostelium, to suggest that this role may provide an early evolutionary function of presenilin proteins.",

Using single cell transcriptomics, we identified a subpopulation of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells experiencing spontaneous DNA damage. Damaged cells displayed high expression of <i>rad51</i>, with the gene induced by multiple types of genotoxic stress. Using live imaging, we tracked high Rad51 cells from differentiation onset until cell fate assignment. High Rad51 cells were shed from multicellular structures, excluding damaged cells from the spore population. Cell shedding resulted from impaired cell motility and defective cell-cell adhesion, with damaged cells additionally defective in activation of spore gene expression. These data indicate DNA damage is not insulated from other aspects of cell physiology during development and multiple features of damaged cells prevent propagation of genetic error. Our approach is generally applicable for monitoring rare subpopulations during development, and permits analysis of developmental perturbations occurring within a physiological dynamic range.",

We show that spreading in the highly motile cells of Dictyostelium is non-monotonic, and thus differs from the passage of spreading cells through a regular series of stages. Quantification of the gain and loss of contact area revealed fluctuating forces of protrusion and retraction that dominate the interaction of Dictyostelium cells with a substrate. The molecular basis of these fluctuations is elucidated by dual-fluorescence labeling of filamentous actin together with proteins that highlight specific activities in the actin system. Front-to-tail polarity is established by the sorting out of myosin-II from regions where dense actin assemblies are accumulating. Myosin-IB identifies protruding front regions, and the Arp2/3 complex localizes to lamellipodia protruded from the fronts. Coronin is used as a sensitive indicator of actin disassembly to visualize the delicate balance of polymerization and depolymerization in spreading cells. Short-lived actin patches that co-localize with clathrin suggest that membrane internalization occurs even when the substrate-attached cell surface expands. We conclude that non-monotonic cell spreading is characterized by spatiotemporal patterns formed by motor proteins together with regulatory proteins that either promote or terminate actin polymerization on the scale of seconds.",

The Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA binding (CHD) Type III proteins are a subfamily of SWI2/SNF2 proteins that control nucleosome positioning and are associated with several complex human disorders, including CHARGE syndrome and autism. Type III CHDs are required for multicellular development of animals and <i>Dictyostelium</i> but are absent in plants and yeast. These CHDs can mediate nucleosome translocation in vitro, but their in vivo mechanism is unknown. Here, we use genome-wide analysis of nucleosome positioning and transcription profiling to investigate the in vivo relationship between nucleosome positioning and gene expression during development of wild-type (WT) <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mutant cells lacking ChdC, a Type III CHD protein ortholog. We demonstrate major nucleosome positional changes associated with developmental gene regulation in WT. Loss of <i>chdC</i> caused an increase of intragenic nucleosome spacing and misregulation of gene expression, affecting \u223c50% of the genes that are repositioned during WT development. These analyses demonstrate active nucleosome repositioning during <i>Dictyostelium</i> multicellular development, establish an in vivo function of CHD Type III chromatin remodeling proteins in this process, and reveal the detailed relationship between nucleosome positioning and gene regulation, as cells transition between developmental states.",

We have identified a new Dictyostelium kinase (stress-activated protein kinase [SAPK]alpha), which is related to members of the mixed lineage kinase class of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. SAPKalpha is activated by osmotic stress, heat shock, and detachment from the substratum and by a membrane-permeable cGMP analog, a known regulator of stress responses in Dictyostelium. SAPKalpha is important for cellular resistance to stresses, because SAPKalpha null cells exhibit reduced viability in response to osmotic stress. We found that SAPKalpha mutants affect cellular processes requiring proper regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, including cell motility, morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and cell adhesion. Overexpression of SAPKalpha results in highly elevated basal and chemoattractant-stimulated F-actin levels and strong aggregation and developmental defects, including a failure to polarize and chemotax, and abnormal morphogenesis. These phenotypes require a kinase-active SAPKalpha. SAPKalpha null cells exhibit reduced chemoattractant-stimulated F-actin levels, cytokinesis, developmental and adhesion defects, and a motility defect that is less severe than that exhibited by SAPKalpha-overexpressing cells. SAPKalpha colocalizes with F-actin in F-actin-enriched structures, including membrane ruffles and pseudopodia during chemotaxis. Although SAPKalpha is required for these F-actin-mediated processes, it is not detectably activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation.",

Myosin II localization to the cleavage furrow is severely depressed in Kif12-null (Deltakif12) cells, which accounts in part for the cytokinesis failure. Myosin II-null cells, however, undergo mitosis-coupled cytokinesis when adhering to a surface, whereas the Deltakif12 cells cannot. During mitosis, the rate of change of internuclear separation in Deltakif12 cells is reduced compared with wild-type cells, indicating multiple roles of this molecular motor during mitosis and cytokinesis. GFP-Kif12, which rescues wild-type behavior when expressed in the Deltakif12 strain, is concentrated in the nucleus in interphase cells, translocates to the cytoplasm at the onset of mitosis, appears in the centrosomes and spindle, and later is concentrated in the spindle midbody. Given these results, we hypothesize a mechanism for myosin II translocation to the furrow to set up the contractile ring.",

We identified a new CV regulator, Disgorgin, a TBC-domain-containing protein, which translocates to the CV membrane at the late stage of CV charging and regulates CV-plasma membrane fusion and discharging. disgorgin(-) cells produce large CVs due to impaired CV-plasma membrane fusion. Disgorgin is a specific GAP for Rab8A-GTP, which also localizes to the CV and whose hydrolysis is required for discharging. We demonstrate that Drainin, a previously identified TBC-domain-containing protein, lies upstream from Disgorgin in this pathway. Unlike Disgorgin, Drainin lacks GAP activity but functions as a Rab11A effector. The BEACH family proteins LvsA and LvsD were identified in a suppressor/enhancer screen of the disgorgin(-) large CV phenotype and demonstrated to have distinct functions in regulating CV formation. Our studies help define the pathways controlling CV function.",

        "abstract": "Myosin light chains are key regulators of class 1 myosins and typically comprise two domains, with calmodulin being the archetypal example. They bind IQ motifs within the myosin neck region and amplify conformational changes in the motor domain. A single lobe light chain, myosin light chain C (MlcC), was recently identified and shown to specifically bind to two sequentially divergent IQ motifs of the Dictyostelium myosin-1C. To provide a molecular basis of this interaction, the structures of apo-MlcC and a 2:1 MlcC\u00b7myosin-1C neck complex were determined. The two non-functional EF-hand motifs of MlcC pack together to form a globular four-helix bundle that opens up to expose a central hydrophobic groove, which interacts with the N-terminal portion of the divergent IQ1 and IQ2 motifs. The N- and C-terminal regions of MlcC make critical contacts that contribute to its specific interactions with the myosin-1C divergent IQ motifs, which are contacts that deviate from the traditional mode of calmodulin-IQ recognition.",

        "abstract": "In contrast to the enormous advances made regarding mechanisms of conventional protein secretion, mechanistic insights into the unconventional secretion of proteins are lacking. Acyl coenzyme A (CoA)-binding protein (ACBP; AcbA in Dictyostelium discoideum), an unconventionally secreted protein, is dependent on Golgi reassembly and stacking protein (GRASP) for its secretion. We discovered, surprisingly, that the secretion, processing, and function of an AcbA-derived peptide, SDF-2, are conserved between the yeast Pichia pastoris and D. discoideum. We show that in yeast, the secretion of SDF-2-like activity is GRASP dependent, triggered by nitrogen starvation, and requires autophagy proteins as well as medium-chain fatty acyl CoA generated by peroxisomes. Additionally, a phospholipase D implicated in soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor-mediated vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane is necessary, but neither peroxisome turnover nor fusion between autophagosomes and the vacuole is essential. Moreover, yeast Acb1 and several proteins required for its secretion are necessary for sporulation in P. pastoris. Our findings implicate currently unknown, evolutionarily conserved pathways in unconventional secretion.",

TORC1 is required for growth in response to growth factors, nutrients and the cellular energy state; TORC2 regulates AKT signaling, which can modulate cytoskeletal polarization. In its ecological niche, Dictyostelium engulf bacteria and yeast for nutrient capture. Despite the essential role of TORC1 in control of cellular growth, we show that nutrient particle capture (phagocytosis) in Dictyostelium is independent of TORC1-mediated nutrient sensing and growth regulation. However, loss of Dictyostelium TORC2 components Rictor/Pia, SIN1/RIP3 and Lst8 promotes nutrient particle uptake; inactivation of TORC2 leads to increased efficiency and speed of phagocytosis. In contrast to phagocytosis, we show that macropinocytosis, an AKT-dependent process for cellular uptake of fluid phase nutrients, is not regulated by either of the TOR complexes. The integrated and balanced regulation of TORC1 and TORC2 might be crucial in Dictyostelium to coordinate growth and energy needs with other essential TOR-regulated processes.",

While rasC expression is enriched in a cell type-specific manner during post-aggregative development, the defect in rasC(-) cells is restricted to aggregation and fully corrected by application of exogenous cAMP pulses. cAMP is not produced in rasC(-) cells stimulated by 2'-deoxy-cAMP, but is produced in response to GTPgammaS in cell lysates, indicating that G-protein-coupled cAMP receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase is regulated by RasC. However, cAMP-induced ERK2 phosphorylation is unaffected in rasC(-) cells, indicating that RasC is not an upstream activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase required for cAMP relay. rasC(-) cells also exhibit reduced chemotaxis to cAMP during early development and delayed response to periodic cAMP stimuli produced by wild-type cells in chimeric mixtures. Furthermore, cAMP-induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation through a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway is dramatically reduced in rasC(-) cells, suggesting that G-protein-coupled serpentine receptor activation of PI3K is regulated by RasC. Cells lacking the RasGEF, AleA, exhibit similar defects as rasC(-) cells, suggesting that AleA may activate RasC.",

To examine whether total cell surface area changes are required for cell migration, Dictyostelium cells were flattened by agar-overlay. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that flattened migrating cells have no membrane reservoirs such as projections and membrane folds. Similarly, optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy showed that the cell surface area does not change during migration. Interestingly, staining of the cell membrane with a fluorescent lipid analogue demonstrated that the turnover rate of cell membrane is closely related to the cell migration velocity. Next, to clarify the mechanism of cell membrane circulation, local photobleaching was separately performed on the dorsal and ventral cell membranes of rapidly moving cells. The bleached zones on both sides moved rearward relative to the cell. Thus, the cell membrane moves in a fountain-like fashion, accompanied by a high membrane turnover rate and actively contributing to cell migration.",

        "abstract": "Class I myosins have a single heavy chain comprising an N-terminal motor domain with actin-activated ATPase activity and a C-terminal globular tail with a basic region that binds to acidic phospholipids. These myosins contribute to the formation of actin-rich protrusions such as pseudopodia, but regulation of the dynamic localization to these structures is not understood. Previously, we found that Acanthamoeba myosin IC binds to acidic phospholipids in vitro through a short sequence of basic and hydrophobic amino acids, BH site, based on the charge density of the phospholipids. The tail of Dictyostelium myosin IB (DMIB) also contains a BH site. We now report that the BH site is essential for DMIB binding to the plasma membrane and describe the molecular basis of the dynamic relocalization of DMIB in live cells. Endogenous DMIB is localized uniformly on the plasma membrane of resting cells, at active protrusions and cell-cell contacts of randomly moving cells, and at the front of motile polarized cells. The BH site is required for association of DMIB with the plasma membrane at all stages where it colocalizes with phosphoinositide bisphosphate/phosphoinositide trisphosphate (PIP(2)/PIP(3)). The charge-based specificity of the BH site allows for in vivo specificity of DMIB for PIP(2)/PIP(3) similar to the PH domain-based specificity of other class I myosins. However, DMIB-head is required for relocalization of DMIB to the front of migrating cells. Motor activity is not essential, but the actin binding site in the head is important. Thus, dynamic relocalization of DMIB is determined principally by the local PIP(2)/PIP(3) concentration in the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic F-actin.",

Studies show that an excitable signal transduction network acts as a pacemaker that controls the cytoskeleton to drive motility. Here we show that this network is required to link stimuli to actin polymerization and chemotactic motility and we distinguish the various models of chemotaxis. First, signalling activity is suppressed towards the low side in a gradient or following removal of uniform chemoattractant. Second, signalling activities display a rapid shut off and a slower adaptation during which responsiveness to subsequent test stimuli decline. Simulations of various models indicate that these properties require coupled adaptive and excitable networks. Adaptation involves a G-protein-independent inhibitor, as stimulation of cells lacking G-protein function suppresses basal activities. The salient features of the coupled networks were observed for different chemoattractants in Dictyostelium and in human neutrophils, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for eukaryotic chemotaxis.",

Here, we expand the FBP candidate list in the social amoeba Dictyostelium and show that the Skp1 interactome is highly remodeled as cells transition from growth to multicellular development. Importantly, a subset of candidate FBPs was less represented when the posttranslational hydroxylation and glycosylation of Skp1 was abrogated by deletion of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing Skp1 prolyl hydroxylase PhyA. A role for this Skp1 modification for SCF activity was indicated by partial rescue of development, which normally depends on high O<sub>2</sub> and PhyA, of phyA-KO cells by proteasomal inhibitors. Further examination of two FBPs, FbxwD and the Jumonji C protein JcdI, suggested that Skp1 was substituted by other factors in phyA-KO cells. Although a double-KO of jcdI and its paralog jcdH did not affect development, overexpression of JcdI increased its sensitivity to O<sub>2</sub>. JcdI, a nonheme dioxygenase shown to have physiological O<sub>2</sub> dependence, is conserved across protists with its F-box and other domains, and is related to the human oncogene JmjD6. Sensitization of JcdI-overexpression cells to O<sub>2</sub> depended on its dioxygenase activity and other domains, but not its F-box, which may however be the mediator of its reduced levels in WT relative to Skp1 modification mutant cells. The findings suggest that activation of JcdI by O<sub>2</sub> is tempered by homeostatic downregulation via PhyA and association with Skp1.",

We used forward genetics to identify the causative gene underlying this phenotype. This gene encodes the RasGAP Neurofibromin (NF1). Loss of NF1 enables axenic growth by increasing fluid uptake. Mutants form outsized macropinosomes which are promoted by greater Ras and PI3K activity at sites of endocytosis. Relatedly, NF1 mutants can ingest larger-than-normal particles using phagocytosis. An NF1 reporter is recruited to nascent macropinosomes, suggesting that NF1 limits their size by locally inhibiting Ras signalling. Our results link NF1 with macropinocytosis and phagocytosis for the first time, and we propose that NF1 evolved in early phagotrophs to spatially modulate Ras activity, thereby constraining and shaping their feeding structures.",

        "abstract": "When growth stops due to the depletion of nutrients, Dictyostelium cells rapidly turn off vegetative genes and start to express developmental genes. One of the early developmental genes, dia1, is adjacent to a vegetative gene, impA, on chromosome 4. An intergenic region of 654 bp separates the coding regions of these divergently transcribed genes. Constructs carrying the intergenic region expressed a reporter gene (green fluorescent protein gene) that replaced impA in growing cells and a reporter gene that replaced dia1 (DsRed) during development. Deletion of a 112-bp region proximal to the transcriptional start site of impA resulted in complete lack of expression of both reporter genes during growth or development. At the other end of the intergenic region there are two copies of a motif that is also found in the carA regulatory region. Removing one copy of this repeat reduced impA expression twofold. Removing the second copy had no further consequences. Removing the central portion of the intergenic region resulted in high levels of expression of dia1 in growing cells, indicating that this region contains a sequence involved in repression during the vegetative stage. Gel shift experiments showed that a nuclear protein present in growing cells recognizes the sequence GAAGTTCTAATTGATTGAAG found in this region. This DNA binding activity is lost within the first 4 h of development. Different nuclear proteins were found to recognize the repeated sequence proximal to dia1. One of these became prevalent after 4 h of development. Together these regulatory components at least partially account for this aspect of the growth-to-differentiation transition.",

        "title": "Two complementary, local excitation, global inhibition mechanisms acting in parallel can explain the chemoattractant-induced regulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 response in dictyostelium cells.",
        "abstract": "Chemotaxing cells, such as Dictyostelium and mammalian neutrophils, sense shallow chemoattractant gradients and respond with highly polarized changes in cell morphology and motility. Uniform chemoattractant stimulation induces the transient translocations of several downstream signaling components, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), tensin homology protein (PTEN), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). In contrast, static spatial chemoattractant gradients elicit the persistent, amplified localization of these molecules. We have proposed a model in which the response to chemoattractant is regulated by a balance of a local excitation and a global inhibition, both of which are controlled by receptor occupancy. This model can account for both the transient and spatial responses to chemoattractants, but alone does not amplify the external gradient. In this article, we develop a model in which parallel local excitation, global inhibition mechanisms control the membrane binding of PI3K and PTEN. Together, the action of these enzymes induces an amplified PI(3,4,5)P3 response that agrees quantitatively with experimentally obtained plekstrin homology-green fluorescent protein distributions in latrunculin-treated cells. We compare the model's performance with that of several mutants in which one or both of the enzymes are disrupted. The model accounts for the observed response to multiple, simultaneous chemoattractant cues and can recreate the cellular response to combinations of temporal and spatial stimuli. Finally, we use the model to predict the response of a cell where only a fraction is stimulated by a saturating dose of chemoattractant.",

The recovery stroke is considered one of the key steps of the kinetic cycle as it is the conformational rearrangement required to position the active site residues for hydrolysis of ATP and interaction with actin. We explored the free-energy surface of the transition and investigated the effect of the genetic cardiomyopathy causing mutations R453C, I457T, and I467T on this step using metadynamics. This work extends previous studies on <i>Dictyostelium</i> myosin II with engineered mutations. Here, like previously, we generated an unbiased thermodynamic ensemble of reactive trajectories for the chemical step using transition path sampling. Our methodologies were able to predict the changes to the dynamics of the recovery stroke as well as predict the pathway of breakdown of ATP to ADP and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> with the stabilization of the metaphosphate intermediate.

        "abstract": "In Dictyostelium, the cytoskeletal proteins Actin binding protein 1 (Abp1) and the class I myosin MyoK directly interact and couple actin dynamics to membrane deformation during phagocytosis. Together with the kinase PakB, they build a regulatory switch that controls the efficiency of uptake of large particles. As a basis for further functional dissection, exhaustive phagosome proteomics was performed and established that about 1300 proteins participate in phagosome biogenesis. Then, quantitative and comparative proteomic analysis of phagosome maturation was performed to investigate the impact of the absence of MyoK or Abp1. Immunoblots and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis of phagosomes isolated from myoK-null and abp1-null cells were used to determine the relative abundance of proteins during the course of maturation. Immunoblot profiling showed that absence of Abp1 alters the maturation profile of its direct binding partners such as actin and the Arp2/3 complex, suggesting that Abp1 directly regulates actin dynamics at the phagosome. Comparative two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis analysis resulted in the quantification of mutant-to-wild type abundance ratios at all stages of maturation for over one hundred identified proteins. Coordinated temporal changes in these ratio profiles determined the classification of identified proteins into functional groups. Ratio profiling revealed that the early delivery of ER proteins to the phagosome was affected by the absence of MyoK and was coupled to a reciprocal imbalance in the delivery of the vacuolar proton pump and Rab11 GTPases. As direct functional consequences, a delayed acidification and a reduced intraphagosomal proteolysis were demonstrated in vivo in myoK-null cells. In conclusion, the absence of MyoK alters the balance of the contributions of the ER and an endo-lysosomal compartment, and slows down phagosome acidification as well as the speed and efficiency of particle degradation inside the phagosome.",

During late telophase the centrosome relocates to the cytoplasmic side of the nucleus, the central spindle disassembles and the nuclear fenestrae become closed. Our data indicate that Dictyostelium spastin (DdSpastin) is a microtubule-binding and severing type I membrane protein that plays a role in this process. Its mitotic localization is in agreement with a requirement for the removal of microtubules that would hinder closure of the fenestrae. Furthermore, DdSpastin interacts with the HeH/ LEM-family protein Src1 in BioID analyses as well as the inner nuclear membrane protein Sun1, and shows subcellular co-localizations with Src1, Sun1, the ESCRT component CHMP7 and the IST1-like protein filactin, suggesting that the principal pathway of mitotic nuclear envelope remodeling is conserved between animals and Dictyostelium amoebae.",

The majority of cancer-associated PTEN mutations block its essential PIP3 phosphatase activity. However, there is a group of clinically identified PTEN mutations that maintain enzymatic activity, and it is unknown how these mutations contribute to tumor pathogenesis. Here, we show that these enzymatically competent PTEN mutants fail to translocate to the plasma membrane where PTEN converts PIP3 to PI(4,5)P2. Artificial membrane tethering of the PTEN mutants effectively restores tumor suppressor activity and represses excess PIP3 signaling in cells. Thus, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of tumorigenic PTEN deficiency.",

In this study, we analyzed a phenomenological model assuming the presence of cellular inertia, as well as a response time in motility, resulting in the reproduction of the cellular memory observed in the previous experiments. According to the analysis, the cellular motion is described by the superposition of multiple oscillative functions induced by the multiplication of the oscillative polarity and motility. The cellular intertia generates cellular memory by regulating phase differences between those oscillative functions. By applying the theory to the experimental data, the cellular inertia was estimated at [Formula: see text] min. In addition, physiological parameters, such as response time in motility and intracellular processing speed, were also evaluated. The agreement between the experiemental data and theory suggests the possibility of the presence of the response time in motility, which has never been biologically verified and should be explored in the future.",

        "abstract": "Capping protein Arp2/3 myosin I linker (CARMIL) proteins are multi-domain scaffold proteins that regulate actin dynamics by regulating the activity of capping protein (CP). Here, we characterize CARMIL-GAP (GAP for GTPase-activating protein), a Dictyostelium CARMIL isoform that contains a \u223c130 residue insert that, by homology, confers GTPase-activating properties for Rho-related GTPases. Consistent with this idea, this GAP domain binds Dictyostelium Rac1a and accelerates its rate of GTP hydrolysis. CARMIL-GAP concentrates with F-actin in phagocytic cups and at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells, and CARMIL-GAP-null cells exhibit pronounced defects in phagocytosis and chemotactic streaming. Importantly, these defects are fully rescued by expressing GFP-tagged CARMIL-GAP in CARMIL-GAP-null cells. Finally, rescue with versions of CARMIL-GAP that lack either GAP activity or the ability to regulate CP show that, although both activities contribute significantly to CARMIL-GAP function, the GAP activity plays the bigger role. Together, our results add to the growing evidence that CARMIL proteins influence actin dynamics by regulating signaling molecules as well as CP, and that the continuous cycling of the nucleotide state of Rho GTPases is often required to drive Rho-dependent biological processes.",

        "abstract": "The rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to external stimuli is an essential property of many motile eukaryotic cells. Here, we report evidence that the actin machinery of chemotactic Dictyostelium cells operates close to an oscillatory instability. When averaging the actin response of many cells to a short pulse of the chemoattractant cAMP, we observed a transient accumulation of cortical actin reminiscent of a damped oscillation. At the single-cell level, however, the response dynamics ranged from short, strongly damped responses to slowly decaying, weakly damped oscillations. Furthermore, in a small subpopulation, we observed self-sustained oscillations in the cortical F-actin concentration. To substantiate that an oscillatory mechanism governs the actin dynamics in these cells, we systematically exposed a large number of cells to periodic pulse trains of different frequencies. Our results indicate a resonance peak at a stimulation period of around 20 s. We propose a delayed feedback model that explains our experimental findings based on a time-delay in the regulatory network of the actin system. To test the model, we performed stimulation experiments with cells that express GFP-tagged fusion proteins of Coronin and actin-interacting protein 1, as well as knockout mutants that lack Coronin and actin-interacting protein 1. These actin-binding proteins enhance the disassembly of actin filaments and thus allow us to estimate the delay time in the regulatory feedback loop. Based on this independent estimate, our model predicts an intrinsic period of 20 s, which agrees with the resonance observed in our periodic stimulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "The surface behaviour of swimming amoebae was followed in cells bearing a cAR1-paGFP (cyclic AMP receptor fused to a photoactivatable-GFP) construct. Sensitized amoebae were placed in a buoyant medium where they could swim toward a chemoattractant cAMP source. paGFP, activated at the cell's front, remained fairly stationary in the cell's frame as the cell advanced; the label was not swept rearwards. Similar experiments with chemotaxing cells attached to a substratum gave the same result. Furthermore, if the region around a lateral projection near a crawling cell's front is marked, the projection and the labelled cAR1 behave differently. The label spreads by diffusion but otherwise remains stationary in the cell's frame; the lateral projection moves rearwards on the cell (remaining stationary with respect to the substrate), so that it ends up outside the labelled region. Furthermore, as cAR1-GFP cells move, they occasionally do so in a remarkably straight line; this suggests they do not need to snake to move on a substratum. Previously, we suggested that the surface membrane of a moving amoeba flows from front to rear as part of a polarised membrane trafficking cycle. This could explain how swimming amoebae are able to exert a force against the medium. Our present results indicate that, in amoebae, the suggested surface flow does not exist: this implies that they swim by shape changes.",

The gamma-adaptin AP-1 subunit was cloned and shown to belong to a Golgi-localized 300-kDa protein complex. Time-lapse analysis of cells expressing gamma-adaptin tagged with the green-fluorescent protein demonstrates the dynamics of AP-1-coated structures leaving the Golgi apparatus and rarely moving toward the TGN. Targeted disruption of the AP-1 medium chain results in viable cells displaying a severe growth defect and a delayed developmental cycle compared with parental cells. Lysosomal enzymes are constitutively secreted as precursors, suggesting that protein transport between the TGN and lysosomes is defective.

        "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that underlie asymmetric PTEN distribution at the posterior of polarized motile cells and regulate anterior pseudopod formation were addressed by novel single-molecule tracking analysis. Heterogeneity in the lateral mobility of PTEN on a membrane indicated the existence of three membrane-binding states with different diffusion coefficients and membrane-binding lifetimes. The stochastic state transition kinetics of PTEN among these three states were suggested to be regulated spatially along the cell polarity such that only the stable binding state is selectively suppressed at the anterior membrane to cause local PTEN depletion. By incorporating experimentally observed kinetic parameters into a simple mathematical model, the asymmetric PTEN distribution can be explained quantitatively to illustrate the regulatory mechanisms for cellular asymmetry based on an essential causal link between individual stochastic reactions and stable localizations of the ensemble.",

        "abstract": "Cell division requires the tight coordination of multiple cytoskeletal pathways. The best understood of these involves myosin-II-dependent constriction around the cell equator, but both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells also use a parallel, adhesion-dependent mechanism to generate furrows. We show that the actin nucleation factor SCAR/WAVE is strongly activated during Dictyostelium cytokinesis. This activation localises to large polar protrusions, driving separation of the daughter cells. This continues for 10 minutes after division before the daughter cells revert to normal random motility, indicating that this is a tightly regulated process. We demonstrate that SCAR activity is essential to drive myosin-II-independent cytokinesis, and stabilises the furrow, ensuring symmetrical division. SCAR is also responsible for the generation of MiDASes, mitosis-specific actin-rich adhesions. Loss of SCAR in both Dictyostelium and Drosophila leads to a similar mitotic phenotype, with severe mitotic blebbing, indicating conserved functionality. We also find that the microtubule end-binding protein EB1 is required to restrict SCAR localisation and direct migration. EB1-null cells also exhibit decreased adhesion during mitosis. Our data reveal a spindle-directed signalling pathway that regulates SCAR activity, migration and adhesion at mitosis.",

        "abstract": "Blebs and F-actin-driven pseudopods are alternative ways of extending the leading edge of migrating cells. We show that Dictyostelium cells switch from using predominantly pseudopods to blebs when migrating under agarose overlays of increasing stiffness. Blebs expand faster than pseudopods leaving behind F-actin scars, but are less persistent. Blebbing cells are strongly chemotactic to cyclic-AMP, producing nearly all of their blebs up-gradient. When cells re-orientate to a needle releasing cyclic-AMP, they stereotypically produce first microspikes, then blebs and pseudopods only later. Genetically, blebbing requires myosin-II and increases when actin polymerization or cortical function is impaired. Cyclic-AMP induces transient blebbing independently of much of the known chemotactic signal transduction machinery, but involving PI3-kinase and downstream PH domain proteins, CRAC and PhdA. Impairment of this PI3-kinase pathway results in slow movement under agarose and cells that produce few blebs, though actin polymerization appears unaffected. We propose that mechanical resistance induces bleb-driven movement in Dictyostelium, which is chemotactic and controlled through PI3-kinase.",

Dictyostelid social amoebas offer a good system to study the evolution of multicellular complexity, with a well-resolved phylogeny and molecular genetic tools being available. We compare the life cycles of the Dictyostelids with closely related amoebozoans to show that complex life cycles were already present in the unicellular common ancestor of Dictyostelids. We propose frost resistance as an early driver of multicellular evolution in Dictyostelids and show that the cell signalling pathways for differentiating spore and stalk cells evolved from that for encystation. The stalk cell differentiation program was further modified, possibly through gene duplication, to evolve a new cell type, cup cells, in Group 4 Dictyostelids. Studies in various multicellular organisms, including Dictyostelids, volvocine algae, and metazoans, suggest as a common principle in the evolution of multicellular complexity that unicellular regulatory programs for adapting to environmental change serve as \"proto-cell types\" for subsequent evolution of multicellular organisms. Later, new cell types could further evolve by duplicating and diversifying the \"proto-cell type\" gene regulatory networks.",

        "abstract": "Myosin II molecules in the thick filaments of striated muscle form a structure in which the heads interact with each other and fold back onto the tail. This structure, the \"interacting heads motif\" (IHM), provides a mechanistic basis for the auto-inhibition of myosin in relaxed thick filaments. Similar IHM interactions occur in single myosin molecules of smooth and nonmuscle cells in the switched-off state. In addition to the interaction between the two heads, which inhibits their activity, the IHM also contains an interaction between the motor domain of one head and the initial part (subfragment 2, S2) of the tail. This is thought to be a crucial anchoring interaction that holds the IHM in place on the thick filament. S2 appears to cross the head at a specific location within a broader region of the motor domain known as the myosin mesa. Here, we show that the positive and negative charge distribution in this part of the mesa is complementary to the charge distribution on S2. We have designated this the \"mesa trail\" owing to its linear path across the mesa. We studied the structural sequence alignment, the location of charged residues on the surface of myosin head atomic models, and the distribution of surface charge potential along the mesa trail in different types of myosin II and in different species. The charge distribution in both the mesa trail and the adjacent S2 is relatively conserved. This suggests a common basis for IHM formation across different myosin IIs, dependent on attraction between complementary charged patches on S2 and the myosin head. Conservation from mammals to insects suggests that the mesa trail/S2 interaction plays a key role in the inhibitory function of the IHM.",

Mathematical models have suggested quite different regulatory mechanisms to explain reorientation, raising the question of how we can validate these models in a rigorous way. In this study, we fit three reaction-diffusion models to experimental data of Dictyostelium amoebae reorienting in response to alternating gradients of mechanical shear flow. The experimental readouts we use to fit are spatio-temporal distributions of a fluorescent reporter for cortical F-actin labeling the cell front. Experiments performed under different conditions are fitted simultaneously to challenge the models with different types of cellular dynamics. Although the model proposed by Otsuji is unable to provide a satisfactory fit, those suggested by Meinhardt and Levchenko fit equally well. Further, we show that reduction of the three-variable Meinhardt model to a two-variable model also provides an excellent fit, but has the advantage of all parameters being uniquely identifiable. Our work demonstrates that model selection and identifiability analysis, commonly applied to temporal dynamics problems in systems biology, can be a powerful tool when extended to spatio-temporal imaging data.",

No atomic-resolution structure had been identified on \u03b3-secretase or any of its four components, hindering mechanistic understanding of \u03b3-secretase function. Here we report the crystal structure of nicastrin from Dictyostelium purpureum at 1.95-\u00c5 resolution. The extracellular domain of nicastrin contains a large lobe and a small lobe. The large lobe of nicastrin, thought to be responsible for substrate recognition, associates with the small lobe through a hydrophobic pivot at the center. The putative substrate-binding pocket is shielded from the small lobe by a lid, which blocks substrate entry. These structural features suggest a working model of nicastrin function. Analysis of nicastrin structure provides insights into the assembly and architecture of the \u03b3-secretase complex.",

        "abstract": "Both <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae and mammalian cells are endowed with an elaborate actin cytoskeleton that enables them to perform a multitude of tasks essential for survival. Although these organisms diverged more than a billion years ago, their cells share the capability of chemotactic migration, large-scale endocytosis, binary division effected by actomyosin contraction, and various types of adhesions to other cells and to the extracellular environment. The composition and dynamics of the transient actin-based structures that are engaged in these processes are also astonishingly similar in these evolutionary distant organisms. The question arises whether this remarkable resemblance in the cellular motility hardware is accompanied by a similar correspondence in matching software, the signalling networks that govern the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Small GTPases from the Rho family play pivotal roles in the control of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Indicatively, <i>Dictyostelium</i> matches mammals in the number of these proteins. We give an overview of the Rho signalling pathways that regulate the actin dynamics in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and compare them with similar signalling networks in mammals. We also provide a phylogeny of Rho GTPases in Amoebozoa, which shows a variability of the Rho inventories across different clades found also in Metazoa.",

In this study, Erk2 was found to be essential for the cAMP-stimulated translocation of the GATA transcription factor GtaC as indicated by the distribution of a GFP-GtaC reporter. Erk2 was also found to be essential for the translocation of GtaC in response to external folate, a foraging signal that directs the chemotaxis of amoeba to bacteria. Erk1, the only other Dictyostelium MAPK, was not required for the GtaC translocation to either chemoattractant, indicating that GFP-GtaC is a kinase translocation reporter specific for atypical MAPKs. The translocation of GFP-GtaC in response to folate was absent in mutants lacking the folate receptor Far1 or the coupled G-protein subunit G\u03b14. Loss of GtaC function resulted in enhanced chemotactic movement to folate, suggesting that GtaC suppresses responses to folate. The alteration of four Erk2-preferred phosphorylation sites in GtaC impacted the translocation of GFP-GtaC in response to folate and the GFP-GtaC-mediated rescue of aggregation and development of gtaC- cells. The ability of different chemoattractants to stimulate Erk2-regulated GtaC translocation suggests that atypical MAPK-mediated regulation of transcription factors can contribute to different cell fates.",

        "abstract": "During the evolution of gene families, functional diversification of proteins often follows gene duplication. However, many gene families expand while preserving protein sequence. Why do cells maintain multiple copies of the same gene? Here we have addressed this question for an actin family with 17 genes encoding an identical protein. The genes have divergent flanking regions and are scattered throughout the genome. Surprisingly, almost the entire family showed similar developmental expression profiles, with their expression also strongly coupled in single cells. Using live cell imaging, we show that differences in gene expression were apparent over shorter timescales, with family members displaying different transcriptional bursting dynamics. Strong \"bursty\" behaviors contrasted steady, more continuous activity, indicating different regulatory inputs to individual actin genes. To determine the sources of these different dynamic behaviors, we reciprocally exchanged the upstream regulatory regions of gene family members. This revealed that dynamic transcriptional behavior is directly instructed by upstream sequence, rather than features specific to genomic context. A residual minor contribution of genomic context modulates the gene OFF rate. Our data suggest promoter diversification following gene duplication could expand the range of stimuli that regulate the expression of essential genes. These observations contextualize the significance of transcriptional bursting.",

We confirm this for MrfA but report a radically different mode of processing from that of paradigmatic tethered transcriptional regulators, which are cleaved within the transmembrane domain by a dedicated protease. Instead, an auto-proteolytic cleavage mechanism, previously only described for the intramolecular chaperone domains of bacteriophage tail-spike proteins, processes MrfA and, by implication, the metazoan MRF proteins.

However, the ability to synthesize nine amino acids (Phe, Trp, Ile, Leu, Val, Lys, His, Thr, and Met) was lost in a wide variety of eukaryotes that evolved the ability to feed on other organisms. Since the biosynthetic pathways and their respective enzymes are well characterized, orthologs can be recognized in whole genomes to understand when in evolution pathways were lost. The pattern of pathway loss and retention was analyzed in the complete genomes of three early-diverging protist parasites, the amoeba Dictyostelium, and six animals. The nine pathways were lost independently in animals, Dictyostelium, Leishmania, Plasmodium, and Cryptosporidium. Seven additional pathways appear to have been lost in one or another parasite, demonstrating that they are dispensable in a nutrition-rich environment. Our predictions of pathways retained and pathways lost based on computational analyses of whole genomes are validated by minimal-medium studies with mammals, fish, worms, and Dictyostelium. The apparent selective advantages of retaining biosynthetic capabilities for amino acids available in the diet are considered.",

Unlike metazoans, unicellular eukaryotes depend exclusively on the extracellular medium for this supply. When environmental nutrients become depleted, existing cytoplasmic components will be catabolized by (macro)autophagy in order to re-use building blocks and to support ATP production. In many cases, autophagy takes care of cellular housekeeping to sustain cellular viability. Autophagy encompasses a multitude of related and often highly specific processes that are implicated in both biogenetic and catabolic processes. Recent data indicate that in some unicellular eukaryotes that undergo profound differentiation during their life cycle (e.g. kinetoplastid parasites and amoebes), autophagy is essential for the developmental change that allows the cell to adapt to a new host or form spores. This review summarizes the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of autophagy as well as the cytoplasm-to-vacuole-targeting pathway, pexophagy, mitophagy, ER-phagy, ribophagy and piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus, all highly selective forms of autophagy that have first been uncovered in yeast species. Additionally, a detailed analysis will be presented on the state of knowledge on autophagy in non-yeast unicellular eukaryotes with emphasis on the role of this process in differentiation.",

Here we develop a method to manipulate PIP3 levels in living cells and used it to show PIP3 suppresses the membrane localization of PTEN. Single-molecule measurements of membrane-association and -dissociation kinetics and of lateral diffusion reveal that PIP3 suppresses the PTEN binding site required for stable PTEN membrane binding. Mutual inhibition between PIP3 and PTEN provides a mechanistic basis for bistability that creates a PIP3-enriched/PTEN-excluded state and a PTEN-enriched/PIP3-excluded state underlying the strict spatial separation between PIP3 and PTEN. The PTEN binding site also mediates the suppression of PTEN membrane localization in chemotactic signaling. These results illustrate that the PIP3-PTEN bistable system underlies a cell's decision-making for directional movement irrespective of the environment.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of multicellularity required novel mechanisms for intercellular communication, but their origin is unclear. Dictyostelium cells exchange signals to position specialized cell types in multicellular spore-bearing structures. These signals activate complex pathways that converge on activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Genes controlling PKA were detected in the Dictyostelid unicellular ancestors, which like most protists form dormant cysts when experiencing environmental stress. We deleted PKA and the adenylate cyclases AcrA and AcgA, which synthesize cAMP for PKA activation, in the intermediate species Polysphondylium, which can develop into either cysts or into multicellular structures. Loss of PKA prevented multicellular development, but also completely blocked encystation. Loss of AcrA and AcgA, both essential for sporulation in Dictyostelium, did not affect Polysphondylium sporulation, but prevented encystation. We conclude that multicellular cAMP signalling was co-opted from PKA regulation of protist encystation with progressive refunctionalization of pathway components.",

        "abstract": "The widespread LIS1-proteins were originally identified as the target for sporadic mutations causing lissencephaly in humans. Dictyostelium LIS1 (DdLIS1) is a microtubule-associated protein exhibiting 53% identity to human LIS1. It colocalizes with dynein at isolated, microtubule-free centrosomes, suggesting that both are integral centrosomal components. Replacement of the DdLIS1 gene by the hypomorphic D327H allele or overexpression of an MBP-DdLIS1 fusion disrupted various dynein-associated functions. Microtubules lost contact with the cell cortex and were dragged behind an unusually motile centrosome. Previously, this phenotype was observed in cells overexpressing fragments of dynein or the XMAP215-homologue DdCP224. DdLIS1 was coprecipitated with DdCP224, suggesting that both act together in dynein-mediated cortical attachment of microtubules. Furthermore, DdLIS1-D327H mutants showed Golgi dispersal and reduced centrosome/nucleus association. Defects in DdLIS1 function also altered actin dynamics characterized by traveling waves of actin polymerization correlated with a reduced F-actin content. DdLIS1 could be involved in actin dynamics through Rho-GTPases, because DdLIS1 interacted directly with Rac1A in vitro. Our results show that DdLIS1 is required for maintenance of the microtubule cytoskeleton, Golgi apparatus and nucleus/centrosome association, and they suggest that LIS1-dependent alterations of actin dynamics could also contribute to defects in neuronal migration in lissencephaly patients.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium p21-activated kinase B (PakB) phosphorylates and activates class I myosins. PakB colocalizes with myosin I to actin-rich regions of the cell, including macropinocytic and phagocytic cups and the leading edge of migrating cells. Here we show that residues 1-180 mediate the cellular localization of PakB. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down experiments identify two proline-rich motifs in PakB-1-180 that directly interact with the SH3 domain of Dictyostelium actin-binding protein 1 (dAbp1). dAbp1 colocalizes with PakB to actin-rich regions in the cell. The loss of dAbp1 does not affect the cellular distribution of PakB, whereas the loss of PakB causes dAbp1 to adopt a diffuse cytosolic distribution. Cosedimentation studies show that the N-terminal region of PakB (residues 1-70) binds directly to actin filaments, whereas dAbp1 exhibits only a low affinity for filamentous actin. PakB-1-180 significantly enhances the binding of dAbp1 to actin filaments. When overexpressed in PakB-null cells, dAbp1 completely blocks early development at the aggregation stage, prevents cell polarization, and significantly reduces chemotaxis rates. The inhibitory effects are abrogated by the introduction of a function-blocking mutation into the dAbp1 SH3 domain. We conclude that PakB plays a critical role in regulating the cellular functions of dAbp1, which are mediated largely by its SH3 domain.",

        "abstract": "Chemotactic eukaryote cells can sense chemical gradients over a wide range of concentrations via heterotrimeric G-protein signaling; however, the underlying wide-range sensing mechanisms are only partially understood. Here we report that a novel regulator of G proteins, G protein-interacting protein 1 (Gip1), is essential for extending the chemotactic range ofDictyosteliumcells. Genetic disruption of Gip1 caused severe defects in gradient sensing and directed cell migration at high but not low concentrations of chemoattractant. Also, Gip1 was found to bind and sequester G proteins in cytosolic pools. Receptor activation induced G-protein translocation to the plasma membrane from the cytosol in a Gip1-dependent manner, causing a biased redistribution of G protein on the membrane along a chemoattractant gradient. These findings suggest that Gip1 regulates G-protein shuttling between the cytosol and the membrane to ensure the availability and biased redistribution of G protein on the membrane for receptor-mediated chemotactic signaling. This mechanism offers an explanation for the wide-range sensing seen in eukaryotic chemotaxis.",

Villidin mRNA and protein are present in low amounts during growth and early aggregation, but increase during development and reach their highest levels at the tipped mound stage. The protein is present in the cytosol as well as in the cytoskeletal and membrane fractions. GFP-tagged full-length villidin exhibits a similar distribution as native villidin, including a distinct colocalization with Golgi structures. Interestingly, GFP fusions with the gelsolin/villin-like region are uniformly dispersed in the cytoplasm, whereas GFP fusions of the N-terminal WD repeats codistribute with F-actin and are associated with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton. Strains lacking villidin because of targeted deletion of its gene grow normally and can develop into fruiting bodies. However, cell motility is reduced during aggregation and phototaxis is impaired in the mutant strains. We conclude that villidin harbors a major F-actin binding site in the N-terminal domain and not in the villin-like region as expected; association of villidin with vesicular membranes suggests that the protein functions as a linker between membranes and the actin cytoskeleton.",

MPBD, the product of the polyketide synthase encoded by stlA, regulates stalk and spore differentiation by rapidly stimulating the release of the phosphopeptide SDF-1. By analyzing specific mutants affected in MPBD or SDF-1 production, we delineated a signal transduction cascade through the membrane receptor CrlA coupled to G\u03b11, leading to the inhibition of GskA so that the precursor of SDF-1 is released. It is then processed by the extracellular protease of TagB on prestalk cells. SDF-1 apparently acts through the adenylyl cyclase ACG to activate the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and trigger the production of more SDF-1. This signaling cascade shows similarities to the SDF-2 signaling pathway, which acts later to induce rapid spore encapsulation.",

        "abstract": "The \u03b1-kinases are a widely expressed family of serine/threonine protein kinases that exhibit no sequence identity with conventional eukaryotic protein kinases. In this report, we provide new information on the catalytic properties of the \u03b1-kinase domain of Dictyostelium myosin-II heavy chain kinase-A (termed A-CAT). Crystallization of A-CAT in the presence of MgATP yielded structures with AMP or adenosine in the catalytic cleft together with a phosphorylated Asp-766 residue. The results show that the \u03b2- and \u03b1-phosphoryl groups are transferred either directly or indirectly to the catalytically essential Asp-766. Biochemical assays confirmed that A-CAT hydrolyzed ATP, ADP, and AMP with kcat values of 1.9, 0.6, and 0.32 min(-1), respectively, and showed that A-CAT can use ADP to phosphorylate peptides and proteins. Binding assays using fluorescent 2'/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) analogs of ATP and ADP yielded Kd values for ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine of 20 \u00b1 3, 60 \u00b1 20, 160 \u00b1 60, and 45 \u00b1 15 \u03bcM, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Glu-713, Leu-716, and Lys-645, all of which interact with the adenine base, were critical for nucleotide binding. Mutation of the highly conserved Gln-758, which chelates a nucleotide-associated Mg(2+) ion, eliminated catalytic activity, whereas loss of the highly conserved Lys-722 and Arg-592 decreased kcat values for kinase and ATPase activities by 3-6-fold. Mutation of Asp-663 impaired kinase activity to a much greater extent than ATPase, indicating a specific role in peptide substrate binding, whereas mutation of Gln-768 doubled ATPase activity, suggesting that it may act to exclude water from the active site.",

Tyr-53 phosphorylation substantially, if not completely, inhibits nucleation and elongation from the pointed end of actin filaments and reduces the rate of elongation from the barbed end. Negatively stained electron microscopic images of polymerized Tyr-53-phosphorylated actin show a variable mixture of small oligomers and filaments, which are converted to more typical, long filaments upon addition of myosin subfragment 1. Tyr-53-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin copolymerize in vitro, and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin colocalize in amoebae.

By connecting the lower and upper 50 kDa domains of myosin, the crosslink restricts the conformation of the actin-binding cleft. Crosslinking has no effect on the basal ATPase activity of isolated myosin, but it impairs rigor actin binding and actin-activation of myosin ATPase. EPR spectra of BSL provide insight into actomyosin structural dynamics. BSL is highly immobilized within the actin-binding cleft and is thus exquisitely sensitive to the global orientation and rotational motions of the myosin head. Conventional EPR shows that myosin heads bound to oriented actin filaments are highly disordered with respect to the actin filament axis, in contrast to the nearly crystalline order of myosin heads in rigor. This disorder is similar to that of weakly bound heads induced by ATP, but saturation transfer EPR shows that the disorder of crosslinked myosin is at least 100 times slower. Thus this cleft-crosslinked myosin is remarkably similar, in both actin affinity and rotational dynamics, to SH1-SH2 crosslinked BSL-myosin S1. We conclude that, whether myosin is trapped at the actin-myosin interface or in the force-generating region between the active site and lever arm, the structural state of myosin is intermediate between the weak-binding state preceding phosphate release and the strong-binding state that succeeds it. We propose that it represents the threshold of force generation.",

Infected host cells generate double-membrane autophagosomes that mature in autolysosomes to engulf, kill and digest cytoplasmic pathogens. However, several bacteria subvert autophagy and benefit from its machinery and functions. Monitoring infection stages by genetics, pharmacology and microscopy, we demonstrate that the ESX-1 secretion system of Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative to M. tuberculosis, upregulates the transcription of autophagy genes, and stimulates autophagosome formation and recruitment to the mycobacteria-containing vacuole (MCV) in the host model organism Dictyostelium. Antagonistically, ESX-1 is also essential to block the autophagic flux and deplete the MCV of proteolytic activity. Activators of the TORC1 complex localize to the MCV in an ESX-1-dependent manner, suggesting an important role in the manipulation of autophagy by mycobacteria. Our findings suggest that the infection by M. marinum activates an autophagic response that is simultaneously repressed and exploited by the bacterium to support its survival inside the MCV.",

Protein oxidation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is critical for normal cellular function, but oxidative stress has been implicated in disease progression and biological aging. Our goal is to bridge understanding of protein oxidation and muscle dysfunction with molecular-level insights into actomyosin interaction. In order to focus on methionine oxidation and to facilitate site-directed spectroscopy, we started with a Cys-lite version of Dicty myosin II. For Dicty myosin containing native methionines, peroxide treatment decreased actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, consistent with the decline in actomyosin function previously observed in biologically aged or peroxide-treated muscle. Methionine-to-leucine mutations, used to protect specific sites from oxidation, identified a single methionine that is functionally sensitive to oxidation: M394, near the myosin cardiomyopathy loop in the actin-binding interface. Previously characterized myosin labeling sites for spectroscopy in the force-producing region and actin-binding cleft were examined; spin-label mobility and distance measurements in the actin-binding cleft were sensitive to oxidation, but particularly in the presence of actin. Overall secondary structure and thermal stability were unaffected by oxidation. We conclude that the oxidation-induced structural change in myosin includes a redistribution of existing structural states of the actin-binding cleft. These results will be applicable to the many biological and therapeutic contexts in which a detailed understanding of protein oxidation as well as function and structure relationships is sought.",

Here, we develop a computational model of cellular mechanics, and using a large number of experimentally measured biophysical parameters, we simulate cell division under a number of different scenarios. We demonstrate that traction-mediated protrusive forces or contractile forces due to myosin II are sufficient to initiate furrow ingression. Furthermore, we show that passive forces due to the cell's cortical tension and surface curvature allow the furrow to complete ingression. We compare quantitatively the furrow thinning trajectories obtained from simulation with those observed experimentally in both wild-type and myosin II null Dictyostelium cells. Our simulations highlight the relative contributions of different biomechanical subsystems to cell shape progression during cell division.",

        "abstract": "Skp1 is a conserved protein linking cullin-1 to F-box proteins in SCF (<u>S</u>kp1/<u>C</u>ullin-1/<u>F</u>-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which modify protein substrates with polyubiquitin chains that typically target them for 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. In <i>Dictyostelium</i> (a social amoeba), <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (the agent for human toxoplasmosis), and other protists, Skp1 is regulated by a unique pentasaccharide attached to hydroxylated Pro-143 within its C-terminal F-box-binding domain. Prolyl hydroxylation of Skp1 contributes to O<sub>2</sub>-dependent <i>Dictyostelium</i> development, but full glycosylation at that position is required for optimal O<sub>2</sub> sensing. Previous studies have shown that the glycan promotes organization of the F-box-binding region in Skp1 and aids in Skp1's association with F-box proteins. Here, NMR and MS approaches were used to determine the glycan structure, and then a combination of NMR and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to characterize the impact of the glycan on the conformation and motions of the intrinsically flexible F-box-binding domain of Skp1. Molecular dynamics trajectories of glycosylated Skp1 whose calculated monosaccharide relaxation kinetics and rotational correlation times agreed with the NMR data indicated that the glycan interacts with the loop connecting two \u03b1-helices of the F-box-combining site. In these trajectories, the helices separated from one another to create a more accessible and dynamic F-box interface. These results offer an unprecedented view of how a glycan modification influences a disordered region of a full-length protein. The increased sampling of an open Skp1 conformation can explain how glycosylation enhances interactions with F-box proteins in cells.",

For example, although histones are modified by ARTs, the sites on these proteins ADP-ribosylated following DNA damage and the ARTs that catalyse these events are unknown. This, in part, is due to the lack of a eukaryotic model that contains ARTs, in addition to histone genes that can be manipulated to assess ADP-ribosylation events in vivo. Here we exploit the model Dictyostelium to identify site-specific histone ADP-ribosylation events in vivo and define the ARTs that mediate these modifications. Dictyostelium histones are modified in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo by the ARTs Adprt1a and Adprt2. Adprt1a is a mono-ART that modifies H2BE18 in vitro, although disruption of this site allows ADP-ribosylation at H2BE19. Although redundancy between H2BE18 and H2BE19 ADP-ribosylation is also apparent following DSBs in vivo, by generating a strain with mutations at E18/E19 in the h2b locus we demonstrate these are the principal sites modified by Adprt1a/Adprt2. This identifies DNA damage induced histone mono-ADP-ribosylation sites by specific ARTs in vivo, providing a unique platform to assess how histone ADP-ribosylation regulates DNA repair.",

        "abstract": "The coordinated motion of a cell is fundamental to many important biological processes such as development, wound healing, and phagocytosis. For eukaryotic cells, such as amoebae or animal cells, the cell motility is based on crawling and involves a complex set of internal biochemical events. A recent study reported very interesting crawling behavior of single cell amoeba: in the absence of an external cue, free amoebae move randomly with a noisy, yet, discernible sequence of 'run-and-turns' analogous to the 'run-and-tumbles' of swimming bacteria. Interestingly, amoeboid trajectories favor zigzag turns. In other words, the cells bias their crawling by making a turn in the opposite direction to a previous turn. This property enhances the long range directional persistence of the moving trajectories. This study proposes that such a zigzag crawling behavior can be a general property of any crawling cells by demonstrating that 1) microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, and 2) a simple rule-based model cell, which incorporates the actual biochemistry and mechanics behind cell crawling, both exhibit similar type of crawling behavior. Almost all legged animals walk by alternating their feet. Similarly, all crawling cells appear to move forward by alternating the direction of their movement, even though the regularity and degree of zigzag preference vary from one type to the other.",

The mechanism by which actin accumulates at the wound site, the types of actin-related proteins participating in the actin remodeling, and their signaling pathways are unclear. We firstly examined how actin accumulates at a wound site in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. Actin assembled de novo at the wound site, independent of cortical flow. Next, we searched for actin- and signal-related proteins targeting the wound site. Fourteen of the examined proteins transiently accumulated at different times. Thirdly, we performed functional analyses using gene knockout mutants or specific inhibitors. Rac, WASP, formin, the Arp2/3 complex, profilin, and coronin contribute to the actin dynamics. Finally, we found that multiple signaling pathways related to TORC2, the Elmo/Doc complex, PIP2-derived products, PLA2, and calmodulin are involved in the actin dynamics for wound repair.",

Eukaryotic cells can sense a concentration difference as low as a few per cent across their bodies. This process was previously suggested to be limited by the receptor-ligand binding fluctuations. Here, we first determine the chemotaxis response of Dictyostelium cells to static folic acid gradients and show that they can significantly exceed this sensitivity, responding to gradients as shallow as 0.2% across the cell body. Second, using a previously developed information theory framework, we compare the total information gained about the gradient (based on the cell response) to its upper limit: the information gained at the receptor-ligand binding step. We find that the model originally applied to cAMP sensing fails as demonstrated by the violation of the data processing inequality, i.e. the total information exceeds the information at the receptor-ligand binding step. We propose an extended model with multiple known receptor types and with cells allowed to perform several independent measurements of receptor occupancy. This does not violate the data processing inequality and implies the receptor-ligand binding noise dominates both for low- and high-chemoattractant concentrations. We also speculate that the interplay between exploration and exploitation is used as a strategy for accurate sensing of otherwise unmeasurable levels of a chemoattractant.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelid cellular slime molds (dictyostelids) are protists that are common inhabitants of most soils, where they feed upon bacteria. Changbai Mountain is the highest mountain in northeast China. Soil samples collected on Changbai Mountain yielded 11 isolates representing six species of dictyostelid samples. Two of these species (<i>Dictyostelium robusticaule</i> and <i>Heterostelium recretum</i>) were found to be new to science, based on morphology, SSU rDNA sequences, and an ATPase subunit 1 gene (<i>atp1</i>) phylogeny. The present study also demonstrated that the increased accuracy and lower costs associated with the use of <i>atp1</i> sequences make them a complement of SSU rDNA sequences for identifying dictyostelids. Changbai Mountain is characterized by a higher diversity of dictyostelids than indicated by the few previous reports. Moreover, the data for Changbai Mountain, compared with comparable data for Taiwan, suggest that differences in diversity at the family level are possibly related to latitude. Mixed broadleaf-conifer forests produced more isolates and species than broadleaf forests at the same elevation and also had the highest species richness, which indicates an effect of vegetation on dictyostelids. However, the pattern of slightly decreasing diversity with increasing elevation in dictyostelids was also apparent. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> <i>Dictyostelium robusticaule</i> and <i>Heterostelium recretum</i> are two new species of dictyostelids reported in this study. The potential use of <i>atp1</i> sequences is a complement of SSU rDNA sequences for the identifying dictyostelids. A pattern of slightly decreasing diversity with increasing elevation in dictyostelids was observed, with the conditions that exist at lower elevations apparently more suitable for dictyostelids, whereas differences of diversity observed at the family level are possibly related to latitude.",

By interrogating a library of ordered YAC clones, we provide evidence for a chromosomal copy of the rDNA on chromosome 4. This locus may provide master copies for the stable transmission of the extrachromosomal elements. The extrachromosomal elements were also found to form chromosome-sized clusters of DNA within nuclei of nocodazole-treated cells arrested in mitosis.

The directional sensing mechanisms responsible for this response to EFs, however, remain unknown. Exposing cells to an EF causes changes in plasma membrane potentials (V(m)). Exploiting the ability of Dictyostelium cells to tolerate drastic V(m) changes, we investigated the role of V(m) in electrotaxis and, in parallel, in chemotaxis. We used three independent factors to control V(m): extracellular pH, extracellular [K(+)], and electroporation. Changes in V(m) were monitored with microelectrode recording techniques. Depolarized V(m) was observed under acidic (pH 5.0) and alkaline (pH 9.0) conditions as well as under higher extracellular [K(+)] conditions. Electroporation permeabilized the cell membrane and significantly reduced the V(m), which gradually recovered over 40 min. We then recorded the electrotactic behaviors of Dictyostelium cells with a defined V(m) using these three techniques. The directionality (directedness of electrotaxis) was quantified and compared to that of chemotaxis (chemotactic index). We found that a reduced V(m) significantly impaired electrotaxis without significantly affecting random motility or chemotaxis. We conclude that extracellular pH, [K(+)], and electroporation all significantly affected electrotaxis, which appeared to be mediated by the changes in V(m). The initial directional sensing mechanisms for electrotaxis therefore differ from those of chemotaxis and may be mediated by changes in resting V(m).",

These areas differ in composition of actin-associated proteins and of phosphoinositides in the membrane. At the propagating wave, one area is converted into the other. By photo-conversion of Eos-actin and analysis of actin network structures we show that both in the inner territory and the external area the actin network is subject to continuous turnover. To address the question of whether areas in the wave pattern are specified by particular actin polymerizing machines, we locate five members of the formin family to specific regions of the wave landscape using TIRF microscopy and constitutively active formin constructs tagged with fluorescent protein. Formin ForB favors the actin wave and ForG the inner territory, whereas ForA, ForE, and ForH are more strongly recruited to the external area. Fluctuations of membrane binding peculiar to ForB indicate transient states in the specification of membrane domains before differentiation into ForB decorated and depleted ones. Annihilation of the patterns by 1 \u00b5M of the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 supports the implication of formins in their generation.",

We use light-sheet microscopy to define an underlying set of principles by which macropinocytic cups are shaped and closed in Dictyostelium amoebae. Cups form around domains of PIP3 stretching almost to their lip and are supported by a specialized F-actin scaffold from lip to base. They are shaped by a ring of actin polymerization created by recruiting Scar/WAVE and Arp2/3 around PIP3 domains, but how cups evolve over time to close and form a vesicle is unknown. Custom 3D analysis shows that PIP3 domains expand from small origins, capturing new membrane into the cup, and crucially, that cups close when domain expansion stalls. We show that cups can close in two ways: either at the lip, by inwardly directed actin polymerization, or the base, by stretching and delamination of the membrane. This provides the basis for a conceptual mechanism whereby closure is brought about by a combination of stalled cup expansion, continued actin polymerization at the lip, and membrane tension. We test this through the use of a biophysical model, which can recapitulate both forms of cup closure and explain how 3D cup structures evolve over time to mediate engulfment.",

        "abstract": "Actin polymerization is typically initiated at specific sites in a cell by membrane-bound protein complexes, and the resulting structures are involved in specialized cellular functions, such as migration, particle uptake, or mitotic division. Here we analyze the potential of the actin system to self-organize into waves that propagate on the planar, substrate-attached membrane of a cell. We show that self-assembly involves the ordered recruitment of proteins from the cytoplasmic pool and relate the organization of actin waves to their capacity for applying force. Three proteins are shown to form distinct three-dimensional patterns in the actin waves. Myosin-IB is enriched at the wave front and close to the plasma membrane, the Arp2/3 complex is distributed throughout the waves, and coronin forms a sloping layer on top of them. CARMIL, a protein that links myosin-IB to the Arp2/3 complex, is also recruited to the waves. Wave formation does not depend on signals transmitted by heterotrimeric G-proteins, nor does their propagation require SCAR, a regulator upstream of the Arp2/3 complex. Propagation of the waves is based on an actin treadmilling mechanism, indicating a program that couples actin assembly to disassembly in a three-dimensional pattern. When waves impinge on the cell perimeter, they push the edge forward; when they reverse direction, the cell border is paralyzed. These data show that force-generating, highly organized supramolecular networks are autonomously formed in live cells from molecular motors and proteins controlling actin polymerization and depolymerization.",

        "abstract": "The signaling pathways governing pathophysiologically important autophagic (ACD) and necrotic (NCD) cell death are not entirely known. In the Dictyostelium eukaryote model, which benefits from both unique analytical and genetic advantages and absence of potentially interfering apoptotic machinery, the differentiation factor DIF leads from starvation-induced autophagy to ACD, or, if atg1 is inactivated, to NCD. Here, through random insertional mutagenesis, we found that inactivation of the iplA gene, the only gene encoding an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in this organism, prevented ACD. The IP3R is a ligand-gated channel governing Ca(2+) efflux from endoplasmic reticulum stores to the cytosol. Accordingly, Ca(2+)-related drugs also affected DIF signaling leading to ACD. Thus, in this system, a main pathway signaling ACD requires IP3R and further Ca(2+)-dependent steps. This is one of the first insights in the molecular understanding of a signaling pathway leading to autophagic cell death.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis is the ability to migrate towards the source of chemical gradients. It underlies the ability of neutrophils and other immune cells to hone in on their targets and defend against invading pathogens. Given the importance of neutrophil migration to health and disease, it is crucial to understand the basic mechanisms controlling chemotaxis so that strategies can be developed to modulate cell migration in clinical settings. Because of the complexity of human genetics, Dictyostelium and HL60 cells have long served as models system for studying chemotaxis. Since many of our current insights into chemotaxis have been gained from these two model systems, we decided to compare them side by side in a set of winner-take-all races, the Dicty World Races. These worldwide competitions challenge researchers to genetically engineer and pharmacologically enhance the model systems to compete in microfluidic racecourses. These races bring together technological innovations in genetic engineering and precision measurement of cell motility. Fourteen teams participated in the inaugural Dicty World Race 2014 and contributed cell lines, which they tuned for enhanced speed and chemotactic accuracy. The race enabled large-scale analyses of chemotaxis in complex environments and revealed an intriguing balance of speed and accuracy of the model cell lines. The successes of the first race validated the concept of using fun-spirited competition to gain insights into the complex mechanisms controlling chemotaxis, while the challenges of the first race will guide further technological development and planning of future events.",

We examined the influx of fluorescent dyes from the external medium and monitored the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> after wounding. The influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the wound pore was essential for wound repair. Annexin and ESCRT components accumulated at the wound site upon wounding as previously described in animal cells, but these were not essential for wound repair in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. We discovered that calmodulin accumulated at the wound site upon wounding, which was essential for wound repair. The membrane accumulated at the wound site to plug the wound pore by two-steps, depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and calmodulin. From several lines of evidence, the membrane plug was derived from de novo generated vesicles at the wound site. Actin filaments also accumulated at the wound site, depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and calmodulin. Actin accumulation was essential for wound repair, but microtubules were not essential. A molecular mechanism of wound repair will be discussed.",

RacC is a Dictyostelium orthologue of Cdc42. We identified a streaming defect of racC(-) cells as they are clearly less polarized and form smaller and fragmented streams. ACA-YFP is mainly associated with intracellular vesicular structures, but not with the plasma membrane in racC(-) cells. racC(-) cells have a slightly higher number of vesicles than Ax3 cells, suggesting that the defect of ACA trafficking is not simply due to the lack of vesicle formation. While the ACA-YFP vesicles traveled with an average velocity of 9.1 \u03bcm/min in Ax3 cells, a slow and diffusional movement without direction with an average velocity of 4 \u03bcm/min was maintained in racC(-) cells. Images acquired by using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis revealed that a significantly decreased number of ACA-YFP vesicles appeared near the cell membrane, indicating a defect in ACA-YFP vesicle trafficking. These results suggest an important role of RacC in the rapid and directional movements of ACA vesicles on microtubules to the plasma membrane, especially to the back of polarized cell.",

We show here that a 283-residue protein, assembly domain (AD)1, corresponding to the AD in the tail of Dictyostelium myosin II assembles into bundles of long tubules when expressed in myosin II-null cells and localizes to the cleavage furrow of dividing cells. AD1 mutants that do not polymerize in vitro do not go to the cleavage furrow in vivo. An assembly-competent polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 256 residues of Acanthamoeba myosin II also goes to the cleavage furrow of Dictyostelium myosin II-null cells. When overexpressed in wild-type cells, AD1 colocalizes with endogenous myosin II (possibly as a copolymer) in interphase, motile, and dividing cells and under caps of Con A receptors but has no effect on myosin II-dependent functions. These results suggest that neither a specific sequence, other than that required for polymerization, nor interaction with other proteins is required for localization of myosin II to the cleavage furrow.",

In general, <i>Francisella</i> growth depends on iron availability, hence, iron homeostasis must be tightly regulated during <i>Francisella</i> infection. We used the system of the professional phagocyte <i>Dictyostelium</i> and the fish pathogen <i>F. noatunensis</i> subsp. <i>noatunensis</i> (<i>F.n.n</i>.) to investigate the role of the host cell iron transporters Nramp (natural resistance associated macrophage proteins) during <i>Francisella</i> infection. Like its mammalian ortholog, <i>Dictyostelium</i> Nramp1 transports iron from the phagosome into the cytosol, whereas the paralog NrampB is located on the contractile vacuole and controls, together with Nramp1, the cellular iron homeostasis. In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, Nramp1 localized to the <i>F.n.n</i>.-phagosome but disappeared from the compartment dependent on the presence of IglC, an established <i>Francisella</i> virulence factor. In the absence of Nramp transporters the bacteria translocated more efficiently from the phagosome into the host cell cytosol, its replicative niche. Increased escape rates coincided with increased proteolytic activity in bead-containing phagosomes indicating a role of the Nramp transporters for phagosomal maturation. In the <i>nramp</i> mutants, a higher bacterial load was observed in the replicative phase compared to wild-type host cells. Upon bacterial access to the cytosol of wt cells, mRNA levels of bacterial iron uptake factors were transiently upregulated. Decreased iron levels in the <i>nramp</i> mutants were compensated by a prolonged upregulation of the iron scavenging system. These results show that Nramps contribute to host cell immunity against <i>Francisella</i> infection by influencing the translocation efficiency from the phagosome to the cytosol but not by restricting access to nutritional iron in the cytosol.",

        "abstract": "The Dictyostelium genome encodes only two MAPKs, Erk1 and Erk2, and both are expressed during growth and development. Reduced levels of Erk2 expression have been shown previously to restrict cAMP production during development but still allow for chemotactic movement. In this study the erk2 gene was disrupted to eliminate Erk2 function. The absence of Erk2 resulted in a complete loss of folate and cAMP chemotaxis suggesting that this MAPK plays an integral role in the signaling mechanisms involved with this cellular response. However, folate stimulation of early chemotactic responses, such as Ras and PI3K activation and rapid actin filament formation, were not affected by the loss of Erk2 function. The erk2<sup>-</sup> cells had a severe defect in growth on bacterial lawns but assays of bacterial cell engulfment displayed only subtle changes in the rate of bacterial engulfment. Only cells with no MAPK function, erk1<sup>-</sup>erk2<sup>-</sup> double mutants, displayed a severe proliferation defect in axenic medium. Loss of Erk2 impaired the phosphorylation of Erk1 in secondary responses to folate stimulation indicating that Erk2 has a role in the regulation of Erk1 activation during chemotaxis. Loss of the only known Dictyostelium MAPK kinase, MekA, prevented the phosphorylation of Erk1 but not Erk2 in response to folate and cAMP confirming that Erk2 is not regulated by a conventional MAP2K. This lack of MAP2K phosphorylation of Erk2 and the sequence similarity of Erk2 to mammalian MAPK15 (Erk8) suggest that the Dictyostelium Erk2 belongs to a group of atypical MAPKs. MAPK activation has been observed in chemotactic responses in a wide range of organisms but this study demonstrates an essential role for MAPK function in chemotactic movement. This study also confirms that MAPKs provide critical contributions to cell proliferation.",

The motor domain is modeled in the pre-powerstroke state, in the post-rigor state, and as a hybrid based on the post-rigor state with a closed nucleotide-binding pocket. The ATP hydrolysis activity is found to depend on the positioning of nearby water molecules, and a network of polar residues facilitates proton transfer and charge redistribution during hydrolysis. Comparison of the observed hydrolysis pathways and the corresponding free energy profiles leads to detailed models for the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in the pre-powerstroke state and proposes factors that regulate the hydrolysis activity in different conformational states. In the pre-powerstroke state, the scissile P<sub>\u03b3</sub>-O<sub>3\u03b2</sub> bond breaks early in the reaction. Proton transfer from the lytic water to the \u03b3-phosphate through active site residues is an important part of the kinetic bottleneck; several hydrolysis pathways that feature distinct proton transfer routes are found to have similar free energy barriers, suggesting a significant degree of plasticity in the hydrolysis mechanism. Comparison of hydrolysis in the pre-powerstroke state and the closed post-rigor model suggests that optimization of residues beyond the active site for electrostatic stabilization and preorganization is likely important to enzyme design.",

        "abstract": "ADP-ribosylation by ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) has a well-established role in DNA strand break repair by promoting enrichment of repair factors at damage sites through ADP-ribose interaction domains. Here, we exploit the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium to uncover a role for ADP-ribosylation in regulating DNA interstrand crosslink repair and redundancy of this pathway with non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). In silico searches were used to identify a protein that contains a permutated macrodomain (which we call aprataxin/APLF-and-PNKP-like protein; APL). Structural analysis reveals that this permutated macrodomain retains features associated with ADP-ribose interactions and that APL is capable of binding poly(ADP-ribose) through this macrodomain. APL is enriched in chromatin in response to cisplatin treatment, an agent that induces DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). This is dependent on the macrodomain of APL and the ART Adprt2, indicating a role for ADP-ribosylation in the cellular response to cisplatin. Although adprt2<sup>-</sup> cells are sensitive to cisplatin, ADP-ribosylation is evident in these cells owing to redundant signalling by the double-strand break (DSB)-responsive ART Adprt1a, promoting NHEJ-mediated repair. These data implicate ADP-ribosylation in DNA ICL repair and identify that NHEJ can function to resolve this form of DNA damage in the absence of Adprt2.",

        "abstract": "Cullins function as scaffolds that, along with F-box/WD40-repeat-containing proteins, mediate the ubiquitination of proteins to target them for degradation by the proteasome. We have identified a cullin CulA that is required at several stages during Dictyostelium development. culA null cells are defective in inducing cell-type-specific gene expression and exhibit defects during aggregation, including reduced chemotaxis. PKA is an important regulator of Dictyostelium development. The levels of intracellular cAMP and PKA activity are controlled by the rate of synthesis of cAMP and its degradation by the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase RegA. We show that overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAcat) rescues many of the culA null defects and those of cells lacking FbxA/ChtA, a previously described F-box/WD40-repeat-containing protein, suggesting CulA and FbxA proteins are involved in regulating PKA function. Whereas RegA protein levels drop as the multicellular organism forms in the wild-type strain, they remain high in culA null and fbxA null cells. Although PKA can suppress the culA and fbxA null developmental phenotypes, it does not suppress the altered RegA degradation, suggesting that PKA lies downstream of RegA, CulA, and FbxA. Finally, we show that CulA, FbxA, and RegA are found in a complex in vivo, and formation of this complex is dependent on the MAP kinase ERK2, which is also required for PKA function. We propose that CulA and FbxA regulate multicellular development by targeting RegA for degradation via a pathway that requires ERK2 function, leading to an increase in cAMP and PKA activity.",

        "abstract": "Experiments with insects, protozoa, nematodes, and slime molds have recently come to the forefront in the study of host-fungal interactions. Many of the virulence factors required for pathogenicity in mammals are also important for fungal survival during interactions with non-vertebrate hosts, suggesting that fungal virulence may have evolved, and been maintained, as a countermeasure to environmental predation by amoebae and nematodes and other small non-vertebrates that feed on microorganisms. Host innate immune responses are also broadly conserved across many phyla. The study of the interaction between invertebrate model hosts and pathogenic fungi therefore provides insights into the mechanisms underlying pathogen virulence and host immunity, and complements the use of mammalian models by enabling whole-animal high throughput infection assays. This review aims to assist researchers in identifying appropriate invertebrate systems for the study of particular aspects of fungal pathogenesis.",

In the present study, we performed a whole-cell based screen in order to complete the characterization of 168 compounds from the GlaxoSmithKline TB-set. We have established and utilized novel previously unexplored host-model systems to characterize the GSK compounds, i.e. the amoeboid organisms D. discoideum and A. castellanii, as well as a microglial phagocytic cell line, BV2. We infected these host cells with Mycobacterium marinum to monitor and characterize the anti-infective activity of the compounds with quantitative fluorescence measurements and high-content microscopy. In summary, 88.1% of the compounds were confirmed as antibiotics against M. marinum, 11.3% and 4.8% displayed strong anti-infective activity in, respectively, the mammalian and protozoan infection models. Additionally, in the two systems, 13-14% of the compounds displayed pro-infective activity. Our studies underline the relevance of using evolutionarily distant pathogen and host models in order to reveal conserved mechanisms of virulence and defence, respectively, which are potential \"universal\" targets for intervention. Subsequent mechanism of action studies based on generation of over-expresser M. bovis BCG strains, generation of spontaneous resistant mutants and whole genome sequencing revealed four new molecular targets, including FbpA, MurC, MmpL3 and GlpK.",

        "abstract": "Migratory cells, including mammalian leukocytes and Dictyostelium, use G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling to regulate MAPK/ERK, PI3K, TORC2/AKT, adenylyl cyclase and actin polymerization, which collectively direct chemotaxis. Upon ligand binding, mammalian GPCRs are phosphorylated at cytoplasmic residues, uncoupling G-protein pathways, but activating other pathways. However, connections between GPCR phosphorylation and chemotaxis are unclear. In developing Dictyostelium, secreted cAMP serves as a chemoattractant, with extracellular cAMP propagated as oscillating waves to ensure directional migratory signals. cAMP oscillations derive from transient excitatory responses of adenylyl cyclase, which then rapidly adapts. We have studied chemotactic signaling in Dictyostelium that express non-phosphorylatable cAMP receptors and show through chemotaxis modeling, single-cell FRET imaging, pure and chimeric population wavelet quantification, biochemical analyses and TIRF microscopy, that receptor phosphorylation is required to regulate adenylyl cyclase adaptation, long-range oscillatory cAMP wave production and cytoskeletal actin response. Phosphorylation defects thus promote hyperactive actin polymerization at the cell periphery, misdirected pseudopodia and the loss of directional chemotaxis. Our data indicate that chemoattractant receptor phosphorylation is required to co-regulate essential pathways for migratory cell polarization and chemotaxis. Our results significantly extend the understanding of the function of GPCR phosphorylation, providing strong evidence that this evolutionarily conserved mechanism is required in a signal attenuation pathway that is necessary to maintain persistent directional movement of Dictyostelium, neutrophils and other migratory cells.",

        "abstract": "O(2) sensing in diverse protozoa depends on the prolyl 4 hydroxylation of Skp1 and modification of the resulting hydroxyproline with a series of five sugars. In yeast, plants, and animals, Skp1 is associated with F-box proteins. The Skp1-F-box protein heterodimer can, for many F-box proteins, dock onto cullin-1 en route to assembly of the Skp1-cullin-1-F-box protein-Rbx1 subcomplex of E3(SCF)Ub ligases. E3(SCF)Ub ligases conjugate Lys48-polyubiquitin chains onto targets bound to the substrate receptor domains of F-box proteins, preparing them for recognition by the 26S proteasome. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, we found that O(2) availability was rate-limiting for the hydroxylation of newly synthesized Skp1. To investigate the effect of reduced hydroxylation, we analyzed knockout mutants of the Skp1 prolyl hydroxylase and each of the Skp1 glycosyltransferases. Proteomic analysis of co-immunoprecipitates showed that wild-type cells able to fully glycosylate Skp1 had a greater abundance of an SCF complex containing the cullin-1 homolog CulE and FbxD, a newly described WD40-type F-box protein, than the complexes that predominate in cells defective in Skp1 hydroxylation or glycosylation. Similarly, the previously described FbxA-Skp1CulA complex was also more abundant in glycosylation-competent cells. The CulE interactome also included higher levels of proteasomal regulatory particles when Skp1 was glycosylated, suggesting increased activity consistent with greater association with F-box proteins. Finally, the interactome of FLAG-FbxD was modified when it harbored an F-box mutation that compromised Skp1 binding, consistent with an effect on the abundance of potential substrate proteins. We propose that O(2)-dependent posttranslational glycosylation of Skp1 promotes association with F-box proteins and their engagement in functional E3(SCF)Ub ligases that regulate O(2)-dependent developmental progression.",

        "abstract": "Cells are consistently subjected to wounding by physical or chemical damages from the external environment. We previously showed that a local wound of the cell membrane modulates the polarity of cell migration and the wounded cells escape from the wound site in Dictyostelium. Here, we examined effects of wounds on dividing cells. When the cell membrane at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis was locally wounded using laserporation, furrow constriction was significantly accelerated. Neither myosin II nor cortexillins contributed to the acceleration, because the acceleration was not hindered in mutant cells deficient in these proteins. When the cell membrane outside the furrow was wounded, the furrow constriction was not accelerated. Instead, the wounded-daughter half became smaller and the unwounded half became larger, resulting in an asymmetrical cell division. These phenomena occurred independently of wound repair. When cells in anaphase were wounded at the presumptive polar region, about 30% of the wounded cells changed\u00a0the orientation of the division axis. From these observations, we concluded that dividing cells also escape from the wound site. The wound experiments on dividing cells also provide new insights into the mechanism of cytokinesis and cell polarity establishment.",

Here using cryo-electron microscopy we directly observe the structure of Dictyostelium discoideum dynein dimers on microtubules at near-physiological ATP concentrations. They display remarkable flexibility at a hinge close to the microtubule binding domain (the stalkhead) producing a wide range of head positions. About half the molecules have the two heads separated from one another, with both leading and trailing motors attached to the microtubule. The other half have the two heads and stalks closely superposed in a front-to-back arrangement of the AAA(+) rings, suggesting specific contact between the heads. All stalks point towards the microtubule minus end. Mean stalk angles depend on the separation between their stalkheads, which allows estimation of inter-head tension. These findings provide a structural framework for understanding dynein's directionality and unusual stepping behaviour.",

Several subfamilies exist, but their regulation and physiological roles are not well understood, nor is it even known if all subfamilies have been identified. Our extensive search reveals few novel WASP family proteins. The WASP, WASH, and SCAR/WAVE subfamilies are evolutionarily ancient, with WASH the most universally present, whereas WHAMM/JMY first appears in invertebrates. An unusual Dictyostelium WASP homologue that has lost the WH1 domain has retained its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, demonstrating that WASPs can function with a remarkably diverse domain topology. The WASH and SCAR/WAVE regulatory complexes are much more rigidly maintained; their domain topology is highly conserved, and all subunits are present or lost together, showing that the complexes are ancient and functionally interdependent. Finally, each subfamily has a distinctive C motif, indicating that this motif plays a specific role in each subfamily's function, unlike the generic V and A motifs. Our analysis identifies which features are universally conserved, and thus essential, and which are branch-specific modifications. It also shows the WASP family is more widespread and diverse than currently appreciated and unexpectedly biases the physiological role of the Arp2/3 complex toward vesicle traffic.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) functions as the extracellular chemoattractant in the aggregation phase of Dictyostelium development. There is some question, however, concerning what role, if any, it plays intracellularly in motility and chemotaxis. To test for such a role, the behavior of null mutants of acaA, the adenylyl cyclase gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for cAMP synthesis during aggregation, was analyzed in buffer and in response to experimentally generated spatial and temporal gradients of extracellular cAMP. acaA- cells were defective in suppressing lateral pseudopods in response to a spatial gradient of cAMP and to an increasing temporal gradient of cAMP. acaA- cells were incapable of chemotaxis in natural waves of cAMP generated by majority control cells in mixed cultures. These results indicate that intracellular cAMP and, hence, adenylyl cyclase play an intracellular role in the chemotactic response. The behavioral defects of acaA- cells were surprisingly similar to those of cells of null mutants of regA, which encodes the intracellular phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cAMP and, hence, functions opposite adenylyl cyclase A (ACA). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that ACA and RegA are components of a receptor-regulated intracellular circuit that controls protein kinase A activity. In this model, the suppression of lateral pseudopods in the front of a natural wave depends on a complete circuit. Hence, deletion of any component of the circuit (i.e., RegA or ACA) would result in the same chemotactic defect.",

In Dictyostelium, the actin-binding protein Abp1 and myosin IK are enriched in the closing cup and especially at an actin-dense constriction furrow formed around the neck of engulfed budded yeasts. This phagocytic furrow consists of concentric overlapping rings of MyoK, Abp1, Arp3, coronin, and myosin II, following an order strikingly reminiscent of the overall organization of the lamellipodium of migrating cells. Mutation analyses of MyoK revealed that both a C-terminal farnesylation membrane anchor and a Gly-Pro-Arg domain that interacts with profilin and Abp1 were necessary for proper localization in the furrow and efficient phagocytosis. Consequently, we measured the binding affinities of these interactions and unraveled further interactions with profilins, dynamin A, and PakB. Due to the redundancy of the interaction network, we hypothesize that MyoK and Abp1 are restricted to regulatory roles and might affect the dynamic of cup progression. Indeed, phagocytic uptake was regulated antagonistically by MyoK and Abp1. MyoK is phosphorylated by PakB and positively regulates phagocytosis, whereas binding of Abp1 negatively regulates PakB and MyoK. We conclude that a MyoK-Abp1-PakB circuit acts as a switch regulating phagocytosis efficiency of large particles.",

        "abstract": "The Scar/WAVE-complex links upstream Rho-GTPase signaling to the activation of the conserved Arp2/3-complex. Scar/WAVE-induced and Arp2/3-complex-mediated actin nucleation is crucial for actin assembly in protruding lamellipodia to drive cell migration. The heteropentameric Scar/WAVE-complex is composed of Scar/WAVE, Abi, Nap, Pir and a small polypeptide Brk1/HSPC300, and recent work suggested that free Brk1 serves as a homooligomeric precursor in the assembly of this complex. Here we characterized the Brk1 trimer from Dictyostelium by analytical ultracentrifugation and gelfiltration. We show for the first time its dissociation at concentrations in the nanomolar range as well as an exchange of subunits within different DdBrk1 containing complexes. Moreover, we determined the three-dimensional structure of DdBrk1 at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution by X-ray crystallography. Three chains of DdBrk1 are associated with each other forming a parallel triple coiled-coil bundle. Notably, this structure is highly similar to the heterotrimeric \u03b1-helical bundle of HSPC300/WAVE1/Abi2 within the human Scar/WAVE-complex. This finding, together with the fact that Brk1 is collectively sandwiched by the remaining subunits and also constitutes the main subunit connecting the triple-coil domain of the HSPC300/WAVE1/Abi2/ heterotrimer to Sra1(Pir1), implies a critical function of this subunit in the assembly process of the entire Scar/WAVE-complex.",

        "abstract": "Adenylyl cyclase G (ACG) is activated by high osmolality and mediates inhibition of spore germination by this stress factor. The catalytic domains of all eukaryote cyclases are active as dimers and dimerization often mediates activation. To investigate the role of dimerization in ACG activation, we coexpressed ACG with an ACG construct that lacked the catalytic domain (ACGDeltacat) and was driven by a UV-inducible promoter. After UV induction of ACGDeltacat, cAMP production by ACG was strongly inhibited, but osmostimulation was not reduced. Size fractionation of native ACG showed that dimers were formed between ACG molecules and between ACG and ACGDeltacat. However, high osmolality did not alter the dimer/monomer ratio. This indicates that ACG activity requires dimerization via a region outside the catalytic domain but that dimer formation does not mediate activation by high osmolality. To establish whether ACG required auxiliary sensors for osmostimulation, we expressed ACG cDNA in a yeast adenylyl cyclase null mutant. In yeast, cAMP production by ACG was similarly activated by high osmolality as in Dictyostelium. This strongly suggests that the ACG osmosensor is intramolecular, which would define ACG as the first characterized primary osmosensor in eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, chemoattractants induce a fast cGMP response that mediates myosin filament formation in the rear of the cell. The major cGMP signaling pathway consists of a soluble guanylyl cyclase sGC, a cGMP-stimulated cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and the cGMP-target protein GbpC. Here we combine published experiments with many unpublished experiments performed in the past 45 years on the regulation and function of the cGMP signaling pathway. The chemoattractants stimulate heterotrimeric G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 and monomeric Ras proteins. A fraction of the soluble guanylyl cyclase sGC binds with high affinity to a limited number of membrane binding sites, which is essential for sGC to become activated by Ras and G\u03b1 proteins. sGC can also bind to F-actin; binding to branched F-actin in pseudopods enhances basal sGC activity, whereas binding to parallel F-actin in the cortex reduces sGC activity. The cGMP pathway mediates cell polarity by inhibiting the rear: in unstimulated cells by sGC activity in the branched F-actin of pseudopods, in a shallow gradient by stimulated cGMP formation in pseudopods at the leading edge, and during cAMP oscillation to erase the previous polarity and establish a new polarity axis that aligns with the direction of the passing cAMP wave.",

        "abstract": "GbpC is a multidomain Roco protein in Dictyostelium, involved in transduction of intracellular cGMP that is produced by chemotactic signals. We have shown previously that cGMP binding to GbpC induces an intramolecular signaling cascade by activating subsequently the GEF, Ras, and kinase domains. In this study, we report on the cellular localization of GbpC. In resting cells, the protein is present in the cytoplasm, but GbpC rapidly translocates to the cell boundary upon stimulation with the chemoattractant cAMP. Also, during the formation of cell-cell streams and osmotic shock, the protein localizes toward the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. The translocation upon cAMP stimulation occurs downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins but is independent of guanylyl cyclases and the previously identified cGMP-induced intramolecular signaling cascade in GbpC. Mutations in the GRAM domain of GbpC lead to disturbed membrane association and inactivation of GbpC function during chemotaxis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the GRAM domain itself associates with cellular membranes and binds various phospholipids in vitro. Together, the results show that GbpC receives multiple input signals that are both required for functional activity in vivo. cAMP-stimulation induces a cGMP-dependent signaling cascade, leading to activation of kinase activity, and, independently, cAMP induces a GRAM-dependent translocation of GbpC toward the plasma membrane and cell cortex, where it may locally phosphorylate effector proteins, which are needed for proper biological activity.",

Using new analytical tools and statistical methods, we provide, for the first time, a statistically significant quantification of the spatial distribution of the traction forces generated at each phase of the cycle (protrusion, contraction, retraction, and relaxation). We show that cells are constantly under tensional stress and that wild-type cells develop two opposing \"pole\" forces pulling the front and back toward the center whose strength is modulated up and down periodically in each cycle. We demonstrate that nonmuscular myosin II complex (MyoII) cross-linking and motor functions have different roles in controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of traction forces, the changes in cell shape, and the duration of all the phases. We show that the time required to complete each phase is dramatically increased in cells with altered MyoII motor function, demonstrating that it is required not only for contraction but also for protrusion. Concomitant loss of MyoII actin cross-linking leads to a force redistribution throughout the cell perimeter pulling inward toward the center. However, it does not reduce significantly the magnitude of the traction forces, uncovering a non-MyoII-mediated mechanism for the contractility of the cell.",

However, the mechanistic role(s) of Gbetagamma and Ras in PI3K activation remains elusive. Furthermore, the dynamics and function of PI3K activation in the absence of extracellular stimuli have not been fully investigated. We report that gbeta null cells display PI3K and Ras activation, as well as the reciprocal localization of PI3K and PTEN, which lead to local accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P(3). Simultaneous imaging analysis reveals that in the absence of extracellular stimuli, autonomous PI3K and Ras activation occur, concurrently, at the same sites where F-actin projection emerges. The loss of PI3K binding to Ras-guanosine triphosphate abolishes this PI3K activation, whereas prevention of PI3K activity suppresses autonomous Ras activation, suggesting that PI3K and Ras form a positive feedback circuit. This circuit is associated with both random cell migration and cytokinesis and may have initially evolved to control stochastic changes in the cytoskeleton.",

Whereas in metazoans these enzymes control the stability of the HIF\u03b1 family of transcription factor subunits, the Dictyostelium enzyme (DdPhyA) contributes to O(2) regulation of development by a divergent mechanism involving hydroxylation and subsequent glycosylation of DdSkp1, an adaptor subunit in E3(SCF) ubiquitin ligases. Sequences related to DdPhyA, DdSkp1, and the glycosyltransferases that cap Skp1 hydroxyproline occur also in the genomes of Toxoplasma and other protists, suggesting that this O(2) sensing mechanism may be widespread. Here we show by disruption of the TgphyA locus that this enzyme is required for Skp1 glycosylation in Toxoplasma and that disrupted parasites grow slowly at physiological O(2) levels. Conservation of cellular function was tested by expression of TgPhyA in DdphyA-null cells. Simple gene replacement did not rescue Skp1 glycosylation, whereas overexpression not only corrected Skp1 modification but also restored the O(2) requirement to a level comparable to that of overexpressed DdPhyA. Bacterially expressed TgPhyA protein can prolyl hydroxylate both Toxoplasma and Dictyostelium Skp1s. Kinetic analyses showed that TgPhyA has similar properties to DdPhyA, including a superimposable dependence on the concentration of its co-substrate \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Remarkably, however, TgPhyA had a significantly higher apparent affinity for O(2). The findings suggest that Skp1 hydroxylation by PhyA is a conserved process among protists and that this biochemical pathway may indirectly sense O(2) by detecting the levels of O(2)-regulated metabolites such as \u03b1-ketoglutarate.",

However, how the PtdIns lipids are organized spatiotemporally to regulate cellular motility and polarity remains to be clarified. Here, we found that self-organized waves of PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] are generated spontaneously on the membrane of Dictyostelium cells in the absence of a chemoattractant. Characteristic oscillatory dynamics within the PtdIns lipids signaling system were determined experimentally by observing the phenotypic variability of PtdIns lipid waves in single cells, which exhibited characteristics of a relaxation oscillator. The enzymes phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), which are regulators for PtdIns lipid concentrations along the membrane, were essential for wave generation whereas functional actin cytoskeleton was not. Defects in these enzymes inhibited wave generation as well as actin-based polarization and cell migration. On the basis of these experimental results, we developed a reaction-diffusion model that reproduced the characteristic relaxation oscillation dynamics of the PtdIns lipid system, illustrating that a self-organization mechanism provides the basis for the PtdIns lipids signaling system to generate spontaneous spatiotemporal signals for random cell migration and that molecular noise derived from stochastic fluctuations within the signaling components gives rise to the variability of these spontaneous signals.",

This old and contentious issue has been left poorly understood so far. We are able to identify clearly separate friction forces in the tip and in the tail of the slug, traction forces mostly localized in the inner slug/surface contact area in the prespore region and large perpendicular forces directed in the outward direction at the outline of contact area. Surprisingly, the magnitude of friction and traction forces is decreasing with slug velocity indicating that these quantities are probably related to the dynamics of cell/substrate adhesion complexes. Contrary to what is always assumed in models and simulations, friction is not of fluid type (viscous drag) but rather close to solid friction. We suggest that the slime sheath confining laterally the cell mass of the slug experiences a tension that in turn is pulling out the elastic substrate in the direction tangential to the slug profile where sheath is anchored. In addition, we show in the appendix that the iterative method we developed is well adapted to study forces over large and continuous fields when the experimental error is sufficiently low and when the plane of recorded bead deformations is close enough to the elastomer surface, requirements fulfilled in this experimental study of Dictyostelium slugs.",

The membrane localization domain (LD) of Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase 1 (PI3K1) is phosphorylated on serine residues in a GSK3 dependent mechanism and PI3K1-LD exhibited biased membrane localization in gsk3(-) cells compared to the wild type cells. Furthermore, multiple GSK3-phosphorylation consensus sites exist in PI3K1-LD, of which phosphomimetic substitutions restored cAMP induced transient membrane localization of PI3K1-LD in gsk3(-) cells. Serine to alanine substitution mutants of PI3K1-LD, in contrast, displayed constitutive membrane localization in wild type cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that GSK3 dependent serine phosphorylation of PI3K1-LD is constitutive during the course of cAMP stimulation.

Risk of bipolar disorder is heavily influenced by genetic predisposition, but is a complex genetic trait and, to date, genetic studies have provided little insight into its molecular origins. An alternative approach is to investigate the genetics of Li(+) sensitivity. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium, we previously identified prolyl oligopeptidase (PO) as a modulator of Li(+) sensitivity. In a link to the clinic, PO enzyme activity is altered in bipolar disorder patients. Further studies demonstrated that PO is a negative regulator of inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate (IP(3)) synthesis, a Li(+) sensitive intracellular signal. However, it was unclear how PO could influence either Li(+) sensitivity or risk of bipolar disorder. Here we show that in both Dictyostelium and cultured human cells PO acts via Multiple Inositol Polyphosphate Phosphatase (Mipp1) to control gene expression. This reveals a novel, gene regulatory network that modulates inositol metabolism and Li(+) sensitivity. Among its targets is the inositol monophosphatase gene IMPA2, which has also been associated with risk of bipolar disorder in some family studies, and our observations offer a cellular signalling pathway in which PO activity and IMPA2 gene expression converge.",

        "abstract": "Increased intracellular pH is an evolutionarily conserved signal necessary for directed cell migration. We reported previously that in Dictyostelium cells lacking H(+) efflux by a Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE; Ddnhe1(-)), chemotaxis is impaired and the assembly of filamentous actin (F-actin) is attenuated. We now describe a modifier screen that reveals the C-terminal fragment of actin-interacting protein 1 (Aip1) enhances the chemotaxis defect of Ddnhe1(-) cells but has no effect in wild-type Ax2 cells. However, expression of full-length Aip1 mostly suppresses chemotaxis defects of Ddnhe1(-) cells and restores F-actin assembly. Aip1 functions to promote cofilin-dependent actin remodeling, and we found that although full-length Aip1 binds cofilin and F-actin, the C-terminal fragment binds cofilin but not F-actin. Because pH-dependent cofilin activity is attenuated in mammalian cells lacking H(+) efflux by NHE1, our current data suggest that full-length Aip1 facilitates F-actin assembly when cofilin activity is limited. We predict the C-terminus of Aip1 enhances defective chemotaxis of Ddnhe1(-) cells by sequestering the limited amount of active cofilin without promoting F-actin assembly. Our findings indicate a cooperative role of Aip1 and cofilin in pH-dependent cell migration, and they suggest defective chemotaxis in Ddnhe1(-) cells is determined primarily by loss of cofilin-dependent actin dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles, including microvesicles and exosomes, are lipidic membrane-derived vesicles that are secreted by most cell types. Exosomes, one class of these vesicles that are 30-100 nm in diameter, hold a great deal of promise in disease diagnostics, as they display the same protein biomarkers as their originating cell. For exosomes to become useful in disease diagnostics, and as burgeoning drug delivery platforms, they must be isolated efficiently and effectively without compromising their structure. Most current exosome isolation methods have practical problems including being too time-consuming and labor intensive, destructive to the exosomes, or too costly for use in clinical settings. To this end, this study examines the use of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers in a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) protocol to isolate exosomes from diverse matrices of practical concern. Initial results demonstrate the ability to isolate extracellular vesicles enriched in exosomes with comparable yields and size distributions on a much faster time scale when compared to traditional isolation methods. As a demonstration of the potential analytical utility of the approach, extracellular vesicle recoveries from cell culture milieu and a mock urine matrix are presented. The potential for scalable separations covering submilliliter spin-down columns to the preparative scale is anticipated.",

During wave propagation, the inner territory increases at the expense of the external area. Beyond a size limit, the inner territory becomes unstable, breaking into an inner and an external domain.

To explore potential regulatory mechanisms of GPCR-controlled Ras signaling in chemosensing, we applied a software package, Simmune, to construct detailed spatiotemporal models simulating responses of the cAR1-mediated Ras signaling network. We first determined the dynamics of G-protein activation and Ras signaling in Dictyostelium cells in response to cAMP stimulations using live-cell imaging and then constructed computation models by incorporating potential mechanisms. Using simulations, we validated the dynamics of signaling events and predicted the dynamic profiles of those events in the cAR1-mediated Ras signaling networks with defective Ras inhibitory mechanisms, such as without RasGAP, with RasGAP overexpression, or with RasGAP hyperactivation. We describe a method of using Simmune to construct spatiotemporal models of a signaling network and run computational simulations without writing mathematical equations.

In this study, we have examined the role of PCH family proteins, Nwk/Bzz1p-like protein (NLP) and Syndapin-like protein (SLP), in the regulation of the formation and trafficking of WASP-vesicles during chemotaxis. NLP and SLP appear to be functionally redundant and deletion of both nlp and slp genes causes the loss of polarized F-actin organization and significant defects in chemotaxis. WASP and NLP are colocalized on vesicles and interactions between two molecules via the SH3 domain of NLP/SLP and the proline-rich repeats of WASP are required for vesicle formation from Golgi. Microtubules are required for polarized trafficking of these vesicles as vesicles showing high directed mobility are absent in cells treated with nocodazole. Our results suggest that interaction of WASP with NLP/SLP is required for the formation and trafficking of vesicles from Golgi to the membrane, which might play a central role in the establishment of cell polarity during chemotaxis.",

Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding a plasma membrane-type Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) of T.gondii (TgA1). The predicted protein (TgA1) exhibits 32-36% identity to vacuolar Ca(2+)-ATPases of Trypanosoma cruzi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum. Sequencing of both cDNA and genomic DNA from T.gondii indicated that TgA1 contains two introns near the C-terminus. A hydropathy profile of the protein suggests 10 transmembrane domains. TgA1 suppresses the Ca(2+) hypersensitivity of a mutant of S.cerevisiae that has a defect in vacuolar Ca(2+) accumulation. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy analysis indicate that TgA1 localizes to the plasma membrane and co-localizes with the vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase to intracellular vacuoles identified morphologically and by X-ray microanalysis as the acidocalcisomes. This vacuolar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase could play an important role in Ca(2+) homeostasis in T.gondii.",

Unlike mammalian cells, Dictyostelium cells do not make integrin mediated focal adhesions. Nevertheless, they can move rapidly on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. We have found that adhesion to such surfaces can be inhibited by addition of sugars or amino acids to the buffer. Treating whole cells with \u03b1lpha-mannosidase to cleave surface oligosaccharides also reduces adhesion. The results indicate that adhesion of these cells is mediated by van der Waals attraction of their surface glycoproteins to the underlying substratum. Since glycoproteins are prevalent components of the surface of most cells, innate adhesion may be a common cellular property that has been overlooked.",

        "abstract": "Signal transduction and cytoskeleton networks in a wide variety of cells display excitability, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that during random migration and in response to chemoattractants, cells maintain complementary spatial and temporal distributions of Ras activity and phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>]. In addition, depletion of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> by disruption of the 5-phosphatase, Dd5P4, or by recruitment of 4-phosphatase INPP4B to the plasma membrane, leads to elevated Ras activity, cell spreading, and altered migratory behavior. Furthermore, RasGAP2 and RapGAP3 bind to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, and the phenotypes of cells lacking these genes mimic those with low PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> levels, providing a molecular mechanism. These findings suggest that Ras activity drives PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> down, causing the PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>-binding GAPs to dissociate from the membrane, further activating Ras, completing a positive-feedback loop essential for excitability. Consistently, a computational model incorporating such a feedback loop in an excitable network model accurately simulates the dynamic distributions of active Ras and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> as well as cell migratory behavior. The mutually inhibitory Ras-PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> mechanisms we uncovered here provide a framework for Ras regulation that may play a key role in many physiological processes.",

        "abstract": "Dictyostelium cells form a multicellular organism through the aggregation of independent cells. This process requires both chemotaxis and signal relay in which the chemoattractant cAMP activates adenylyl cyclase through the G protein-coupled cAMP receptor cAR1. cAMP is produced and secreted and it activates receptors on neighboring cells, thereby relaying the chemoattractant signal to distant cells. Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, we have identified a TOR-containing complex in Dictyostelium that is related to the TORC2 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and regulates both chemotaxis and signal relay. We demonstrate that mutations in Dictyostelium LST8, RIP3, and Pia, orthologues of the yeast TORC2 components LST8, AVO1, and AVO3, exhibit a common set of phenotypes including reduced cell polarity, chemotaxis speed and directionality, phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and the related PKBR1, and activation of adenylyl cyclase. Further, we provide evidence for a role of Ras in the regulation of TORC2. We propose that, through the regulation of chemotaxis and signal relay, TORC2 plays an essential role in controlling aggregation by coordinating the two essential arms of the developmental pathway that leads to multicellularity in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the myosin II motor domain (S1) preferentially binds to specific subsets of actin filaments in vivo, we expressed GFP-fused S1 with mutations that enhanced its affinity for actin in Dictyostelium cells. Consistent with the hypothesis, the GFP-S1 mutants were localized along specific portions of the cell cortex. Comparison with rhodamine-phalloidin staining in fixed cells demonstrated that the GFP-S1 probes preferentially bound to actin filaments in the rear cortex and cleavage furrows, where actin filaments are stretched by interaction with endogenous myosin II filaments. The GFP-S1 probes were similarly enriched in the cortex stretched passively by traction forces in the absence of myosin II or by external forces using a microcapillary. The preferential binding of GFP-S1 mutants to stretched actin filaments did not depend on cortexillin I or PTEN, two proteins previously implicated in the recruitment of myosin II filaments to stretched cortex. These results suggested that it is the stretching of the actin filaments itself that increases their affinity for the myosin II motor domain. In contrast, the GFP-fused myosin I motor domain did not localize to stretched actin filaments, which suggests different preferences of the motor domains for different structures of actin filaments play a role in distinct intracellular localizations of myosin I and II. We propose a scheme in which the stretching of actin filaments, the preferential binding of myosin II filaments to stretched actin filaments, and myosin II-dependent contraction form a positive feedback loop that contributes to the stabilization of cell polarity and to the responsiveness of the cells to external mechanical stimuli.",

Although much is known about chemoattraction, chemorepulsion remains poorly understood. Proliferating <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells secrete a chemorepellent protein called AprA. AprA prevents pseudopod formation at the region of the cell closest to the source of AprA, causing the random movement of cells to be biased away from the AprA. Activation of Ras proteins in a localized sector of a cell cortex helps to induce pseudopod formation, and Ras proteins are needed for AprA chemorepulsion. Here we show that AprA locally inhibits Ras cortical activation through the G protein-coupled receptor GrlH, the G protein subunits G\u03b2 and G\u03b18, Ras protein RasG, protein kinase B, the p21-activated kinase PakD, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase Erk1. Diffusion calculations and experiments indicate that in a colony of cells, high extracellular concentrations of AprA in the center can globally inhibit Ras activation, while a gradient of AprA that naturally forms at the edge of the colony allows cells to activate Ras at sectors of the cell other than the sector of the cell closest to the center of the colony, effectively inducing both repulsion from the colony and cell differentiation. Together, these results suggest that a pathway that inhibits local Ras activation can mediate chemorepulsion.",

Myosin II assembly is regulated by myosin heavy chain kinase-mediated phosphorylation of its tail. Kinase activity depends on the activation state of the p21-activated kinase a. The myosin II defect of corA(-) mutant is alleviated by dominant-negative p21-activated kinase a. It is rescued by wild-type coronin, whereas coronin carrying a mutated Cdc42- and Rac-interactive binding motif failed to rescue the myosin defect in corA(-) mutant cells. Ectopically expressed myosin heavy chain kinases affinity purified from corA(-) cells show reduced kinase activity.

        "abstract": "Although the distinct distribution of certain molecules along the anterior or posterior edge is essential for directed cell migration, the mechanisms to maintain asymmetric protein localization have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we studied a mechanism for the distinct localizations of two Dictyostelium talin homologues, talin A and talin B, both of which play important roles in cell migration and adhesion. Using GFP fusion, we found that talin B, as well as its C-terminal actin-binding region, which consists of an I/LWEQ domain and a villin headpiece domain, was restricted to the leading edge of migrating cells. This is in sharp contrast to talin A and its C-terminal actin-binding domain, which co-localized with myosin II along the cell posterior cortex, as reported previously. Intriguingly, even in myosin II-null cells, talin A and its actin-binding domain displayed a specific distribution, co-localizing with stretched actin filaments. In contrast, talin B was excluded from regions rich in stretched actin filaments, although a certain amount of its actin-binding region alone was present in those areas. When cells were sucked by a micro-pipette, talin B was not detected in the retracting aspirated lobe where acto-myosin, talin A, and the actin-binding regions of talin A and talin B accumulated. Based on these results, we suggest that talin A predominantly interacts with actin filaments stretched by myosin II through its C-terminal actin-binding region, while the actin-binding region of talin B does not make such distinctions. Furthermore, talin B appears to have an additional, unidentified mechanism that excludes it from the region rich in stretched actin filaments. We propose that these actin-binding properties play important roles in the anterior and posterior enrichment of talin B and talin A, respectively, during directed cell migration.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy (the process of self-digestion by a cell through the action of enzymes originating within the lysosome of the same cell) is a catabolic process that is generally used by the cell as a mechanism for quality control and survival under nutrient stress conditions. As autophagy is often induced under conditions of stress that could also lead to cell death, there has been a propagation of the idea that autophagy can act as a cell death mechanism. Although there is growing evidence of cell death by autophagy, this type of cell death, often called autophagic cell death, remains poorly defined and somewhat controversial. Merely the presence of autophagic markers in a cell undergoing death does not necessarily equate to autophagic cell death. Nevertheless, studies involving genetic manipulation of autophagy in physiological settings provide evidence for a direct role of autophagy in specific scenarios. This article endeavours to summarise these physiological studies where autophagy has a clear role in mediating the death process and discusses the potential significance of cell death by autophagy.",

Several class I myosins preferentially bind to acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], through a tail homology 1 (TH1) domain. Here, we show that the second messenger lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) binds to the TH1 domain of a subset of Dictyostelium class I myosins (ID, IE, and IF) and recruits them to the plasma membrane. The PIP3-regulated membrane recruitment of myosin I promoted chemotaxis and induced chemoattractant-stimulated actin polymerization. Similarly, PIP3 recruited human myosin IF to the plasma membrane upon chemotactic stimulation in a neutrophil cell line. These data suggest a mechanism through which the PIP3 signal is transmitted through myosin I to the actin cytoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Cells have an internal compass that enables them to move along shallow chemical gradients. As amoeboid cells migrate, signaling events such as Ras and PI3K activation occur spontaneously on pseudopodia. Uniform stimuli trigger a symmetric response, whereupon cells stop and round up; then localized patches of activity appear as cells spread. Finally cells adapt and resume random migration. In contrast, chemotactic gradients continuously direct signaling events to the front of the cell. Local-excitation, global-inhibition (LEGI) and reaction-diffusion models have captured some of these features of chemotaxing cells, but no system has explained the complex response kinetics, sensitivity to shallow gradients, or the role of recently observed propagating waves within the actin cytoskeleton. We report here that Ras and PI3K activation move in phase with the cytoskeleton events and, drawing on all of these observations, propose the LEGI-biased excitable network hypothesis. We formulate a model that simulates most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells: In the absence of stimulation, there are spontaneous spots of activity. Stimulus increments trigger an initial burst of patches followed by localized secondary events. After a few minutes, the system adapts, again displaying random activity. In gradients, the activity patches are directed continuously and selectively toward the chemoattractant, providing an extraordinary degree of amplification. Importantly, by perturbing model parameters, we generate distinct behaviors consistent with known classes of mutants. Our study brings together heretofore diverse observations on spontaneous cytoskeletal activity, signaling responses to temporal stimuli, and spatial gradient sensing into a unified scheme.",

        "abstract": "O-GlcNAcylation is a prominent modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in animals and plants and is mediated by a single O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Spindly (Spy), a paralog of OGT first discovered in higher plants, has an ortholog in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, and both enzymes are now recognized as O-fucosyltransferases (OFTs). Here we investigate the evolution of spy-like genes and experimentally confirm OFT activity in the social amoeba Dictyostelium-a protist that is more related to fungi and metazoa. Immunofluorescence probing with the fucose-specific Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) and biochemical cell fractionation combined with western blotting suggested the occurrence of nucleocytoplasmic fucosylation. The absence of reactivity in mutants deleted in spy or gmd (unable to synthesize GDP-Fuc) suggested monofucosylation mediated by Spy. Genetic ablation of the modE locus, previously predicted to encode a GDP-fucose transporter, confirmed its necessity for fucosylation in the secretory pathway but not for the nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Affinity capture of these proteins combined with mass spectrometry confirmed monofucosylation of Ser and Thr residues of several known nucleocytoplasmic proteins. As in Toxoplasma, the Spy OFT was required for optimal proliferation of Dictyostelium under laboratory conditions. These findings support a new phylogenetic analysis of OGT and OFT evolution that indicates their occurrence in the last eukaryotic common ancestor but mostly complementary presence in its eukaryotic descendants with the notable exception that both occur in red algae and plants. Their generally exclusive expression, high degree of conservation, and shared monoglycosylation targets suggest overlapping roles in physiological regulation.",

In contrast to early models, our data indicate a continuum of transcriptional states, with a slowly fluctuating initiation rate converting the gene between different levels of activity, interspersed with extended periods of inactivity. We place an upper limit of 40 s on the lifetime of fluctuations in elongation rate, with initiation rate variations persisting an order of magnitude longer.

DdCAD-1 is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a soluble protein and then transported by contractile vacuoles to the plasma membrane for surface presentation or secretion. DdCAD-1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was expressed in cadA-null cells for further investigation of this unconventional protein transport pathway. Both morphological and biochemical characterizations showed that DdCAD-1-GFP was imported into contractile vacuoles. Time-lapse microscopy of transfectants revealed the transient appearance of DdCAD-1-GFP-filled vesicular structures in the lumen of contractile vacuoles, suggesting that DdCAD-1 could be imported by invagination of contractile vacuole membrane. To assess the structural requirements in this transport process, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of DdCAD-1 were expressed separately in cells as GFP fusion proteins. Both fusion proteins failed to enter the contractile vacuole, suggesting that the integrity of DdCAD-1 is required for import. Such a requirement was also observed in in vitro reconstitution assays using His(6)-tagged fusion proteins and purified contractile vacuoles. Import of DdCAD-1 was compromised when two of its three Ca(2+)-binding sites were mutated, indicating a role for Ca(2+) in the import process. Spectral analysis showed that mutations in the Ca(2+)-binding sites resulted in subtle conformational changes. Indeed, proteins with altered conformation failed to enter the contractile vacuole, suggesting that the import signal is somehow integrated in the three-dimensional structure of DdCAD-1.",

        "abstract": "Global stimulation of Dictyostelium with different chemoattractants elicits multiple transient signaling responses, including synthesis of cAMP and cGMP, actin polymerization, activation of kinases ERK2, TORC2, and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, and Ras-GTP accumulation. Mechanisms that down-regulate these responses are poorly understood. Here we examine transient activation of TORC2 in response to chemically distinct chemoattractants, cAMP and folate, and suggest that TORC2 is regulated by adaptive, desensitizing responses to stimulatory ligands that are independent of downstream, feedback, or feedforward circuits. Cells with acquired insensitivity to either folate or cAMP remain fully responsive to TORC2 activation if stimulated with the other ligand. Thus TORC2 responses to cAMP or folate are not cross-inhibitory. Using a series of signaling mutants, we show that folate and cAMP activate TORC2 through an identical GEF/Ras pathway but separate receptors and G protein couplings. Because the common GEF/Ras pathway also remains fully responsive to one chemoattractant after desensitization to the other, GEF/Ras must act downstream and independent of adaptation to persistent ligand stimulation. When initial chemoattractant concentrations are immediately diluted, cells rapidly regain full responsiveness. We suggest that ligand adaptation functions in upstream inhibitory pathways that involve chemoattractant-specific receptor/G protein complexes and regulate multiple response pathways.",

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly sensitive cellular energy sensor that is stimulated by ATP-depleting stresses. By antisense-inhibiting chaperonin 60 expression, we produced mitochondrially diseased strains with gene dose-dependent defects in phototaxis, growth, and multicellular morphogenesis. Mitochondrial disease was phenocopied in a gene dose-dependent manner by overexpressing a constitutively active AMPK alpha subunit (AMPKalphaT). The aberrant phenotypes in mitochondrially diseased strains were suppressed completely by antisense-inhibiting AMPKalpha expression. Phagocytosis and macropinocytosis, although energy consuming, were unaffected by mitochondrial disease and AMPKalpha expression levels. Consistent with the role of AMPK in energy homeostasis, mitochondrial \"mass\" and ATP levels were reduced by AMPKalpha antisense inhibition and increased by AMPKalphaT overexpression, but they were near normal in mitochondrially diseased cells. We also found that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside, a pharmacological AMPK activator in mammalian cells, mimics mitochondrial disease in impairing Dictyostelium phototaxis and that AMPKalpha antisense-inhibited cells were resistant to this effect.

Research into chemotaxis has benefitted greatly from a systems biology approach that combines novel experimental and computational tools to pose and test hypotheses. Recently, one such hypothesis has been postulated proposing that chemotaxis in eukaryotic cells is mediated by locally biasing the activity of an underlying excitable system. The excitable system hypothesis can account for a number of cellular behaviors related to chemotaxis, including the stochastic nature of the movement of unstimulated cells, the directional bias imposed by chemoattractant gradients, and the observed spatial and temporal distribution of signaling and cytoskeleton proteins.",

        "abstract": "P2X receptors (P2XRs) are ATP-activated calcium-permeable ligand-gated ion channels traditionally viewed as sensors of extracellular ATP during diverse physiological processes including pain, inflammation, and taste. However, in addition to a cell surface residency P2XRs also populate the membranes of intracellular compartments, including mammalian lysosomes, phagosomes, and the contractile vacuole (CV) of the amoeba Dictyostelium. The function of intracellular P2XRs is unclear and represents a major gap in our understanding of ATP signaling. Here, we exploit the genetic versatility of Dictyostelium to investigate the effects of physiological concentrations of ATP on calcium signaling in isolated CVs. Within the CV, an acidic calcium store, P2XRs are orientated to sense luminal ATP. Application of ATP to isolated vacuoles leads to luminal translocation of ATP and release of calcium. Mechanisms of luminal ATP translocation and ATP-evoked calcium release share common pharmacology, suggesting that they are linked processes. The ability of ATP to mobilize stored calcium is reduced in vacuoles isolated from P2X(A)R knock-out amoeba and ablated in cells devoid of P2XRs. Pharmacological inhibition of luminal ATP translocation or depletion of CV calcium attenuates CV function in vivo, manifesting as a loss of regulatory cell volume decrease following osmotic swelling. We propose that intracellular P2XRs regulate vacuole activity by acting as calcium release channels, activated by translocation of ATP into the vacuole lumen.",

        "abstract": "The Scar/WAVE complex is the principal catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipod formation. Here we show that Scar/WAVE's proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Blocking Scar/WAVE activation stops phosphorylation in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells, implying that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed, rather than controlling whether they are initiated. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signaling but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion and diminished when cells deadhere. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of knockout cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation and actin regulation. However, pseudopods and patches of phosphorylation-deficient Scar/WAVE last substantially longer in mutants, altering the dynamics and size of pseudopods and lamellipods and thus changing migration speed. Scar/WAVE phosphorylation does not require ERK2 in Dictyostelium or mammalian cells. However, the MAPKKK homologue SepA contributes substantially-sepA mutants have less steady-state phosphorylation, which does not increase in response to adhesion. The mutants also behave similarly to cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient Scar, with longer-lived pseudopods and patches of Scar recruitment. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVE's activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.",

        "abstract": "The centromeric histone H3 variant (CenH3) serves to target the kinetochore to the centromeres and thus ensures correct chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. The Dictyostelium H3-like variant H3v1 was identified as the CenH3 ortholog. Dictyostelium CenH3 has an extended N-terminal domain with no similarity to any other known proteins and a histone fold domain at its C-terminus. Within the histone fold, \u03b1-helix 2 (\u03b12) and an extended loop 1 (L1) have been shown to be required for targeting CenH3 to centromeres. Compared to other known and putative CenH3 histones, Dictyostelium CenH3 has a shorter L1, suggesting that the extension is not an obligatory feature. Through ChIP analysis and fluorescence microscopy of live and fixed cells, we provide here the first survey of centromere structure in amoebozoa. The six telocentric centromeres were found to mostly consist of all the DIRS-1 elements and to associate with H3K9me3. During interphase, the centromeres remain attached to the centrosome forming a single CenH3-containing cluster. Loading of Dictyostelium CenH3 onto centromeres occurs at the G2/prophase transition, in contrast to the anaphase/telophase loading of CenH3 observed in metazoans. This suggests that loading during G2/prophase is the ancestral eukaryotic mechanism and that anaphase/telophase loading of CenH3 has evolved more recently after the amoebozoa diverged from the animal linage.",

        "abstract": "Allorecognition and tissue formation are interconnected processes that require signaling between matching pairs of the polymorphic transmembrane proteins TgrB1 and TgrC1 in Dictyostelium. Extracellular and intracellular cAMP signaling are essential to many developmental processes. The three adenylate cyclase genes, acaA, acrA and acgA are required for aggregation, culmination and spore dormancy, respectively, and some of their functions can be suppressed by activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA. Previous studies have suggested that cAMP signaling might be dispensable for allorecognition and tissue formation, while others have argued that it is essential throughout development. Here, we show that allorecognition and tissue formation do not require cAMP production as long as PKA is active. We eliminated cAMP production by deleting the three adenylate cyclases and overexpressed PKA-C to enable aggregation. The cells exhibited cell polarization, tissue formation and cooperation with allotype-compatible wild-type cells, but not with incompatible cells. Therefore, TgrB1-TgrC1 signaling controls allorecognition and tissue formation, while cAMP is dispensable as long as PKA-C is overexpressed.",

        "abstract": "Cytokinesis D is known as the midwife mechanism in which neighboring cells facilitate cell division by crossing the cleavage furrow of dividing cells. Cytokinesis D is thought to be mediated by chemotaxis, where midwife cells migrate toward dividing cells by sensing an unknown chemoattractant secreted from the cleavage furrow. In this study, to validate this chemotaxis model, we aspirated the fluid from the vicinity of the cleavage furrow of a dividing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cell and discharged it onto a neighboring cell using a microcapillary. However, the neighboring cells did not show any chemotaxis toward the fluid. In addition, the cells did not manifest an increase in the levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cAMP, or cGMP, which are expected to rise in chemotaxing cells. From several lines of our experiments, including these findings, we concluded that chemotaxis does not contribute to cytokinesis D. As an alternative, we propose a cortical-flow model, where a migrating cell attaches to a dividing cell by chance and is guided toward the furrow by the cortical flow on the dividing cell, and then physically assists the separation of the daughter cells.",

        "abstract": "Cells migrate by extending pseudopods such as lamellipodia and blebs. Although the signals leading to lamellipodia extension have been extensively investigated, those for bleb extension remain unclear. Here, we investigated signals for blebbing in Dictyostelium cells using a newly developed assay to induce blebbing. When cells were cut into two pieces with a microneedle, the anucleate fragments vigorously extended blebs. This assay enabled us to induce blebbing reproducibly, and analyses of knockout mutants and specific inhibitors identified candidate molecules that regulate blebbing. Blebs were also induced in anucleate fragments of leukocytes, indicating that this assay is generally applicable to animal cells. After cutting, microtubules in the anucleate fragments promptly depolymerized, followed by the extension of blebs. Furthermore, when intact cells were treated with a microtubule inhibitor, they frequently extended blebs. The depolymerization of microtubules induced the delocalization of inositol lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate from the cell membrane. PI3 kinase-null cells frequently extended blebs, whereas PTEN-null cells extended fewer blebs. From these observations, we propose a model in which microtubules play a critical role in bleb regulation via inositol lipid metabolism.",

We identify potential cellular effectors for the two kinases by analyzing the corresponding null mutants. There are proteins and mRNAs that are altered in abundance in only one or the other of the two mutants, indicating that each kinase has some unique functions. However, proteomic and microarray analyses identified a number of proteins and genes, respectively, that are similarly misregulated in both mutant strains. The positive correlation between the array data and the proteomic data is consistent with the Zak1-GskA signaling pathway's functioning by directly or indirectly regulating gene expression. The discoidin 1 genes are positively regulated by the pathway, while the abundance of the H5 protein is negatively regulated. Two of the targets, H5 and discoidin 1, are well-characterized markers for early development, indicating that the Zak1-GskA pathway plays a role in development earlier than previously observed.",

Why dynactin interacts separately with the dynein motor and also with microtubules is hotly debated. Here we disrupted these interactions in a targeted manner on phagosomes extracted from cells, followed by optical trapping to interrogate native dynein-dynactin teams on single phagosomes. Perturbing the dynactin-dynein interaction reduced dynein's on rate to microtubules. In contrast, perturbing the dynactin-microtubule interaction increased dynein's off rate markedly when dynein was generating force against the optical trap. The dynactin-microtubule link is therefore required for persistence against load, a finding of importance because disease-relevant mutations in dynein-dynactin are known to interfere with \"high-load\" functions of dynein in cells. Our findings call attention to a less studied property of dynein-dynactin, namely, its detachment against load, in understanding dynein dysfunction.",

Actin-binding substantially reduces the affinity of ATP for myosin, but the effect of actin on myosin's ADP affinity is quite variable among myosin isoforms, serving as the principal mechanism for tuning the actomyosin system to specific physiological purposes. To understand the structural basis of this variable relationship between actin and ADP binding, we studied several constructs of the catalytic domain of Dictyostelium myosin II, varying their length (from the N-terminal origin) and cysteine content. The constructs varied considerably in their actin-activated ATPase activity and in the effect of actin on ADP affinity. Actin had no significant effect on ADP affinity for a single-cysteine catalytic domain construct, a double-cysteine construct partially restored the actin-dependence of ADP binding, and restoration of all native Cys restored it further, but full restoration of function (similar to that of skeletal muscle myosin II) was obtained only by adding all native Cys and an artificial lever arm extension. Pyrene-actin fluorescence confirmed these effects on ADP binding to actomyosin. We conclude that myosin's Cys content and lever arm both allosterically modulate the reciprocal affinities of myosin for ADP and actin, a key determinant of the biological functions of myosin isoforms.",

        "abstract": "Macropinocytosis plays an important role in the internalization of antigens by dendritic cells and is the route of entry for many bacterial pathogens; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation or maturation of macropinosomes. Like dendritic cells, Dictyostelium amoebae are active in macropinocytosis, and various proteins have been identified that contribute to this process. As described here, microscopic analysis of null mutants have revealed that the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases, PIK1 and PIK2, and the downstream effector protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) are important in regulating completion of macropinocytosis. Although actin-rich membrane protrusions form in these cell lines, they recede without forming macropinosomes. Imaging of cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the pleckstrin homology domain (PH) of PKB (GFP-PHPKB) indicates that D3 phosphoinositides are enriched in the forming macropinocytic cup and remain associated with newly formed macropinosomes for <1 minute. A fusion protein, consisting of GFP fused to an F-actin binding domain, overlaps with GFP-PHPKB in the timing of association with forming macropinosomes. Although macropinocytosis is reduced in cells expressing dominant negative Rab7, microscopic imaging studies reveal that GFP-Rab7 associates only with formed macropinosomes at approximately the time that F-actin and D3 phosphoinositide levels decrease. These results support a model in which F-actin modulating proteins and vesicle trafficking proteins coordinately regulate the formation and maturation of macropinosomes.",

TgrB1 and TgrC1 are necessary and sufficient for allorecognition, and they carry out separate albeit overlapping functions in development, but their mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we show that TgrB1 acts as a receptor with TgrC1 as its ligand in cooperative aggregation and differentiation. The proteins bind each other in a sequence-specific manner; TgrB1 exhibits a cell-autonomous function and TgrC1 acts non-cell-autonomously. The TgrB1 cytoplasmic tail is essential for its function and it becomes phosphorylated upon association with TgrC1. Dominant mutations in TgrB1 activate the receptor function and confer partial ligand independence. These roles in development and sociality suggest that allorecognition is crucial in the integration of individual cells into a coherent organism.",

        "abstract": "Mammalian embryogenesis is a dynamic process involving gene expression and mechanical forces between proliferating cells. The exact nature of these interactions, which determine the lineage patterning of the trophectoderm and endoderm tissues occurring in a highly regulated manner at precise periods during the embryonic development, is an area of debate. We have developed a computational modeling framework for studying this process, by which the combined effects of mechanical and genetic interactions are analyzed within the context of proliferating cells. At a purely mechanical level, we demonstrate that the perpendicular alignment of the animal-vegetal (a-v) and embryonic-abembryonic (eb-ab) axes is a result of minimizing the total elastic conformational energy of the entire collection of cells, which are constrained by the zona pellucida. The coupling of gene expression with the mechanics of cell movement is important for formation of both the trophectoderm and the endoderm. In studying the formation of the trophectoderm, we contrast and compare quantitatively two hypotheses: (1) The position determines gene expression, and (2) the gene expression determines the position. Our model, which couples gene expression with mechanics, suggests that differential adhesion between different cell types is a critical determinant in the robust endoderm formation. In addition to differential adhesion, two different testable hypotheses emerge when considering endoderm formation: (1) A directional force acts on certain cells and moves them into forming the endoderm layer, which separates the blastocoel and the cells of the inner cell mass (ICM). In this case the blastocoel simply acts as a static boundary. (2) The blastocoel dynamically applies pressure upon the cells in contact with it, such that cell segregation in the presence of differential adhesion leads to the endoderm formation. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine cell-based spatial mechanical simulations with genetic networks to explain mammalian embryogenesis. Such a framework provides the means to test hypotheses in a controlled in silico environment.",

        "abstract": "The dynein motor domain is composed of a tail, head, and stalk and is thought to generate a force to microtubules by swinging the tail against the head during its ATPase cycle. For this \"power stroke,\" dynein has to coordinate the tail swing with microtubule association/dissociation at the tip of the stalk. Although a detailed picture of the former process is emerging, the latter process remains to be elucidated. By using the single-headed recombinant motor domain of Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein, we address the questions of how the interaction of the motor domain with a microtubule is modulated by ATPase steps, how the two mechanical cycles (the microtubule association/dissociation and tail swing) are coordinated, and which ATPase site among the multiple sites in the motor domain regulates the coordination. Based on steady-state and pre-steady-state measurements, we demonstrate that the two mechanical cycles proceed synchronously at most of the intermediate states in the ATPase cycle: the motor domain in the poststroke state binds strongly to the microtubule with a K(d) of approximately 0.2 microM, whereas most of the motor domains in the prestroke state bind weakly to the microtubule with a K(d) of >10 microM. However, our results suggest that the timings of the microtubule affinity change and tail swing are staggered at the recovery stroke step in which the tail swings from the poststroke to the prestroke position. The ATPase site in the AAA1 module of the motor domain was found to be responsible for the coordination of these two mechanical processes.",

Here we show that a locus ('Tgr') of a social amoeba represents a polychromatic greenbeard. Patterns of natural Tgr locus sequence polymorphisms predict partner-specific patterns of cooperation by underlying variation in partner-specific protein-protein binding strength and recognition specificity. Finally, Tgr locus polymorphisms increase fitness because they help avoid potential costs of cooperating with incompatible partners. These results suggest that a polychromatic greenbeard can provide a key mechanism for the evolutionary maintenance of cooperation.",

Unusually, activation is regulated by serine phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of a tyrosine phosphatase: PTP3. The identity of the cognate tyrosine kinase is unknown, and we show that two tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) enzymes, Pyk2 and Pyk3, share this function; thus, for stress-induced STATc activation, single null mutants are only marginally impaired, but the double mutant is nonactivatable. When cells are stressed, Pyk2 and Pyk3 undergo increased autocatalytic tyrosine phosphorylation. The site(s) that are generated bind the SH2 domain of STATc, and then STATc becomes the target of further kinase action. The signaling pathways that activate Pyk2 and Pyk3 are only partially overlapping, and there may be a structural basis for this difference because Pyk3 contains both a TKL domain and a pseudokinase domain. The latter functions, like the JH2 domain of metazoan JAKs, as a negative regulator of the kinase domain. The fact that two differently regulated kinases catalyze the same phosphorylation event may facilitate specific targeting because under stress, Pyk3 and Pyk2 accumulate in different parts of the cell; Pyk3 moves from the cytosol to the cortex, whereas Pyk2 accumulates in cytosolic granules that colocalize with PTP3.",

Here, we show that the type V myosin myoJ localizes to CV membranes and is required for efficient osmoregulation, the normal accumulation of CV membranes in the cortex, and the conversion of collapsed bladder membranes into outwardly radiating cortical CV tubules. Complementation of myoJ-null cells with a version of myoJ containing a shorter lever arm causes these radiating tubules to move at a slower speed, confirming myoJ's role in translocating CV membranes along the cortex. MyoJ-null cells also exhibit a dramatic concentration of CV membranes around the microtubule-organizing center. Consistently, we demonstrate that CV membranes also move bi-directionally on microtubules between the cortex and the centrosome. Therefore, myoJ cooperates with plus and minus end-directed microtubule motors to drive the normal distribution and dynamics of the CV complex in Dictyostelium.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel three-dimensional (3D) traction force microscopy (TFM) method motivated by the recent discovery that cells adhering on plane surfaces exert both in-plane and out-of-plane traction stresses. We measure the 3D deformation of the substratum on a thin layer near its surface, and input this information into an exact analytical solution of the elastic equilibrium equation. These operations are performed in the Fourier domain with high computational efficiency, allowing to obtain the 3D traction stresses from raw microscopy images virtually in real time. We also characterize the error of previous two-dimensional (2D) TFM methods that neglect the out-of-plane component of the traction stresses. This analysis reveals that, under certain combinations of experimental parameters (cell size, substratums' thickness and Poisson's ratio), the accuracy of 2D TFM methods is minimally affected by neglecting the out-of-plane component of the traction stresses. Finally, we consider the cell's mechanosensing of substratum thickness by 3D traction stresses, finding that, when cells adhere on thin substrata, their out-of-plane traction stresses can reach four times deeper into the substratum than their in-plane traction stresses. It is also found that the substratum stiffness sensed by applying out-of-plane traction stresses may be up to 10 times larger than the stiffness sensed by applying in-plane traction stresses.",

Here, we exploit the ability to manipulate histone genes in Dictyostelium to identify that ADPr of the histone variant H3b at S10 and S28 maintains genome stability by integrating double strand break (DSB) repair with mitotic entry. Given the critical requirement for mitotic H3S10/28 phosphorylation, we develop separation of function mutations that maintain S10 phosphorylation whilst disrupting ADPr. Mechanistically, this reveals a requirement for H3bS10/28 ADPr in non-homologous end-joining by recruiting Ku to DSBs. Moreover, this also identifies H3bS10/S28 ADPr is critical to prevent premature mitotic entry with unresolved DNA damage, thus maintaining genome stability. Together, these data demonstrate how serine ADPr of histones coordinates DNA repair with cell cycle progression to maintain genome stability.",

In yeast, the Endoplasmic Reticulum - Mitochondrion Encounter Structure (ERMES) tethers these two organelles likely to facilitate the non-vesicular exchange of essential phospholipids. Present in Fungi and Amoebas but not in Metazoans, ERMES is composed of five distinct subunits; among those, Mdm12, Mmm1 and Mdm34 each contain an SMP domain functioning as a lipid transfer module. We previously showed that the SMP domains of Mdm12 and Mmm1 form a hetero-tetramer. Here we describe our strategy to diversify the number of Mdm12/Mmm1 complexes suited for structural studies. We use sequence analysis of orthologues combined to protein engineering of disordered regions to guide the design of protein constructs and expand the repertoire of Mdm12/Mmm1 complexes more likely to crystallize. Using this combinatorial approach we report crystals of Mdm12/Mmm1 ERMES complexes currently diffracting to 4.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and a new structure of Mdm12 solved at 4.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Our structure reveals a monomeric form of Mdm12 with a conformationally dynamic N-terminal \u03b2-strand; it differs from a previously reported homodimeric structure where the N-terminal \u03b2 strands where swapped to promote dimerization. Based on our electron microscopy data, we propose a refined pseudo-atomic model of the Mdm12/Mmm1 complex that agrees with our crystallographic and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) solution data.",

        "abstract": "Nonsense mutations that result in the expression of truncated, N-terminal, fragments of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein are found in most sporadic and some hereditary colorectal cancers. These mutations can cause tumorigenesis by eliminating \u03b2-catenin-binding sites from APC, which leads to upregulation of \u03b2-catenin and thereby results in the induction of oncogenes such as MYC. Here we show that, in three distinct experimental model systems, expression of an N-terminal fragment of APC (N-APC) results in loss of directionality, but not speed, of cell motility independently of changes in \u03b2-catenin regulation. We developed a system to culture and fluorescently label live pieces of gut tissue to record high-resolution three-dimensional time-lapse movies of cells in situ. This revealed an unexpected complexity of normal gut cell migration, a key process in gut epithelial maintenance, with cells moving with spatial and temporal discontinuity. Quantitative comparison of gut tissue from wild-type mice and APC heterozygotes (APC(Min/+); multiple intestinal neoplasia model) demonstrated that cells in precancerous epithelia lack directional preference when moving along the crypt-villus axis. This effect was reproduced in diverse experimental systems: in developing chicken embryos, mesoderm cells expressing N-APC failed to migrate normally; in amoeboid Dictyostelium, which lack endogenous APC, expressing an N-APC fragment maintained cell motility, but the cells failed to perform directional chemotaxis; and multicellular Dictyostelium slug aggregates similarly failed to perform phototaxis. We propose that N-terminal fragments of APC represent a gain-of-function mutation that causes cells within tissue to fail to migrate directionally in response to relevant guidance cues. Consistent with this idea, crypts in histologically normal tissues of APC(Min/+) intestines are overpopulated with cells, suggesting that a lack of migration might cause cell accumulation in a precancerous state.",

However, the underlying module organization and variance remain unclear. In this study, we collected module templates to infer respective module families, including 58,041 homologous modules in 1,678 species, and PPI families using searches of complete genomic database. We then derived PPI evolution scores and interface evolution scores to describe the module elements, including core and ring components. Functions of core components were highly correlated with those of essential genes. In comparison with ring components, core proteins/PPIs were conserved across multiple species. Subsequently, protein/module variance of PPI networks confirmed that core components form dynamic network hubs and play key roles in various biological functions. Based on the analyses of gene essentiality, module variance, and gene co-expression, we summarize the observations of module organization and variance as follows: 1) a module consists of core and ring components; 2) core components perform major biological functions and collaborate with ring components to execute certain functions in some cases; 3) core components are more conserved and essential during organizational changes in different biological states or conditions.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is an important intracellular signaling molecule for many G protein-mediated signaling pathways but the specificity of cAMP signaling in cells with multiple signaling pathways is not well-understood. In Dictyostelium, at least two different G protein signaling pathways, mediated by the G\u03b12 and G\u03b14 subunits, are involved with cAMP accumulation, spore production, and chemotaxis and the stimulation of these pathways results in the activation of ERK2, a mitogen-activated protein kinase that can down regulate the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase RegA. The regA gene was disrupted in g\u03b12(\u2212) and g\u03b14(\u2212) cells to determine if the absence of this phosphodiesterase rescues the development of these G protein mutants as it does for erk2(\u2212) mutants. There gA(\u2212) mutation had no major effects on developmental morphology but enriched the distribution of the G\u03b1 mutant cells to the prespore/prestalk border in chimeric aggregates. The loss of RegA function had no effect on G\u03b14- mediated folate chemotaxis. However, the regA gene disruption in g\u03b14(\u2212) cells, but not in g\u03b12(\u2212) cells, resulted in a substantial rescue and acceleration of spore production. This rescue in sporulation required cell autonomous signaling because the precocious sporulation could not be induced through intercellular signaling in chimeric aggregates. However, intercellular signals from regA(\u2212) strains increased the expression of the prestalk gene ecmB and accelerated the vacuolization of stalk cells. Intercellular signaling from the g\u03b14(\u2212)regA(\u2212) strain did not induce ecmA gene expression indicating cell-type specificity in the promotion of prestalk cell development. regA gene disruption in a G\u03b14(HC) (G\u03b14 overexpression) strain did not result in precocious sporulation or stalk cell development indicating that elevated G\u03b14 subunit expression can mask regA(\u2212) associated phenotypes even when provided with wild-type intercellular signaling. These findings indicate that the G\u03b12 and G\u03b14-mediated pathways provide different contributions to the development of spores and stalk cells and that the absence of RegA function can bypass some but not all defects in G protein regulated spore development.",

Here, we show that this relationship is conserved in the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium and exploit this organism to define mechanisms that drive resistance of the HR-deficient cells to PARPi. Dictyostelium cells disrupted in exonuclease I, a critical factor for HR, are sensitive to PARPi. Deletion of exo1 prevents the accumulation of Rad51 in chromatin induced by PARPi, resulting in DNA damage being channelled through repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Inactivation of NHEJ supresses the sensitivity of exo1- cells to PARPi, indicating this pathway drives synthetic lethality and that in its absence alternative repair mechanisms promote cell survival. This resistance is independent of alternate-NHEJ and is instead achieved by re-activation of HR. Moreover, inhibitors of Mre11 restore sensitivity of dnapkcs-exo1- cells to PARPi, indicating redundancy between nucleases that initiate HR can drive PARPi resistance. These data inform on mechanism of PARPi resistance in HR-deficient cells and present Dictyostelium as a convenient genetic model to characterize these pathways.",

The ability to rapidly screen a large number of insertional mutants prompted us to perform a genetic screen in Dictyostelium to isolate adhesion-deficient mutants. The resulting substrate adhesion-deficient (sad) mutants grew in plastic dishes without attaching to the substrate. The cells were often larger than their wild-type parents and displayed a rough surface with many apparent blebs. One of these mutants, sadA-, completely lacked substrate adhesion in growth medium. The sadA- mutant also showed slightly impaired cytokinesis, an aberrant F-actin organization, and a phagocytosis defect. Deletion of the sadA gene by homologous recombination recreated the original mutant phenotype. Expression of sadA-GFP in sadA-null cells restored the wild-type phenotype. In sadA-GFP-rescued mutant cells, sadA-GFP localized to the cell surface, appropriate for an adhesion molecule. SadA contains nine putative transmembrane domains and three conserved EGF-like repeats in a predicted extracellular domain. The EGF repeats are similar to corresponding regions in proteins known to be involved in adhesion, such as tenascins and integrins. Our data combined suggest that sadA is the first substrate adhesion receptor to be identified in Dictyostelium.",

We have recently demonstrated that a targeted delivery of Dd-MRP4 (Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4) suppresses specifically the proliferation of the human cancer cells, by inducing their apoptotic cell death (Chida et al., 2014, doi:10.1186/1475-2867-14-56). This amazing fact was discovered, simply based on the finding that Dd-MRP4 expression is absolutely required for transition of Dictyostelium cells from growth to differentiation (Chida et al., 2008, doi:10.1186/1471-2156-9-25; Maeda et al., 2013, doi:10.3390/biom3040943). Dd-MRP4 protein has quite unique structural characters, in that it is highly basic (pI: about 11.5) and interestingly has several nuclear-localization signals within the molecule. In this review, we introduce briefly the efficacy of several apoptosis-inducing substances reported thus far for cancer therapy, and speculate the possible mechanisms, by which apoptosis is specifically induced by Dd-MRP4, on the basis of its structural uniqueness. We also discuss several issues to be solved for the medical application of ectopically expressed Dd-MRP4 in human cancer cells.",

We first construct a reasonable model of the myosin head and actin regions that meet to form the \"weakly bound state\". Separately, we consider Holmes' model of the rigor state [Holmes, K.

The protein is targeted to the plasma membrane, apparently in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and induces the formation of abundant actin-driven filopods. RacG is enriched at the rim of the progressing phagocytic cup, and overexpression of RacG-WT or RacG-V12 induced an increased rate of particle uptake. The positive effect of RacG on phagocytosis was abolished in the presence of 50 microM LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, indicating that generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is required for activation of RacG. RacG-KO cells showed a moderate chemotaxis defect that was stronger in the RacG-V12 and RacG-N17 mutants, in part because of interference with signaling through Rac1. The in vivo effects of RacG-V12 could not be reproduced by a mutant lacking the Rho insert region, indicating that this region is essential for interaction with downstream components. Processes like growth, pinocytosis, exocytosis, cytokinesis, and development were unaffected in Rac-KO cells and in the overexpressor mutants. In a cell-free system, RacG induced actin polymerization upon GTPgammaS stimulation, and this response could be blocked by an Arp3 antibody. While the mild phenotype of RacG-KO cells indicates some overlap with one or more Dictyostelium Rho GTPases, like Rac1 and RacB, the significant changes found in overexpressors show that RacG plays important roles. We hypothesize that RacG interacts with a subset of effectors, in particular those concerned with shape, motility, and phagocytosis.",

        "abstract": "The WASP family of proteins has emerged as important regulators that connect multiple signaling pathways to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Dictyostelium cells express WASP, as well as a WASP related protein, WASP-B, endoded by wasB gene. WASP-B contains many of the domains present in WASP. Analysis of wild type, wasB null cells revealed that WASP-B is required for proper control of F-actin polymerization in response to a cAMP gradient. Due to the lack of tight control on actin polymerization, wasB null cells exhibited higher level of F-actin polymerization. wasB(-) cells extend more de novo pseudopods laterally and their average life span is longer than those of wild type cells, causing more turns and inefficient chemotaxis. YFP-WASP-B appears to be uniformly distributed in the cytosol and shows no translocation to cortical membrane upon cAMP stimulation. Active RacC pull-down assay reveals that the level of active RacC in wasB(-) cells is significantly higher than wild type cells. Moreover, the distribution of active RacC is not localized in wasB(-) cells. We conclude that chemotaxis defects of wasB(-) cells are likely to result from the aberrant regulation of RacC activation and localization.",

        "abstract": "Cell migration is an essential process during many phases of development and adult life. Cells can either migrate as individuals or move in the context of tissues. Movement is controlled by internal and external signals, which activate complex signal transduction cascades resulting in highly dynamic and localised remodelling of the cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. To understand these processes, it will be necessary to identify the critical structural cytoskeletal components, their spatio-temporal dynamics as well as those of the signalling pathways that control them. Imaging plays an increasingly important and powerful role in the analysis of these spatio-temporal dynamics. We will highlight a variety of imaging techniques and their use in the investigation of various aspects of cell motility, and illustrate their role in the characterisation of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium and cell movement during gastrulation in chick embryos in more detail.",

        "abstract": "The active site of myosin contains a group of highly conserved amino acid residues whose roles in nucleotide hydrolysis and energy transduction might appear to be obvious from the initial structural and kinetic analyses but become less clear on deeper investigation. One such residue is Ser236 (Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II numbering) which was proposed to be involved in a hydrogen transfer network during gamma-phosphate hydrolysis of ATP, which would imply a critical function in ATP hydrolysis and motility. The S236A mutant protein shows a comparatively small decrease in hydrolytic activity and motility, and thus this residue does not appear to be essential. To understand better the contribution of Ser236 to the function of myosin, structural and kinetic studies have been performed on the S236A mutant protein. The structures of the D. discoideum motor domain (S1dC) S236A mutant protein in complex with magnesium pyrophosphate, MgAMPPNP, and MgADP.vanadate have been determined. In contrast to the previous structure of wild-type S1dC, the S236A.MgAMPPNP complex crystallized in the closed state. Furthermore, transient-state kinetics showed a 4-fold reduction of the nucleotide release step, suggesting that the mutation stabilizes a closed active site. The structures show that a water molecule approximately adopts the location of the missing hydroxyl of Ser236 in the magnesium pyrophosphate and MgAMPPNP structures. This study suggests that the S236A mutant myosin proceeds via a different structural mechanism than wild-type myosin, where the alternate mechanism is able to maintain near normal transient-state kinetic values.",

        "abstract": "Electron microscope studies have shown that the switched-off state of myosin II in muscle involves intramolecular interaction between the two heads of myosin and between one head and the tail. The interaction, seen in both myosin filaments and isolated molecules, inhibits activity by blocking actin-binding and ATPase sites on myosin. This interacting-heads motif is highly conserved, occurring in invertebrates and vertebrates, in striated, smooth, and nonmuscle myosin IIs, and in myosins regulated by both Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and regulatory light-chain phosphorylation. Our goal was to determine how early this motif arose by studying the structure of inhibited myosin II molecules from primitive animals and from earlier, unicellular species that predate animals. Myosin II from <i>Cnidaria</i> (sea anemones, jellyfish), the most primitive animals with muscles, and <i>Porifera</i> (sponges), the most primitive of all animals (lacking muscle tissue) showed the same interacting-heads structure as myosins from higher animals, confirming the early origin of the motif. The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> showed a similar, but modified, version of the motif, while the amoeba <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> and fission yeast (<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>) showed no head-head interaction, consistent with the different sequences and regulatory mechanisms of these myosins compared with animal myosin IIs. Our results suggest that head-head/head-tail interactions have been conserved, with slight modifications, as a mechanism for regulating myosin II activity from the emergence of the first animals and before. The early origins of these interactions highlight their importance in generating the inhibited (relaxed) state of myosin in muscle and nonmuscle cells.",

        "abstract": "The trajectory of moving eukaryotic cells depends on the kinetics and direction of extending pseudopods. The direction of pseudopods has been well studied to unravel mechanisms for chemotaxis, wound healing and inflammation. However, the kinetics of pseudopod extension-when and why do pseudopods start and stop- is equally important, but is largely unknown. Here the START and STOP of about 4000 pseudopods was determined in four different species, at four conditions and in nine mutants (fast amoeboids Dictyostelium and neutrophils, slow mesenchymal stem cells, and fungus B.d. chytrid with pseudopod and a flagellum). The START of a first pseudopod is a random event with a probability that is species-specific (23%/s for neutrophils). In all species and conditions, the START of a second pseudopod is strongly inhibited by the extending first pseudopod, which depends on parallel filamentous actin/myosin in the cell cortex. Pseudopods extend at a constant rate by polymerization of branched F-actin at the pseudopod tip, which requires the Scar complex. The STOP of pseudopod extension is induced by multiple inhibitory processes that evolve during pseudopod extension and mainly depend on the increasing size of the pseudopod. Surprisingly, no differences in pseudopod kinetics are detectable between polarized, unpolarized or chemotactic cells, and also not between different species except for small differences in numerical values. This suggests that the analysis has uncovered the fundament of cell movement with distinct roles for stimulatory branched F-actin in the protrusion and inhibitory parallel F-actin in the contractile cortex.",

        "abstract": "Binding of ligand to its receptor is a stochastic process that exhibits fluctuations in time and space. In chemotaxis, this leads to a noisy input signal. Therefore, in a gradient of chemoattractant, the cell may occasionally experience a \"wrong\" gradient of occupied receptors. We obtained a simple equation for P(pos), the probability that half of the cell closest to the source of chemoattractant has higher receptor occupancy than the opposite half of the cell. P(pos) depends on four factors, the gradient property delC/sq. root of C, the receptor characteristic R(t)/K(D), a time-averaging constant I, and nonreceptor noise sigma(B). We measured chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells to known shallow gradients of cAMP and obtained direct estimates for these constants. Furthermore, we observed that in shallow gradients, the measured chemotaxis index is correlated with P(pos), which suggests that chemotaxis in shallow gradients is a pure biased random walk. From the observed chemotaxis and derived time-averaging constant, we deduce that the gradient transducing second messenger has a lifetime of 2-8 s and a diffusion rate constant of approximately 1 microm(2)/s. Potential candidates for such second messengers are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis is fundamentally important, but the sources of gradients in vivo are rarely well understood. Here, we analyse self-generated chemotaxis, in which cells respond to gradients they have made themselves by breaking down globally available attractants, using both computational simulations and experiments. We show that chemoattractant degradation creates steep local gradients. This leads to surprising results, in particular the existence of a leading population of cells that moves highly directionally, while cells behind this group are undirected. This leading cell population is denser than those following, especially at high attractant concentrations. The local gradient moves with the leading cells as they interact with their surroundings, giving directed movement that is unusually robust and can operate over long distances. Even when gradients are applied from external sources, attractant breakdown greatly changes cells' responses and increases robustness. We also consider alternative mechanisms for directional decision-making and show that they do not predict the features of population migration we observe experimentally. Our findings provide useful diagnostics to allow identification of self-generated gradients and suggest that self-generated chemotaxis is unexpectedly universal in biology and medicine.",

In g\u03b12<sup>-</sup> cells the expression of the D-motif mutant (G\u03b12<sup>D-</sup>) or wild-type subunit from high copy number vectors rescued cell aggregation but blocked the transition of mounds into slugs. This phenotype was also observed in parental strains with a wild-type g\u03b12 locus indicating that the heterologous G\u03b12 subunit expression interferes with multicellular morphogenesis. Expression of the G\u03b12<sup>D-</sup> subunit from a low copy number vectors in g\u03b12<sup>-</sup> cells did not rescue aggregation whereas the wild-type G\u03b12 subunit rescued aggregation efficiently and allowed wild-type morphological development.

RacB activation is partly controlled by the PI3K pathway. pi3k1/2 null cells and wild-type cells treated with LY294002 exhibit a significantly reduced second peak of RacB activation, which is linked to pseudopod extension, whereas a PTEN hypomorph exhibits elevated RacB activation.

RacGEF1 localizes to sites of F-actin polymerization. Inhibition of this localization reduces RacB activation, suggesting a feedback loop from RacB via F-actin polymerization to RacGEF1.

We have identified Daydreamer (DydA), a new member of the Mig10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) family of adaptor proteins that localizes to the leading edge of the cell. DydA is a putative Ras effector that is required for cell polarization and directional movement during chemotaxis. dydA(-) cells exhibit elevated F-actin and assembled myosin II (MyoII), increased and extended phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, and extended phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKB and PKBR1, suggesting that DydA is involved in the negative regulation of these pathways. DydA is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), which is required for some, but not all, of DydA's functions, including the proper regulation of PKB and PKBR1 and MyoII assembly. gskA(-) cells exhibit very strong chemotactic phenotypes, as previously described, but exhibit an increased rate of random motility. gskA(-) cells have a reduced MyoII response and a reduced level of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate production, but a highly extended recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane and highly extended kinetics of PKB and PKBR1 activation.

Furthermore, in complementation assays we determined the roles of the individual domains in signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We studied in detail the adenylyl cyclase activity and found that the mutant cells have normal levels of the aggregation phase-specific adenylyl cyclase and that receptor-mediated activation is intact. However, cAMP relay that is responsible for the generation of propagating cAMP waves that control the chemotactic aggregation of starving Dictyostelium cells was altered, and the cAMP-induced cGMP production was significantly reduced.

        "abstract": "ADP-ribosylation is the post translational modification of proteins catalysed by ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs). ADP-ribosylation has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation. Perhaps the best characterised role, however, is in DNA repair and genome stability where ADP-ribosylation promotes resolution of DNA single strand breaks. Although ADP-ribosylation also occurs at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which ARTs catalyse this reaction and the molecular basis of how this modification regulates their repair remains a matter of debate. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how ADP-ribosylation regulates DSB repair. Specifically, we highlight studies using the genetic model organism Dictyostelium, in addition to vertebrate cells that identify a third ART that accelerates DSB repair by non-homologous end-joining through promoting the interaction of repair factors with DNA lesions. The implications of these data with regards to how ADP-ribosylation regulates DNA repair and genome stability are discussed.",

        "abstract": "For many proteins, especially for molecular motors and other enzymes, the functional mechanisms remain unsolved due to a gap between static structural data and kinetics. We have filled this gap by detecting structure and kinetics simultaneously. This structural kinetics experiment is made possible by a new technique, (TR)(2)FRET (transient time-resolved FRET), which resolves protein structural states on the submillisecond timescale during the transient phase of a biochemical reaction. (TR)(2)FRET is accomplished with a fluorescence instrument that uses a pulsed laser and direct waveform recording to acquire an accurate subnanosecond time-resolved fluorescence decay every 0.1 ms after stopped flow. To apply this method to myosin, we labeled the force-generating region site specifically with two probes, mixed rapidly with ATP to initiate the recovery stroke, and measured the interprobe distance by (TR)(2)FRET with high resolution in both space and time. We found that the relay helix bends during the recovery stroke, most of which occurs before ATP is hydrolyzed, and two structural states (relay helix straight and bent) are resolved in each nucleotide-bound biochemical state. Thus the structural transition of the force-generating region of myosin is only loosely coupled to the ATPase reaction, with conformational selection driving the motor mechanism.",

In both cell types, addition of chemoattractants stimulates the production of cAMP, which has been suggested to regulate chemotaxis. We set out to define the mechanism by which chemoattractants increase cAMP levels in human neutrophils. We show that chemoattractants elicit a rapid and transient activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC). This activation is sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment but independent of phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity and an intact cytoskeleton. Remarkably, and in sharp contrast to Galpha(s)-mediated activation, chemoattractant-induced AC activation is lost in cell lysates. Of the nine, differentially regulated transmembrane AC isoforms in the human genome, we find that isoforms III, IV, VII, and IX are expressed in human neutrophils. We conclude that the signal transduction cascade used by chemoattractants to activate AC is conserved in Dictyostelium and human neutrophils and is markedly different from the canonical Galpha(s)-meditated pathway.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating TORC2 activity and function in any system. In Dictyostelium, TORC2 functions at the front of migrating cells downstream of the Ras protein RasC, controlling F-actin dynamics and cAMP production. Here, we report the identification of the small GTPase Rap1 as a conserved binding partner of the TORC2 component RIP3/SIN1, and that Rap1 positively regulates the RasC-mediated activation of TORC2 in Dictyostelium. Moreover, we show that active RasC binds to the catalytic domain of TOR, suggesting a mechanism of TORC2 activation that is similar to Rheb activation of TOR complex 1. Dual Ras/Rap1 regulation of TORC2 may allow for integration of Ras and Rap1 signaling pathways in directed cell migration.",

        "abstract": "We have cloned a P2X receptor (OtP2X) from the green algae Ostreococcus tauri. The 42-kDa receptor shares approximately 28% identity with human P2X receptors and 23% with the Dictyostelium P2X receptor. ATP application evoked flickery single channel openings in outside-out membrane patches from human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing OtP2X. Whole-cell recordings showed concentration-dependent cation currents reversing close to zero mV; ATP gave a half-maximal current at 250 mum. alphabeta-Methylene-ATP evoked only small currents in comparison to ATP (EC(50) > 5 mm). 2',3'-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP, betagamma-imido-ATP, ADP, and several other nucleotide triphosphates did not activate any current. The currents evoked by 300 mum ATP were not inhibited by 100 microm suramin, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenol)-ATP, or copper. Ion substitution experiments indicated permeabilities relative to sodium with the rank order calcium >choline >Tris >tetraethylammonium >N-methyl-D-glucosamine. However, OtP2X had a low relative calcium permeability (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.4) in comparison with other P2X receptors. This was due at least in part to the presence of an asparagine residue (Asn(353)) at a position in the second transmembrane domain in place of the aspartate that is completely conserved in all other P2X receptor subunits, because replacement of Asn(353) with aspartate increased calcium permeability by approximately 50%. The results indicate that the ability of ATP to gate cation permeation across membranes exists in cells that diverged in evolutionary terms from animals about 1 billion years ago.",

        "abstract": "Cell migration often involves the formation of sheet-like lamellipodia generated by branched actin filaments. The branches are initiated when Arp2/3 complex [1] is activated by WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) downstream of small GTPases of the Rac family [2]. Recent structural studies defined two independent Rac binding sites on WRC within the Sra-1/PIR121 subunit of the pentameric WRC [3, 4], but the functions of these sites in\u00a0vivo have remained unknown. Here we dissect the mechanism of WRC activation and the in\u00a0vivo relevance of distinct Rac binding sites on Sra-1, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption of Sra-1 and its paralog PIR121 in murine B16-F1 cells combined with Sra-1 mutant rescue. We show that the A site, positioned adjacent to the binding region of WAVE-WCA mediating actin and Arp2/3 complex binding, is the main site for allosteric activation of WRC. In contrast, the D site toward the C terminus is dispensable for WRC activation but required for optimal lamellipodium morphology and function. These results were confirmed in evolutionarily distant Dictyostelium cells. Moreover, the phenotype seen in D site mutants was recapitulated in Rac1 E31 and F37 mutants; we conclude these residues are important for Rac-D site interaction. Finally, constitutively activated WRC was able to induce lamellipodia even after both Rac interaction sites were lost, showing that Rac interaction is not essential for membrane recruitment. Our data establish that physical interaction with Rac is required for\u00a0WRC activation, in particular through the A site, but is not mandatory for WRC accumulation in the lamellipodium.",

Understanding how those mating systems impact the possible distributions of F IS values in theoretical populations helps to unravel forces shaping the evolution of real populations. We proposed a population genetics model based on genotypic states in a finite population with mutation. For populations with less than 400 individuals, we assessed the impact of the rates of asexuality on the full exact distributions of F IS, the probabilities of positive and negative F IS, the probabilities of fixation and the probabilities to observe changes in the sign of F IS over one generation. After an infinite number of generations, we distinguished three main patterns of effects of the rates of asexuality on genetic diversity that also varied according to the interactions of mutation and genetic drift. Even rare asexual events in mainly sexual populations impacted the balance between negative and positive F IS and the occurrence of extreme values. It also drastically modified the probability to change the sign of F IS value at one locus over one generation. When mutation prevailed over genetic drift, increasing rates of asexuality continuously increased the variance of F IS that reached its highest value in fully asexual populations. In consequence, even ancient asexual populations showed the entire F IS spectrum, including strong positive F IS. The prevalence of heterozygous loci only occurred in full asexual populations when genetic drift dominated.",

        "abstract": "Differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) is a polyketide that induces Dictyostelium amoebae to differentiate as prestalk cells. We performed a global quantitative screen for phosphorylation changes that occur within the first minutes after addition of DIF-1, using a triple-label SILAC approach. This revealed a new world of DIF-1-controlled signaling, with changes in components of the MAPK and protein kinase B signaling pathways, components of the actinomyosin cytoskeletal signaling networks, and a broad range of small GTPases and their regulators. The results also provide evidence that the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin plays a role in DIF-1 signaling to the DimB prestalk transcription factor. At the global level, DIF-1 causes a major shift in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation equilibrium toward net dephosphorylation. Of interest, many of the sites that are dephosphorylated in response to DIF-1 are phosphorylated in response to extracellular cAMP signaling. This accords with studies that suggest an antagonism between the two inducers and also with the rapid dephosphorylation of the cAMP receptor that we observe in response to DIF-1 and with the known inhibitory effect of DIF-1 on chemotaxis to cAMP.

We found that cAMP induces the cAR1-mediated dissociation of the G protein subunits to a similar extent in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, suggesting that only a small number of cAR1 (as expressed in undifferentiated cells) is necessary to induce the full activation of G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3. In addition, we found that treating cells with caffeine increases the potency of cAMP-induced G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3 activation; and that disrupting the microtubule network but not F-actin inhibits the cAMP-induced dissociation of G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3. Thus, microtubules are necessary for efficient cAR1-mediated activation of the heterotrimeric G protein. Finally, kinetics analyses of G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3 subunit dissociation induced by different cAMP concentrations indicate that there are two distinct rates at which the heterotrimeric G protein subunits dissociate when cells are stimulated with cAMP concentrations above 500\u202fnM versus only one rate at lower cAMP concentrations. Quantitative modeling suggests that the kinetics profile of G\u03b12\u03b2\u03b3 subunit dissociation results from the presence of both uncoupled and G protein pre-coupled cAR1 that have differential affinities for cAMP and, consequently, induce G protein subunit dissociation through different rates. We suggest that these different signaling kinetic profiles may play an important role in initial chemoattractant gradient sensing.",

        "abstract": "Mammalian cells encode three closely related Ras proteins, H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras. Oncogenic K-Ras mutations frequently occur in human cancers, which lead to dysregulated cell proliferation and genomic instability. However, mechanistic role of the Ras isoform regulation have remained largely unknown. Furthermore, the dynamics and function of negative regulation of GTP-loaded K-Ras have not been fully investigated. Here, we demonstrate RasG, the Dictyostelium orthologue of K-Ras, is targeted for degradation by polyubiquitination. Both ubiquitination and degradation of RasG were strictly associated with RasG activity. High resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis indicated that RasG ubiquitination occurs at C-terminal lysines equivalent to lysines found in human K-Ras but not in H-Ras and N-Ras homologues. Substitution of these lysine residues with arginines (4KR-RasG) diminished RasG ubiquitination and increased RasG protein stability. Cells expressing 4KR-RasG failed to undergo proper cytokinesis and resulted in multinucleated cells. Ectopically expressed human K-Ras undergoes polyubiquitin-mediated degradation in Dictyostelium, whereas human H-Ras and a Dictyostelium H-Ras homologue (RasC) are refractory to ubiquitination. Our results indicate the existence of GTP-loaded K-Ras orthologue-specific degradation system in Dictyostelium, and further identification of the responsible E3-ligase may provide a novel therapeutic approach against K-Ras-mutated cancers.",

Overexpression of the 14-3-3 proteins \u03c3, \u03f5, \u03b6, and \u03b7 correlates with high metastatic potential in multiple cancer types. In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, 14-3-3 promotes myosin II turnover in the cell cortex and modulates cortical tension, cell shape, and cytokinesis. In light of the important roles of 14-3-3 proteins across a broad range of eukaryotic species, we sought to determine how 14-3-3 proteins interact with myosin II. Here, conducting <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies of both <i>Dictyostelium</i> (one 14-3-3 and one myosin II) and human proteins (seven 14-3-3s and three nonmuscle myosin IIs), we investigated the mechanism by which 14-3-3 proteins regulate myosin II assembly. Using <i>in vitro</i> assembly assays with purified myosin II tail fragments and 14-3-3, we demonstrate that this interaction is direct and phosphorylation-independent. All seven human 14-3-3 proteins also altered assembly of at least one paralog of myosin II. Our findings indicate a mechanism of myosin II assembly regulation that is mechanistically conserved across a billion years of evolution from amebas to humans. We predict that altered 14-3-3 expression in humans inhibits the tumor suppressor myosin II, contributing to the changes in cell mechanics observed in many metastatic cancers.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular transport is interspersed with frequent reversals in direction due to the presence of opposing kinesin and dynein motors on organelles that are carried as cargo. The cause and the mechanism of reversals are unknown, but are a key to understanding how cargos are delivered in a regulated manner to specific cellular locations. Unlike established single-motor biophysical assays, this problem requires understanding of the cooperative behavior of multiple interacting motors. Here we present measurements inside live Dictyostelium cells, in a cell extract and with purified motors to quantify such an ensemble function of motors. We show through precise motion analysis that reversals during endosome motion are caused by a tug-of-war between kinesin and dynein. Further, we use a combination of optical trap-based force measurements and Monte Carlo simulations to make the surprising discovery that endosome transport uses many (approximately four to eight) weak and detachment-prone dyneins in a tug-of-war against a single strong and tenacious kinesin. We elucidate how this clever choice of dissimilar motors and motor teams achieves net transport together with endosome fission, both of which are important in controlling the balance of endocytic sorting. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique demonstration that dynein and kinesin function differently at the molecular level inside cells and of how this difference is used in a specific cellular process, namely endosome biogenesis. Our work may provide a platform to understand intracellular transport of a variety of organelles in terms of measurable quantities.",

        "abstract": "The tumor suppressor function of PTEN is strongly linked to its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 trisphosphate and, thereby, control cell growth, survival, and migration. However, the mechanism of action of PTEN in living cells is largely unexplored. Here we use single-molecule TIRF microscopy in living cells to reveal that the enzyme binds to the membrane for a few hundred milliseconds, sufficient to degrade several phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 trisphosphate molecules. Deletion of an N-terminal lipid-binding motif completely abrogates membrane interaction and in vivo function. Several mechanisms, including C-terminal tail phosphorylations, appear to hold PTEN in a constrained conformation that limits its rate of association with the membrane. The steady-state level of bound PTEN is highest at sites of retracting membrane, including the rear of highly polarized cells. The dynamic membrane association could be modulated temporally or spatially to alter PTEN activity in specific physiological situations and could have important implications for tumor suppressor function.",

        "abstract": "Caffeine is commonly used in Dictyostelium to inhibit the synthesis of the chemoattractant cAMP and, therefore, its secretion and the autocrine stimulation of cells, in order to prevent its interference with the study of chemoattractant-induced responses. However, the mechanism through which caffeine inhibits cAMP synthesis in Dictyostelium has not been characterized. Here, we report the effects of caffeine on the cAMP chemoattractant signaling network. We found that caffeine inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). Both PI3K and mTORC2 are essential for the chemoattractant-stimulated cAMP production, thereby providing a mechanism for the caffeine-mediated inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Our results also reveal that caffeine treatment of cells leads to an increase in cAMP-induced RasG and Rap1 activation, and inhibition of the PKA, cGMP, MyoII, and ERK1 responses. Finally, we observed that caffeine has opposite effects on F-actin and ERK2 depending on the assay and Dictyostelium strain used, respectively. Altogether, our findings reveal that caffeine considerably affects the cAMP-induced chemotactic signaling pathways in Dictyostelium, most likely acting through multiple targets that include PI3K and mTORC2.",

Activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is at the very base of the chemotactic signaling pathway. Chemotaxis starts with binding of the chemoattractant to GPCRs at the cell-surface, which finally leads to major changes in the cytoskeleton and directional cell movement towards the chemoattractant. Many chemotaxis pathways that are directly regulated by G\u03b2\u03b3 have been identified and studied extensively; however, whether G\u03b1 is just a handle that regulates the release of G\u03b2\u03b3 or whether G\u03b1 has its own set of distinct chemotactic effectors, is only beginning to be understood. In this review, we will discuss the different levels of regulation in GPCR signaling and the downstream pathways that are essential for proper chemotaxis.",

        "abstract": "Lipids are the building blocks for cellular membranes; they provide signalling molecules for membrane dynamics and serve as energy stores. One path of their synthesis is initiated by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), which in <i>Dictyostelium</i> resides on the endoplasmic reticulum. When an excess of fatty acids is present, it redistributes to storage organelles, the lipid droplets. Mutants, where the GPAT was eliminated by homologous recombination, produce fewer lipid droplets and are almost devoid of triacylglycerols (TAG), rendering them more resistant to cell death and cell loss in the developmental stages preceding fruiting body formation. The enzyme most closely related to GPAT is called FARAT, because it combines a fatty acyl-reductase (FAR) and an acyltransferase (AT) domain in its sequence. The protein is confined to the lumen of the peroxisome, where it transfers a fatty acid to dihydroxyacetone-phosphate initiating the synthesis of ether lipids, later completed at the endoplasmic reticulum. A mutant lacking FARAT produces lipid droplets that are devoid of the storage lipid monoalkyl-diacyl-glycerol (MDG), but the efficiency of spore formation in the developmental cycle is largely unaltered. Instead, these mutants are strongly impaired in phagocytosis of yeast particles, which is attributed to reduced synthesis of membrane phospholipids containing ether-linked chains.",

We show that in resting cells the major fraction of the sGC-GFP fusion protein localizes to the cytosol, and a small fraction is associated to the cell cortex. With the artificial substrate Mn2+/GTP, sGC activity and protein exhibit a similar distribution between soluble and particulate fraction of cell lysates. However, with the physiological substrate Mg2+/GTP, sGC in the cytosol is nearly inactive, whereas the particulate enzyme shows high enzyme activity. Reconstitution experiments reveal that inactive cytosolic sGC acquires catalytic activity with Mg2+/GTP upon association to the membrane. Stimulation of cells with cAMP results in a twofold increase of membrane-localized sGC-GFP, which is accompanied by an increase of the membrane-associated guanylyl cyclase activity. In a cAMP gradient, sGC-GFP localizes to the anterior cell cortex, suggesting that in chemotacting cells, sGC is activated at the leading edge of the cell.",

        "abstract": "Two motors can drive extension of the leading edge of motile cells: actin polymerization and myosin-driven contraction of the cortex, producing fluid pressure and the formation of blebs. Dictyostelium cells can move with both blebs and actin-driven pseudopods at the same time, and blebs, like pseudopods, can be orientated by chemotactic gradients. Here we ask how bleb sites are selected and how the two forms of projection cooperate. We show that membrane curvature is an important, yet overlooked, factor. Dictyostelium cells were observed moving under agarose, which efficiently induces blebbing, and the dynamics of membrane deformations were analyzed. Blebs preferentially originate from negatively curved regions, generated on the flanks of either extending pseudopods or blebs themselves. This is true of cells at different developmental stages, chemotaxing to either folate or cyclic AMP and moving with both blebs and pseudopods or with blebs only. A physical model of blebbing suggests that detachment of the cell membrane is facilitated in concave areas of the cell, where membrane tension produces an outward directed force, as opposed to pulling inward in convex regions. Our findings assign a role to membrane tension in spatially coupling blebs and pseudopods, thus contributing to clustering protrusions to the cell front.",

To provide information about the structural elements important for Pi release, possible escape pathways from various isolated myosin II structures have been determined by molecular dynamics simulations designed for studying such slow processes. The residues forming the pathways were identified and their role was evaluated by mutant simulations. Pi release is slow in the pre-powerstroke structure, an important element in preventing the powerstroke prior to actin binding, and is much more rapid for Pi modeled into the post-rigor and rigor-like structures. The previously proposed backdoor route is dominant in the pre-powerstroke and post-rigor states, whereas a different path is most important in the rigor-like state. This finding suggests a mechanism for the actin-activated acceleration of Pi release.",

These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, as are all examined structures based on PIP<sub>3</sub> patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones.

Both processes are regulated by Ras signaling, which is precisely controlled by mechanisms involving Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs) responsible for terminating Ras activity on early endosomes. While regulation of Ras signaling during large-scale endocytosis in WT <i>Dictyostelium</i> has been, for the most part, attributed to the <i>Dictyostelium</i> ortholog of human RasGAP NF1, in commonly used axenic laboratory strains, this gene is mutated and inactive. Moreover, none of the RasGAPs characterized so far have been implicated in the regulation of Ras signaling in large-scale endocytosis in axenic strains. In this study, we establish, using biochemical approaches and complementation assays in live cells, that <i>Dictyostelium</i> IQGAP-related protein IqgC interacts with active RasG and exhibits RasGAP activity toward this GTPase. Analyses of <i>iqgC</i><sup><i>-</i></sup> and IqgC-overexpressing cells further revealed participation of this GAP in the regulation of both types of large-scale endocytosis and in cytokinesis. Moreover, given the localization of IqgC to phagosomes and, most prominently, to macropinosomes, we propose IqgC acting as a RasG-specific GAP in large-scale endocytosis. The data presented here functionally distinguish IqgC from other members of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> IQGAP family and call for repositioning of this genuine RasGAP outside of the IQGAP group.",

Based on the current knowledge, we draw a model for nuclear envelope organization in Dictyostelium in this Extra View and we review the experimental data that justified this classification. Furthermore we provide unpublished data underscoring the requirement of posttranslational CaaX-box processing for proper protein localization at the nuclear envelope. Sequence comparison of NE81 sequences from four Dictyostelia with bona fide lamins illustrates the evolutional relationship between these proteins.

We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of P(i) with the back door and the plausibility of P(i) release via this route. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the Dictyostelium motor domain with bound Mg.adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and P(i), modeled upon the Mg.ADP.BeF(x) and Mg.ADP.V(i) structures. Simulations revealed that the relaxation of ADP and free P(i) from their initial positions reduced the diameter of the back door via motions of switch 1 and switch 2 located in the upper and lower 50-kDa subdomains, respectively. In neither simulation could P(i) freely diffuse out the back door. Water molecules, however, could flux through the back door in the Mg.ADP.BeF(x)-based simulation but not in the Mg.ADP.V(i)-based simulation. In neither structure was water observed fluxing through the main (front door) entrance. These observations suggest that the ability of P(i) to leave via the back door is linked tightly to conformational changes between the upper and lower 50-kDa subdomains. The simulations offer structural explanations for (18)O-exchange with P(i) at the active site, and P(i) release being the rate-limiting step in the myosin adenosine 5'-triphosphatase.",

Using in vitro TIRF microscopy, we show for the first time that both human and Dictyostelium VASP are directly involved in accelerating filament elongation by delivering monomeric actin to the growing barbed end. In solution, DdVASP markedly accelerated actin filament elongation in a concentration-dependent manner but was inhibited by low concentrations of capping protein (CP). In striking contrast, VASP clustered on functionalized beads switched to processive filament elongation that became insensitive even to very high concentrations of CP. Supplemented with the in vivo analysis of VASP mutants and an EM structure of the protein, we propose a mechanism by which membrane-associated VASP oligomers use their WH2 domains to effect both the tethering of actin filaments and their processive elongation in sites of active actin assembly.",

        "title": "Actin Waves and Dynamic Patterning of the Plasma Membrane.",
        "abstract": "Plasma membrane and underlying actin network are connected to a functional unit that by non-linear interactions is capable of forming patterns. For instance, in cell motility and chemotaxis, cells polarize to form a protruding front and a retracting tail. Here we address dynamic patterns that are formed on a planar substrate surface and are therefore easily accessible to optical recording. In these patterns two distinct areas of the membrane and actin cortex are interconverted at the site of circular actin waves. The inner territory circumscribed by a wave is distinguished from the external area by a high PIP3 content and high Ras activity. In contrast, the external area is occupied with the PIP3-degrading phosphatase PTEN. In the underlying cortex, these areas differ in the proteins associated with the actin network. Actin waves can be formed at zones of increasing as well as decreasing Ras activity. Both types of waves are headed by myosin IB. When waves collide, they usually extinguish each other, and their decay is accompanied by the accumulation of coronin. No membrane patterns have been observed after efficient depolymerization of actin, suggesting that residual actin filaments are necessary for the pattern generating system to work. Where appropriate, we relate the experimental data obtained with <i>Dictyostelium</i> to human normal and malignant cell behavior, in particular to the role of Ras-GAP as an enhancer of macropinocytosis, to mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, to frustrated phagocytosis, and to the role of coronin in immune cells and neurons.",

Phylogenetic analysis of MF myosin domains suggests that a single ancestral MF myosin existed with a structure similar to DdMyo7, which has two MF domains, and that subsequent duplications in the metazoan lineage produced its functional homolog Myo10. The essential functional features of the DdMyo7 myosin were identified using quantitative live-cell imaging to characterize the ability of various mutants to rescue filopod formation in myo7-null cells. The two MF domains were found to function redundantly in filopod formation with the C-terminal FERM domain regulating both the number of filopodia and their elongation velocity. DdMyo7 mutants consisting solely of the motor plus a single MyTH4 domain were found to be capable of rescuing the formation of filopodia, establishing the minimal elements necessary for the function of this myosin. Interestingly, a chimeric myosin with the Myo10 MF domain fused to the DdMyo7 motor also was capable of rescuing filopod formation in the myo7-null mutant, supporting fundamental functional conservation between these two distant myosins. Together, these findings reveal that MF myosins have an ancient and conserved role in filopod formation.",

Mutations in the respective genes, tgrB1 and tgrC1, abrogate both development and allorecognition and the defects cannot be suppressed by activation of the cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase PKA, a central regulator of Dictyostelium development. Here we report that mutations in genes outside the known PKA pathway partially suppress the tgrC1-null developmental defect. We separated the pleiotropic roles of tgrC1 by testing the effects of a suppression mutation, stcinsA under different conditions. stcAins modified only the developmental defect of tgrC1- but not the allorecognition defect, suggesting that the two functions are separable. The suppressor mutant phenotype also revealed that tgrC1 regulates stalk differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner and spore differentiation in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Moreover, stcAins did not modify the developmental defect of tgrB1-, but the less robust phenotype of tgrB1- obscures the possible role of stcA relative to tgrB1.",

        "abstract": "Further improvement of the thermostability of inherently thermostable proteins is an attractive challenge because more thermostable proteins are industrially more useful and serve as better scaffolds for protein engineering. To establish guidelines that can be applied for the rational design of hyperthermostable proteins, we compared the amino acid sequences of two ancestral nucleoside diphosphate kinases, Arc1 and Bac1, reconstructed in our previous study. Although Bac1 is a thermostable protein whose unfolding temperature is around 100\u00b0C, Arc1 is much more thermostable with an unfolding temperature of 114\u00b0C. However, only 12 out of 139 amino acids are different between the two sequences. In this study, one or a combination of amino acid(s) in Bac1 was/were substituted by a residue(s) found in Arc1 at the same position(s). The best mutant, which contained three amino acid substitutions (S108D, G116A and L120P substitutions), showed an unfolding temperature more than 10\u00b0C higher than that of Bac1. Furthermore, a combination of the other nine amino acid substitutions also led to improved thermostability of Bac1, although the effects of individual substitutions were small. Therefore, not only the sum of the contributions of individual amino acids, but also the synergistic effects of multiple amino acids are deeply involved in the stability of a hyperthermostable protein. Such insights will be helpful for future rational design of hyperthermostable proteins.",

        "abstract": "Starving Dictyostelium cells respond chemotactically to cell-generated waves of cyclic adenosine -3',5'- monophosphate (cAMP) that guide cell aggregation toward a signaling center. In this process, a large number of cells are recruited, resulting in the formation of aggregation territories that are essential for fruiting body formation. The enzyme PdsA phosphodiesterase (PDE), a crucial component of the signaling system, breaks down the external cAMP and can be either membrane-bound or secreted. The existence of two such forms is unusual in cell biology, and it remains to be determined why they have both been maintained through evolution. Here, using a model of the cAMP signaling system, I show that colonies can successfully organize into aggregates over a wider range of initial cell densities when both forms of PDE are present in an appropriately tuned ratio than when only a single form is present. The model indicates that membrane-bound PDE maintains aggregation-territory integrity in colonies with high initial cell density, whereas the secreted form is important for wave propagation at low cell densities. Thus, the ultimate retention of both forms can increase territory size. These findings have implications for other excitable media, including Ca(2+) propagation in cardiac cells and propagation of electrical excitation in nerve axons, since these systems have similar features of spatial nonuniform \"release\" and \"degradation\" of the relevant signals.",

Here, we show that removal of the so-called 'spacer-1' domain (residues 86-322) results in cleavage almost exclusively at a second S1P consensus sequence located upstream of K928. In addition, GlcNAc-1-PT lacking spacer-1 exhibits enhanced phosphorylation of several non-lysosomal glycoproteins, while the phosphorylation of lysosomal acid hydrolases is not altered. In view of these effects on the maturation and function of GlcNAc-1-PT, we suggest renaming `spacer-1' the `regulatory-1' domain.",

        "abstract": "In correctly predicting that selection efficiency is positively correlated with the effective population size (Ne), the nearly neutral theory provides a coherent understanding of between-species variation in numerous genomic parameters, including heritable error (germline mutation) rates. Does the same theory also explain variation in phenotypic error rates and in abundance of error mitigation mechanisms? Translational read-through provides a model to investigate both issues as it is common, mostly nonadaptive, and has good proxy for rate (TAA being the least leaky stop codon) and potential error mitigation via \"fail-safe\" 3' additional stop codons (ASCs). Prior theory of translational read-through has suggested that when population sizes are high, weak selection for local mitigation can be effective thus predicting a positive correlation between ASC enrichment and Ne. Contra to prediction, we find that ASC enrichment is not correlated with Ne. ASC enrichment, although highly phylogenetically patchy, is, however, more common both in unicellular species and in genes expressed in unicellular modes in multicellular species. By contrast, Ne does positively correlate with TAA enrichment. These results imply that local phenotypic error rates, not local mitigation rates, are consistent with a drift barrier/nearly neutral model.",

T6SS delivers effectors to neighboring cells and corresponding antagonistic proteins confer immunity against effectors that are delivered by sister cells. Although T6SS has been found in more than 100 gram-negative bacteria including many important human pathogens, few T6SS-dependent effector and immunity proteins have been experimentally determined. Here we report a high-throughput approach using transposon mutagenesis and deep sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify T6SS immunity proteins in Vibrio cholerae. Saturating transposon mutagenesis was performed in wild type and a T6SS null mutant. Genes encoding immunity proteins were predicted to be essential in the wild type but dispensable in the T6SS mutant. By comparing the relative abundance of each transposon mutant in the mutant library using deep sequencing, we identified three immunity proteins that render protection against killing by T6SS predatory cells. We also identified their three cognate T6SS-secreted effectors and show these are important for not only antibacterial and antieukaryotic activities but also assembly of T6SS apparatus. The lipase and muramidase T6SS effectors identified in this study underscore the diversity of T6SS-secreted substrates and the distinctly different mechanisms that target these for secretion by the dynamic T6SS organelle.",

Prior genetic studies have implicated Skp1 and its modification by these enzymes in O(2) regulation of development, suggesting the existence of an ancient O(2)-sensing mechanism related to modification of the transcription factor HIF\u03b1 by animal prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs). To better understand the role of Skp1 in P4H1-dependent O(2) signaling, biochemical and biophysical studies were conducted to characterize the reaction product and the basis of Skp1 substrate selection by P4H1 and Gnt1. (1)H NMR demonstrated formation of 4(trans)-hydroxyproline as previously found for HIF\u03b1, and highly purified P4H1 was inhibited by Krebs cycle intermediates and other compounds that affect animal P4Hs. However, in contrast to hydroxylation of HIF\u03b1 by PHDs, P4H1 depended on features of full-length Skp1, based on truncation, mutagenesis, and competitive inhibition studies. These features are conserved during animal evolution, as even mammalian Skp1, which lacks the target proline, became a good substrate upon its restoration. P4H1 recognition may depend on features conserved for SCF complex formation as heterodimerization with an F-box protein blocked Skp1 hydroxylation. The hydroxyproline-capping enzyme Gnt1 exhibited similar requirements for Skp1 as a substrate. These and other findings support a model in which the protist P4H1 conditionally hydroxylates Skp1 of E3(SCF)ubiquitin ligases to control half-lives of multiple targets, rather than the mechanism of animal PHDs where individual proteins are hydroxylated leading to ubiquitination by the evolutionarily related E3(VBC)ubiquitin ligases.",

Herein, we have created a DdCP224 promoter replacement mutant that allows both over- and underexpression. Overexpression led to supernumerary microtubule-organizing centers and, independently, an increase of the number of multinuclear cells. Electron microscopy demonstrated that supernumerary microtubule-organizing centers represented bona fide centrosomes. Live cell imaging of DdCP224-green fluorescent protein mutants also expressing green fluorescent protein-histone2B as a DNA label revealed that supernumerary centrosomes were also competent of cell cycle-dependent duplication. In contrast, underexpression of DdCP224 inhibited cell growth, reduced the number and length of astral microtubules, and caused nocodazole hypersensitivity. Moreover, microtubule regrowth after nocodazole removal was dependent on DdCP224. Underexpression also resulted in a striking disappearance of supernumerary centrosomes and multinuclear cells caused by previous overexpression. We show for the first time by live cell observation that the number of supernumerary centrosomes can be reduced either by centrosome fusion (coalescence) or by the formation of cytoplasts containing supernumerary centrosomes during cytokinesis.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular active transport is driven by ATP-hydrolyzing motor proteins that move along cytoskeletal filaments. In particular, the microtubule-associated dynein motor is involved in the transport of organelles and vesicles, the maintenance of the Golgi, and mitosis. However, unlike kinesin and myosin, the mechanism by which dynein converts chemical energy into mechanical force remains largely a mystery, due primarily to the lack of a high-resolution molecular structure. Using homology modeling and normal mode analysis, we propose a complete atomic structure and a mechanism for force generation by the motor protein dynein. In agreement with very recent electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions showing dynein as a ring-shaped heptamer, our model consists of six ATPases of the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily and a C-terminal domain, which is experimentally known to control motor function. Our model shows a coiled coil spanning the diameter of the motor that accounts for previously unidentified structures in EM studies and provides a potential mechanism for long-range communication between the AAA domains. Furthermore, normal mode analysis reveals that the subunits of the motor that contain the nucleotide binding sites exhibit minimal movement, whereas the rest of the motor is very mobile. Our analysis suggests the likely domain rearrangements of the motor unit that generate its power stroke. This study provides insights into the structure and function of dynein that can guide further experimental investigations into energy transduction in dynein.",

        "abstract": "Myristoylation, the covalent linkage of a saturated, C(14) fatty acyl chain to the N-terminal glycine in a protein, plays a vital role in reversible membrane binding and signaling by the modified proteins. Currently, little is known about the effects of myristoylation on protein folding and stability, or about the energetics and molecular mechanisms of switching involving states with sequestered versus accessible myristoyl group. Our analysis of these effects in hisactophilin, a histidine-rich protein that binds cell membranes and actin in a pH-dependent manner, shows that myristoylation significantly increases hisactophilin stability, while also markedly increasing global protein folding and unfolding rates. The switching between sequestered and accessible states is pH dependent, with an apparent pK(switch) of 6.95, and an apparent free energy change of 2.0 kcal\u00b7mol(-1). The myristoyl switch is linked to the reversible uptake of \u223c1.5 protons, likely by histidine residues. This pH dependence of switching appears to be the physical basis of the sensitive, pH-dependent regulation of membrane binding observed in vivo. We conclude that an increase in protein stability upon modification and burial of the attached group is likely to occur in numerous proteins modified with fatty acyl or other hydrophobic groups, and that the biophysical effects of such modification are likely to play an important role in their functional switches. In addition, the increased global dynamics caused by myristoylation of hisactophilin reveals a general mechanism whereby hydrophobic moieties can make nonnative interactions or relieve strain in transition states, thereby increasing the rates of interconversion between different states.",

        "abstract": "Annexin 7 (ANX7) acts as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, where loss of heterozygosity and reduction of ANX7 protein expression is associated with aggressive metastatic tumors. To investigate the mechanism by which this gene controls tumor development, we have developed an Anx7(+/-) knockout mouse. As hypothesized, the Anx7(+/-) mouse has a cancer-prone phenotype. The emerging tumors express low levels of Anx7 protein. Nonetheless, the wild-type Anx7 allele is detectable in laser-capture microdissection-derived tumor tissue cells. Genome array analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue indicates that the Anx7(+/-) genotype is accompanied by profound reductions of expression of several other tumor suppressor genes, DNA repair genes, and apoptosis-related genes. In situ analysis by tissue imprinting from chromosomes in the primary tumor and spectral karyotyping analysis of derived cell lines identify chromosomal instability and clonal chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, whereas 23% of the mutant mice develop spontaneous neoplasms, all mice exhibit growth anomalies, including gender-specific gigantism and organomegaly. We conclude that haploinsufficiency of Anx7 expression appears to drive disease progression to cancer because of genomic instability through a discrete signaling pathway involving other tumor suppressor genes, DNA-repair genes, and apoptosis-related genes.",

        "abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a multifunctional tumor suppressor, has been shown to play a regulatory role in cell migration. Dictyostelium discoideum cells lacking PTEN exhibited impaired migration toward chemoattractant gradients. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of PTEN in chemotaxis of mammalian cells by examining PTEN-null Jurkat T cells. We observed that, in contrast to observations made in D discoideum, PTEN-null Jurkat T cells exhibited potent chemotactic responses to the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha), indicating that PTEN was not requisite for CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated chemotaxis of Jurkat cells. Conversely, reconstitution of PTEN in Jurkat cells by using a tetracycline (Tet-on)-inducible expression system down-regulated CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. Furthermore, we established the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN as essential for its inhibitory effect on chemotaxis. In addition, using PTEN-expressing T-cell lines and primary T cells, we demonstrated that down-regulation of PTEN expression with vector-based small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enhanced CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. Based on these results, we conclude that PTEN expression negatively regulates chemotaxis of lymphoid mammalian cells via its lipid phosphatase activity. Our findings may account for the reported increase in metastatic activity of PTEN-null tumor cells.",

Here we use the Dictyostelium diploid system to replace the essential Arp2 protein with mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at Thr-235/6 and Tyr-200. We found that aggregation of the resulting mutant cells after starvation was substantially slowed with delayed early developmental gene expression and that chemotaxis toward a cAMP gradient was defective with loss of polarity and attenuated F-actin assembly. Chemotaxis toward cAMP was also diminished with reduced cell speed and directionality and shorter pseudopod lifetime when Arp2 phosphorylation mutant cells were allowed to develop longer to a responsive state similar to that of wild-type cells. However, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and chemotaxis under agar to folate in vegetative cells were only subtly affected in Arp2 phosphorylation mutants. Thus, phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine is important for a subset of the functions of the Arp2/3 complex, in particular an unexpected major role in regulating development.",

The yeast and slime mold DHPases were over-expressed, shown to contain two zinc ions, characterized for their properties and compared to those of the calf liver enzyme. In general, the kinetic parameters varied widely among the enzymes, the mammalian DHPase having the highest catalytic efficiency. The ring opening was catalyzed most efficiently at pH 8.0 and competitively inhibited by the reaction product, N-carbamyl-beta-alanine. At lower pH values DHPases catalyzed the reverse reaction, the closing of the ring. Apparently, eukaryote DHPases are enzymatically as well as phylogenetically related to the de novo biosynthetic dihydroorotase (DHOase) enzymes. Modeling studies showed that the position of the catalytically critical amino acid residues of bacterial DHOases and eukaryote DHPases overlap. Therefore, only a few modifications might have been necessary during evolution to convert the unspecialized enzyme into anabolic and catabolic ones.",

        "abstract": "Capping Protein (CP) plays a central role in the creation of the Arp2/3-generated branched actin networks comprising lamellipodia and pseudopodia by virtue of its ability to cap the actin filament barbed end, which promotes Arp2/3-dependent filament nucleation and optimal branching. The highly conserved protein V-1/Myotrophin binds CP tightly in vitro to render it incapable of binding the barbed end. Here we addressed the physiological significance of this CP antagonist in Dictyostelium, which expresses a V-1 homolog that we show is very similar biochemically to mouse V-1. Consistent with previous studies of CP knockdown, overexpression of V-1 in Dictyostelium reduced the size of pseudopodia and the cortical content of Arp2/3 and induced the formation of filopodia. Importantly, these effects scaled positively with the degree of V-1 overexpression and were not seen with a V-1 mutant that cannot bind CP. V-1 is present in molar excess over CP, suggesting that it suppresses CP activity in the cytoplasm at steady state. Consistently, cells devoid of V-1, like cells overexpressing CP described previously, exhibited a significant decrease in cellular F-actin content. Moreover, V-1-null cells exhibited pronounced defects in macropinocytosis and chemotactic aggregation that were rescued by V-1, but not by the V-1 mutant. Together, these observations demonstrate that V-1 exerts significant influence in vivo on major actin-based processes via its ability to sequester CP. Finally, we present evidence that V-1's ability to sequester CP is regulated by phosphorylation, suggesting that cells may manipulate the level of active CP to tune their \"actin phenotype.\"",

        "abstract": "O(2) regulates multicellular development of the social amoeba Dictyostelium, suggesting it may serve as an important cue in its native soil environment. Dictyostelium expresses an HIF\u03b1-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1) whose levels affect the O(2)-threshold for culmination implicating it as a direct O(2)-sensor, as in animals. But Dictyostelium lacks HIF\u03b1, a mediator of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling, and P4H1 can hydroxylate Pro143 of Skp1, a subunit of E3(SCF)ubiquitin-ligases. Skp1 hydroxyproline then becomes the target of five sequential glycosyltransferase reactions that modulate the O(2)-signal. Here we show that genetically induced changes in Skp1 levels also affect the O(2)-threshold, in opposite direction to that of the modification enzymes suggesting that the latter reduce Skp1 activity. Consistent with this, overexpressed Skp1 is poorly hydroxylated and Skp1 is the only P4H1 substrate detectable in extracts. Effects of Pro143 mutations, and of combinations of Skp1 and enzyme level perturbations, are consistent with pathway modulation of Skp1 activity. However, some effects were not mirrored by changes in modification of the bulk Skp1 pool, implicating a Skp1 subpopulation and possibly additional unknown factors. Altered Skp1 levels also affected other developmental transitions in a modification-dependent fashion. Whereas hydroxylation of animal HIF\u03b1 results in its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, Dictyostelium Skp1 levels were little affected by its modification status. These data indicate that Skp1 and possibly E3(SCF)ubiquitin-ligase activity modulate O(2)-dependent culmination and other developmental processes, and at least partially mediate the action of the hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in O(2)-sensing.",

PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, produced by PI3K, acts via diverse downstream signaling components, including the GTPase Rac, Arf-GTPases and the kinase Akt (PKB). It has become increasingly apparent, however, that chemotaxis results from an interplay between the PI3K-PTEN pathway and other parallel pathways in Dictyostelium and mammalian cells. In Dictyostelium, the phospholipase PLA2 acts in concert with PI3K to regulate chemotaxis, whereas phospholipase C (PLC) plays a supporting role in modulating PI3K activity. In adenocarcinoma cells, PLC and the actin regulator cofilin seem to provide the direction-sensing machinery, whereas PI3K might regulate motility.",

Although there have been a few attempts to study the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of these processes, most studies have focused on the dynamics extracted from single focal planes. However, the relation between the dynamics and 3D cell shape remains elusive because of the lack of signaling information about the unobserved part of the membrane. Here, we show that PtdInsP3 wave dynamics are directly regulated by the 3D geometry (i.e., size and shape) of the plasma membrane. By introducing an analysis method that extracts the 3D spatiotemporal activities on the entire cell membrane, we show that PtdInsP3 waves self-regulate their dynamics within the confined membrane area. This leads to changes in speed, orientation, and pattern evolution, following the underlying excitability of the signal transduction system. Our findings emphasize the role of the plasma membrane topology in reaction-diffusion-driven biological systems and indicate its importance in other mammalian systems.",

        "abstract": "Genome analyses of marine microbial communities have revealed the widespread occurrence of genomic islands (GIs), many of which encode for protein secretion machineries described in the context of bacteria-eukaryote interactions. Yet experimental support for the specific roles of such GIs in aquatic community interactions remains scarce. Here, we test for the contribution of type III secretion systems (T3SS) to the environmental fitness of epidemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Comparisons of V. parahaemolyticus wild types and T3SS-defective mutants demonstrate that the T3SS encoded on genome island VPaI-7 (T3SS-2) promotes survival of V. parahaemolyticus in the interaction with diverse protist taxa. Enhanced persistence was found to be due to T3SS-2 mediated cytotoxicity and facultative parasitism of V. parahaemolyticus on coexisting protists. Growth in the presence of bacterivorous protists and the T3SS-2 genotype showed a strong correlation across environmental and clinical isolates of V. parahaemolyticus. Short-term microcosm experiments provide evidence that protistan hosts facilitate the invasion of T3SS-2 positive V. parahaemolyticus into a coastal plankton community, and that water temperature and productivity further promote enhanced survival of T3SS-2 positive V. parahaemolyticus. This study is the first to describe the fitness advantage of GI-encoded functions in a microbial food web, which may provide a mechanistic explanation for the global spread and the seasonal dynamics of V. parahaemolyticus pathotypes, including the pandemic serotype cluster O3:K6, in aquatic environments.",

        "abstract": "Ongoing large-scale genome sequencing projects are forecasting a data deluge that will almost certainly overwhelm current analytical capabilities of evolutionary genomics. In contrast to population genomics, there are no standardized methods in evolutionary genomics for extracting evolutionary and functional (e.g. gene-trait association) signal from genomic data. Here, we examine how current practices of multi-species comparative genomics perform in this aspect and point out that many genomic datasets are under-utilized due to the lack of powerful methodologies. As a result, many current analyses emphasize gene families for which some functional data is already available, resulting in a growing gap between functionally well-characterized genes/organisms and the universe of unknowns. This leaves unknown genes on the 'dark side' of genomes, a problem that will not be mitigated by sequencing more and more genomes, unless we develop tools to infer functional hypotheses for unknown genes in a systematic manner. We provide an inventory of recently developed methods capable of predicting gene-gene and gene-trait associations based on comparative data, then argue that realizing the full potential of whole genome datasets requires the integration of phylogenetic comparative methods into genomics, a rich but underutilized toolbox for looking into the past.",

        "abstract": "We previously identified the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) as an effector of Ras for the control of directed cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. Recently, the Ras-mediated regulation of mTORC2 was found to be conserved in mammalian cells, and mTORC2 was shown to be an effector of oncogenic Ras. Interestingly, mTORC2 has been linked to cancer cell migration, and particularly in breast cancer. Here, we investigated the role of Ras in promoting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells through mTORC2. We observed that both Ras and mTORC2 promote the migration of different breast cancer cells and breast cancer cell models. Using HER2 and oncogenic Ras-transformed breast epithelial MCF10A cells, we found that both wild-type Ras and oncogenic Ras promote mTORC2 activation and an mTORC2-dependent migration and invasion in these breast cancer models. We further observed that, whereas oncogenic Ras-transformed MCF10A cells display uncontrolled cell proliferation and invasion, disruption of mTORC2 leads to loss of invasiveness only. Together, our findings suggest that, whereas the Ras-mediated activation of mTORC2 is expected to play a minor role in breast tumor formation, the Ras-mTORC2 pathway plays an important role in promoting the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.",

It triggers a spectrum of responses that cause bacteria to shift from a swarming motile phase to sessile biofilm formation. However, additional functions for c-di-GMP and roles for related molecules, such as c-di-AMP and c-AMP-GMP continue to be uncovered. The first usage of cyclic-di-nucleotide (c-di-NMP) signaling in the eukaryote domain emerged only recently. In dictyostelid social amoebas, c-di-GMP is a secreted signal that induces motile amoebas to differentiate into sessile stalk cells. In humans, c-di-NMPs, which are either produced endogenously in response to foreign DNA or by invading bacterial pathogens, trigger the innate immune system by activating the expression of interferon genes. STING, the human c-di-NMP receptor, is conserved throughout metazoa and their closest unicellular relatives, suggesting protist origins for human c-di-NMP signaling. Compared to the limited number of conserved protein domains that detect the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, the domains that detect the c-di-NMPs are surprisingly varied.",

        "abstract": "Cytoskeletal motors act as cargo transporters in cells and may be harnessed for directed transport applications in molecular detection and diagnostic devices. High processivity, the ability to take many steps along a track before dissociating, is often a desirable characteristic because it allows nanoscale motors to transport cargoes over distances on the scale of micrometres, in vivo and in vitro. Natural processive myosins are dimeric and use internal tension to coordinate the detachment cycles of the two heads. Here, we show that processivity can be enhanced in engineered myosins using two non-natural strategies designed to optimize the effectiveness of random, uncoordinated stepping: (1) the formation of three-headed and four-headed myosins and (2) the introduction of flexible elements between heads. We quantify improvements using systematic single-molecule characterization of a panel of engineered motors. To test the modularity of our approach, we design a controllably bidirectional myosin that is robustly processive in both forward and backward directions, and also produce the fastest processive cytoskeletal motor measured so far, reaching a speed of 10 \u00b5m s(-1).",

This apparatus is a redesigned stopped-flow which is capable of mixing the reactants on a submillisecond timescale concomitant with a temperature-jump even as large as 60 degrees C. We show that enzyme reactions that are faster than the denaturation process can be investigated above denaturation temperatures. In addition, the temperature-jump/stopped-flow enables us to investigate at physiological temperature the mechanisms of many human enzymes, which was impossible until now because of their heat instability. Furthermore, this technique is extremely useful in studying the progress of heat-induced protein unfolding. The temperature-jump/stopped-flow method combined with the application of structure-specific fluorescence signals provides novel opportunities to study the stability of certain regions of enzymes and identify the unfolding-initiating regions of proteins.

        "abstract": "Myosin VII (M7) and talin are ancient and ubiquitous actin-binding proteins with conserved roles in adhesion. Talin serves to link membrane receptors to the underlying actin cytoskeleton and forms a complex with M7 in Dictyostelium. The levels of talinA are tightly linked to M7 levels in Dictyostelium. Cells lacking M7 exhibit an 80% decrease in steady-state levels of talinA, whereas increased levels of M7 result in concomitant increases in total talinA. In contrast, changes in talinA levels do not affect M7 levels. Immunoprecipitation reveals that talinA and M7 are associated with each other in membrane fractions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments on green fluorescent protein (GFP)-M7 cells expressing different levels of the M7 and talinA show that changes in the overall amounts of these two proteins influences the dynamics of membrane-associated M7. The recovery of GFP-M7 on the membrane is faster in cells lacking talinA and limited in the presence of excess amounts of talinA and M7. These results establish that M7 stabilizes talinA in the cytosol and, in return, talinA regulates the residence time of M7 at the plasma membrane, suggesting that these two proteins are both part of the same dynamic adhesion complex on the plasma membrane.",

By optogenetically targeting different nodes in the Ras/PI3K/Akt network in differentiated human HL-60 neutrophils, we abruptly altered protrusive activity, bypassing the chemoattractant receptor/G-protein network. First, global recruitment of active KRas4B/HRas isoforms or a RasGEF, RasGRP4, immediately increased spreading and random motility. Second, activating Ras at the cell rear generated new protrusions, reversed pre-existing polarity, and steered sustained migration in neutrophils or murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Third, recruiting a RasGAP, RASAL3, to cell fronts extinguished protrusions and changed migration direction. Remarkably, persistent RASAL3 recruitment at stable fronts abrogated directed migration in three different chemoattractant gradients. Fourth, local recruitment of the Ras-mTORC2 effector, Akt, in neutrophils or Dictyostelium amoebae generated new protrusions and rearranged pre-existing polarity. Overall, these optogenetic effects were mTORC2-dependent but relatively independent of PI3K. Thus, receptor-independent, local activations of classical growth-control pathways directly control actin assembly, cell shape, and migration modes.",

Filopodia initiation requires a suite of conserved proteins but the mechanism remains poorly understood. The actin polymerase VASP and a MyTH-FERM (MF) myosin, DdMyo7 in amoeba, are essential for filopodia initiation. DdMyo7 is localized to dynamic regions of the actin-rich cortex. Analysis of VASP mutants and treatment of cells with anti-actin drugs shows that myosin recruitment and activation in <i>Dictyostelium</i> requires localized VASP-dependent actin polymerization. Targeting of DdMyo7 to the cortex alone is not sufficient for filopodia initiation; VASP activity is also required. The actin regulator locally produces a cortical actin network that activates myosin and together they shape the actin network to promote extension of parallel bundles of actin during filopodia formation. This work reveals how filopodia initiation requires close collaboration between an actin-binding protein, the state of the actin cytoskeleton and MF myosin activity.",

PI3K is thought to produce membrane lipid-binding sites for localization of PH domain-containing proteins. We demonstrate that in response to chemoattractants three PH domain-containing proteins do not localize to the leading edge in pi3k1/2-null cells, and the translocation is blocked in wild-type cells by LY294002. Cells lacking one of these proteins, phdA-null cells, exhibit defects in the level and kinetics of actin polymerization at the leading edge and have chemotaxis phenotypes that are distinct from those described previously for protein kinase B (PKB) (pkbA)-null cells. Phenotypes of PhdA-dominant interfering mutations suggest that PhdA is an adaptor protein that regulates F-actin localization in response to chemoattractants and links PI3K to the control of F-actin polymerization at the leading edge during pseudopod formation. We suggest that PKB and PhdA lie downstream from PI3K and control different downstream effector pathways that are essential for proper chemotaxis.",

Previously we found that the Dictyostelium ortholog of Lyst, LvsB, is a cytosolic protein that associates with lysosomes and post-lysosomes to prevent their inappropriate fusion. Here we provide three lines of evidence that indicate that LvsB contributes to lysosome function by antagonizing the function of DdRab14, a protein that promotes homotypic fusion among lysosomes. (1) Instead of restricting DdRab14 to lysosomes, cells that lack LvsB expand DdRab14 localization to include post-lysosomes. (2) Expression of activated DdRab14 phenocopies the loss of LvsB, causing inappropriate heterotypic fusion between lysosomes and post-lysosomes and their subsequent enlargement. (3) Conversely, expression of inactivated DdRab14 suppresses the phenotype of LvsB null cells and restores their lysosomal size and segregation from post-lysosomes. Our data suggest a scenario where LvsB binds to late lysosomes and promotes the inactivation of DdRab14. This inactivation allows the lysosomes to mature into post-lysosomes for eventual secretion. We propose that human Lyst may function similarly to regulate Rab-dependent fusion of lysosomal compartments.",

        "abstract": "Trace elements are used by all organisms and provide proteins with unique coordination and catalytic and electron transfer properties. Although many trace element-containing proteins are well characterized, little is known about the general trends in trace element utilization. We carried out comparative genomic analyses of copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt (in the form of vitamin B(12)), and selenium (in the form of selenocysteine) in 747 sequenced organisms at the following levels: (i) transporters and transport-related proteins, (ii) cofactor biosynthesis traits, and (iii) trace element-dependent proteins. Few organisms were found to utilize all five trace elements, whereas many symbionts, parasites, and yeasts used only one or none of these elements. Investigation of metalloproteomes and selenoproteomes revealed examples of increased utilization of proteins that use copper in land plants, cobalt in Dehalococcoides and Dictyostelium, and selenium in fish and algae, whereas nematodes were found to have great diversity of copper transporters. These analyses also characterized trace element metabolism in common model organisms and suggested new model organisms for experimental studies of individual trace elements. Mismatches in the occurrence of user proteins and corresponding transport systems revealed deficiencies in our understanding of trace element biology. Biological interactions among some trace elements were observed; however, such links were limited, and trace elements generally had unique utilization patterns. Finally, environmental factors, such as oxygen requirement and habitat, correlated with the utilization of certain trace elements. These data provide insights into the general features of utilization and evolution of trace elements in the three domains of life.",

Intensive farming and weather events, such as storms, flash flooding, and landslides, contribute estrogen to waterways used to supply drinking water. This paper explores the impact of estrogen exposure on the performance of slow sand filters (SSFs) used for water treatment. The feasibility and efficacy of SSF bioaugmentation with estrogen-degrading bacteria was also investigated, to determine whether removal of natural estrogens (estrone, estradiol, and estriol) and overall SSF performance for drinking water treatment could be improved. Strains for SSF augmentation were isolated from full-scale, municipal SSFs so as to optimize survival in the laboratory-scale SSFs used. Concentrations of the natural estrogens, determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealed augmented SSFs reduced the overall estrogenic potency of the supplied water by 25% on average and removed significantly more estrone and estradiol than nonaugmented filters. A negative correlation was found between coliform removal and estrogen concentration in nonaugmented filters. This was due to the toxic inhibition of protozoa, indicating that high estrogen concentrations can have functional implications for SSFs (such as impairing coliform removal). Consequently, we suggest that high estrogen concentrations could impact significantly on water quality production and, in particular, on pathogen removal in biological water filters.",

Here, capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is implemented to analyze complex mixtures of InsPs and PP-InsPs with high sensitivity. Stable isotope labeled (SIL) internal standards allow for matrix-independent quantitative assignment. The method is validated in wild-type and knockout mammalian cell lines and in model organisms. SIL-CE-ESI-MS enables the accurate monitoring of InsPs and PP-InsPs arising from compartmentalized cellular synthesis pathways, by feeding cells with either [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-myo-inositol or [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-D-glucose. In doing so, we provide evidence for the existence of unknown inositol synthesis pathways in mammals, highlighting the potential of this method to dissect inositol phosphate metabolism and signalling.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasensitivity, as described by Goldbeter and Koshland, has been considered for a long time as a way to realize bistable switches in biological systems. It is not as well recognized that when ultrasensitivity and reinforcing feedback loops are present in a spatially distributed system such as the cell plasmamembrane, they may induce bistability and spatial separation of the system into distinct signaling phases. Here we suggest that bistability of ultrasensitive signaling pathways in a diffusive environment provides a basic mechanism to realize cell membrane polarity. Cell membrane polarization is a fundamental process implicated in several basic biological phenomena, such as differentiation, proliferation, migration and morphogenesis of unicellular and multicellular organisms. We describe a simple, solvable model of cell membrane polarization based on the coupling of membrane diffusion with bistable enzymatic dynamics. The model can reproduce a broad range of symmetry-breaking events, such as those observed in eukaryotic directional sensing, the apico-basal polarization of epithelium cells, the polarization of budding and mating yeast, and the formation of Ras nanoclusters in several cell types.",

These repetitive sequences are prone to expansion or contraction, and when microsatellite expansion occurs in the regulatory or coding regions of genes this can result in a number of diseases including many neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike in humans and other organisms, the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> contains an unusually high number of microsatellites. Intriguingly, many of these microsatellites fall within the coding region of genes, resulting in nearly 10,000 homopolymeric repeat proteins within the <i>Dictyostelium</i> proteome. Surprisingly, among the most common of these repeats are polyglutamine repeats, a type of repeat that causes a class of nine neurodegenerative diseases in humans. In this minireview, we summarize what is currently known about homopolymeric repeats and microsatellites in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and discuss the potential utility of <i>Dictyostelium</i> for identifying novel mechanisms that utilize and regulate regions of repetitive DNA.",

        "abstract": "Dynein is a cytoskeletal molecular motor protein that moves along the microtubule (MT) and transports various cellular cargos during its movement. Using standard Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) methods, this investigation studied large-scale movements and local interactions of dynein's Microtubule Binding Domain (MTBD) when bound to tubulin heterodimer subunits. Examination of the interactions between the MTBD segments, and their adjustments in terms of intra- and intermolecular distances at the interfacial area with tubulin heterodimer, particularly at \u03b1-H16, \u03b2-H18, and \u03b2-tubulin C-terminal tail (CTT), was the main focus of this study. The specific intramolecular interactions, electrostatic forces, and the salt bridge residue pairs were shown to be the dominating factors in orchestrating movements of the MTBD and MT interfacial segments in the dynein's low-high-affinity binding modes. Important interactions included \u03b2-Glu447 and \u03b2-Glu449 (CTT) with Arg3469 (MTBD-H6), Lys3472 (MTBD-H6-H7 loop) and Lys3479 (MTBD-H7); \u03b2-Glu449 with Lys3384 (MTBD-H8), Lys3386 and His3387 (MTBD-H1). The structural and precise position, orientation, and functional effects of the CTTs on the MT-MTBD, within reasonable cut-off distance for non-bonding interactions and under physiological conditions, are unavailable from previous studies. The absence of the residues in the highly flexible MT-CTTs in the experimentally solved structures is perhaps in some cases due to insufficient data from density maps, but these segments are crucial in protein binding. The presented work contributes to the information useful for the MT-MTBD structure refinement.",

        "abstract": "The intrinsic chemical reaction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis catalyzed by myosin is modeled by using a combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methodology that achieves a near ab initio representation of the entire model. Starting with coordinates derived from the heavy atoms of the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1VOM) in which myosin is bound to the ATP analog ADP.VO(4)(-), a minimum-energy path is found for the transformation ATP + H(2)O --> ADP + P(i) that is characterized by two distinct events: (i) a low activation-energy cleavage of the P(gamma) O(betagamma) bond and separation of the gamma-phosphate from ADP and (ii) the formation of the inorganic phosphate as a consequence of proton transfers mediated by two water molecules and assisted by the Glu-459-Arg-238 salt bridge of the protein. The minimum-energy model of the enzyme-substrate complex features a stable hydrogen-bonding network in which the lytic water is positioned favorably for a nucleophilic attack of the ATP gamma-phosphate and for the transfer of a proton to stably bound second water. In addition, the P(gamma) O(betagamma) bond has become significantly longer than in the unbound state of the ATP and thus is predisposed to cleavage. The modeled transformation is viewed as the part of the overall hydrolysis reaction occurring in the closed enzyme pocket after ATP is bound tightly to myosin and before conformational changes preceding release of inorganic phosphate.",

Despite numerous differences in the adaptation mechanisms employed by bacteria and eukaryotes, all require energy consumption. Here, we present two minimal models showing that expenditure of energy by the cell is not essential for adaptation. Both models share important features with large eukaryotic cells: they employ small diffusible molecules and involve receptor subunits resembling highly conserved G-protein cascades. Analyzing the drawbacks of these models helps us understand the benefits of energy consumption, in terms of adjustability of response and adaptation times as well as separation of cell-external sensing and cell-internal signaling. Our work thus sheds new light on the evolution of adaptation mechanisms in complex systems.",

Arpin is activated by the small GTPase Rac, which controls cell protrusion, thus closing a negative feedback loop that renders the protrusion intrinsically unstable. Because of these properties, it was proposed that Arpin might play a role in directed migration, where directional persistence has to be fine-tuned. We report here, however, that Arpin-depleted tumour cells and Arpin knock-out Dictyostelium amoeba display no obvious defect in chemotaxis. These results do not rule out a potential role of Arpin in other systems, but argue against a general role of Arpin in chemotaxis.",

Host cell entry and the establishment of a replication niche are well understood, but little is known about how tubercular mycobacteria exit host cells and disseminate the infection. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium as a genetically tractable host for pathogenic mycobacteria, we discovered that M. tuberculosis and M. marinum, but not M. avium, are ejected from the cell through an actin-based structure, the ejectosome. This conserved nonlytic spreading mechanism requires a cytoskeleton regulator from the host and an intact mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system.

Here, we show that AP-1 is also localized to phagocytic cups in murine macrophages as well as in Dictyostelium amoebae. AP-1 is recruited to phagosomal membranes at this early stage of phagosome formation and rapidly dissociates from maturing phagosomes. To establish the role of AP-1 in phagocytosis, we made used of Dictyostelium mutant cells (apm1(-) cells) disrupted for AP-1 medium chain. In this mutant, phagocytosis drops by 60%, indicating that AP-1 is necessary for efficient phagocytosis. Furthermore, phagocytosis in apm1(-) cells is more affected for large rather than small particles, and cells exhibiting incomplete engulfment are then often observed. This suggests that AP-1 could participate in the extension of the phagocytic cup. Interestingly, macropinocytosis, a process dedicated to fluid-phase endocytosis and related to phagocytosis, is also impaired in apm1(-) cells. In summary, our data suggest a new role of AP-1 at an early stage of phagosome and macropinosome formation.",

PKA plays a critical role in Dictyostelium development but no CREB homologue has been identified in this system. Here we show that Dictyostelium utilizes a CREB-like protein, BzpF, to integrate PKA signaling during late development. bzpF(-) mutants produce compromised spores, which are extremely unstable and germination defective. Previously, we have found that BzpF binds the canonical CRE motif in vitro. In this paper, we determined the DNA binding specificity of BzpF using protein binding microarray (PBM) and showed that the motif with the highest specificity is a CRE-like sequence. BzpF is necessary to activate the transcription of at least 15 PKA-regulated, late-developmental target genes whose promoters contain BzpF binding motifs. BzpF is sufficient to activate two of these genes. The comparison of RNA sequencing data between wild type and bzpF(-) mutant revealed that the mutant fails to express 205 genes, many of which encode cellulose-binding and sugar-binding proteins. We propose that BzpF is a CREB-like transcription factor that regulates spore maturation and stability in a PKA-related manner.",

        "abstract": "Adaptation in signaling systems, during which the output returns to a fixed baseline after a change in the input, often involves negative feedback loops and plays a crucial role in eukaryotic chemotaxis. We determined the dynamical response to a uniform change in chemoattractant concentration of a eukaryotic chemotaxis pathway immediately downstream from G protein-coupled receptors. The response of an activated Ras showed near-perfect adaptation, leading us to attempt to fit the results using mathematical models for the two possible simple network topologies that can provide perfect adaptation. Only the incoherent feedforward network accurately described the experimental results. This analysis revealed that adaptation in this Ras pathway is achieved through the proportional activation of upstream components and not through negative feedback loops. Furthermore, these results are consistent with a local excitation, global inhibition mechanism for gradient sensing, possibly with a Ras guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein acting as a global inhibitor.",

Although the structure of dynein by itself has been characterized, its conformation in complex with microtubules is still unknown. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the interaction between dynein and microtubules. Most dynein molecules in the nucleotide-free state are bound to the microtubule in a defined conformation and orientation. A 3D image reconstruction revealed that dynein's head domain, formed by a ring-like arrangement of AAA+ domains, is located approximately 280 A away from the center of the microtubule. The order of the AAA+ domains in the ring was determined by using recombinant markers. Furthermore, a 3D helical image reconstruction of microtubules with a dynein's microtubule binding domain [dynein stalk (DS)] revealed that the stalk extends perpendicular to the microtubule. By combining the 3D maps of the dynein-microtubule and DS-microtubule complexes, we present a model for how dynein in the nucleotide-free state binds to microtubules and discuss models for dynein's power stroke.",

Cellular dynamics of cAMP have been investigated using a series of fluorescent indicators; however, their sensitivity was sub-optimal for detecting cAMP dynamics at a low concentration range, due to a low ligand affinity and/or poor dynamic range. Seeking an indicator with improved detection sensitivity, we performed insertion screening of circularly permuted mApple, a red fluorescent protein, into the cAMP-binding motif of PKA regulatory subunit I\u03b1 and developed an improved cAMP indicator named R-FlincA (Red Fluorescent indicator for cAMP). Its increased affinity (K<sub>d</sub>\u2009=\u20090.3 \u03bcM) and expanded dynamic range (860% at pH 7.2) allowed the detection of subtle changes in the cellular cAMP dynamics at sub-\u03bcM concentrations, which could not be easily observed with existing indicators. Increased detection sensitivity also strengthened the advantages of using R-FlincA as a red fluorescent indicator, as it permits a series of applications, including multi-channel/function imaging of multiple second messengers and combinatorial imaging with photo-manipulation. These results strongly suggest that R-FlincA is a promising tool that accelerates cAMP research by revealing unobserved cAMP dynamics at a low concentration range.",

IC(50) values are in the range from 1 to 5 \u03bcm for mammalian class-1 myosins and greater than 90 \u03bcm for class-2 and class-5 myosins, and no inhibition was observed with class-6 and class-7 myosins. We show that in mammalian cells, PClP selectively inhibits myosin-1c function. To elucidate the structural basis for PClP-induced allosteric coupling and isoform-specific differences in the inhibitory potency of the compound, we used a multifaceted approach combining direct functional, crystallographic, and in silico modeling studies. Our results indicate that allosteric inhibition by PClP is mediated by the combined effects of global changes in protein dynamics and direct communication between the catalytic and allosteric sites via a cascade of small conformational changes along a conserved communication pathway.",

Ingestion and killing of different bacteria have been shown to rely on largely different molecular mechanisms. One would thus expect that <i>D. discoideum</i> adapts its ingestion and killing machinery when encountering different bacteria. In this study, we investigated by RNA sequencing if and how <i>D. discoideum</i> amoebae respond to the presence of different bacteria by modifying their gene expression patterns. Each bacterial species analyzed induced a specific modification of the transcriptome. Bacteria such as <i>Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, or <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> induced a specific and different transcriptional response, while <i>Micrococcus luteus</i> did not trigger a significant gene regulation. Although folate has been proposed to be one of the key molecules secreted by bacteria and recognized by hunting amoebae, it elicited a very specific and restricted transcriptional signature, distinct from that triggered by any bacteria analyzed here. Our results indicate that <i>D. discoideum</i> amoebae respond in a highly specific, almost non-overlapping manner to different species of bacteria. We additionally identify specific sets of genes that can be used as reporters of the response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to different bacteria.",

Our previous studies with <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> as a model of cell motility have demonstrated that aerotaxis toward an oxygen-rich region occurs below 2% O<sub>2</sub>. However, while the aerotaxis of <i>Dictyostelium</i> seems to be an effective strategy to search for what is essential for survival, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still largely unclear. One hypothesis is that an oxygen concentration gradient generates a secondary oxidative stress gradient that would direct cell migration towards higher oxygen concentration. Such mechanism was inferred but not fully demonstrated to explain the aerotaxis of human tumor cells. Here, we investigated the role on aerotaxis of flavohemoglobins, proteins that can both act as potential oxygen sensors and modulators of nitric oxide and oxidative stress. The migratory behaviors of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells were observed under both self-generated and imposed oxygen gradients. Furthermore, their changes by chemicals generating or preventing oxidative stress were tested. The trajectories of the cells were then analyzed through time-lapse phase-contrast microscopic images. The results indicate that both oxidative and nitrosative stresses are not involved in the aerotaxis of <i>Dictyostelium</i> but cause cytotoxic effects that are enhanced upon hypoxia.",

        "abstract": "Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) functions both intracellularly as part of fatty acid metabolism and extracellularly as diazepam binding inhibitor, the precursor of endozepine peptides. Two of these peptides, ODN and TTN, bind to the GABA(A) receptor and modulate its sensitivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We have found that depolarization of mouse primary astrocytes induces the rapid release and processing of ACBP to the active peptides. We previously showed that ODN can trigger the rapid sporulation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium. Using this bioassay, we now show that astrocytes release the endozepine peptides within 10 min of exposure to the steroids cortisol, pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, or progesterone. ACBP lacks a signal sequence for secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway and its secretion is not affected by addition of brefeldin A, a well known inhibitor of the classical secretion pathway, suggesting that it follows an unconventional pathway for secretion. Moreover, induction of autophagy by addition of rapamycin also resulted in rapid release of ACBP indicating that this protein uses components of the autophagy pathway for secretion. Following secretion, ACBP is proteolytically cleaved to the active neuropeptides by protease activity on the surface of astrocytes. Neurosteroids, such as pregnenolone sulfate, were previously shown to modulate the excitatory/inhibitory balance in brain through increased release of glutamate and decreased release of GABA. These effects of steroids in neurons will be reinforced by the release of endozepines from astrocytes shown here, and suggest an orchestrated astrocyte-neuron cross-talk that can affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions.",

In this study, we show that genetic inactivation of <i>lrrkA</i> also causes a previously unnoticed phenotype: <i>lrrkA</i> KO cells exhibit enhanced phagocytosis and cell motility compared to parental cells. This phenotype is cell autonomous, is reversible upon re-expression of LrrkA, and is not due to an abnormal response to inhibitory quorum-sensing factors secreted by <i>D. discoideum</i> in its medium. In addition, folate increases motility in parental <i>D. discoideum</i> cells, but not in <i>lrrkA</i> KO cells, suggesting that LrrkA plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to folate. On the contrary, <i>lrrkA</i> KO cells regulate gene transcription in response to folate in a manner indistinguishable from parental cells. Overall, based on analysis of mutant phenotypes, we identify gene products that participate in the control of intracellular killing, cell motility, and gene transcription in response to folate. These observations reveal a mechanism by which <i>D. discoideum</i> encountering bacterially-secreted folate can migrate, engulf, and kill bacteria more efficiently.",

We find that amoebae and neutrophils, cells traditionally used to study cell migration on a solid surface, move toward a chemotactic source while suspended in solution. They can swim and do so with speeds similar to those on a solid substrate. Based on the surprisingly rapidly changing shape of amoebae as they swim and earlier theoretical schemes for how suspended microorganisms can migrate (Purcell EM (1977) Life at low Reynolds number. Am J Phys 45:3-11), we suggest the general features these cells use to gain traction with the medium. This motion requires either the movement of the cell's surface from the cell's front toward its rear or protrusions that move down the length of the elongated cell. Our results indicate that a solid substratum is not a prerequisite for these cells to produce a forward thrust during movement and suggest that crawling and swimming are similar processes, a comparison we think is helpful in understanding how cells migrate.",

We found that blebbistatin does not weaken the tight actin binding of myosin.ADP, but unexpectedly it induces lever priming, a process for which the gamma-phosphate of ATP (or its analog) had been thought necessary.

        "abstract": "Attractive and repulsive cell guidance is essential for animal life and important in disease. Cell migration toward attractants dominates studies [1-8], but migration away from repellents is important in biology yet relatively little studied [5, 9, 10]. It is widely held that cells initiate migration by protrusion of their front [11-15], yet this has not been explicitly tested for cell guidance because cell margin displacement at opposite ends of the cell has not been distinguished for any cue. We argue that protrusion of the front, retraction of the rear, or both together could in principle break cell symmetry and start migration in response to guidance cues [16]. Here, we find in the Dictyostelium model [6] that an attractant-cAMP-breaks symmetry by causing protrusion of the front of the cell, whereas its repellent analog-8CPT-breaks symmetry by causing retraction of the rear. Protrusion of the front of these cells in response to cAMP starts with local actin filament assembly, while the delayed retraction of the rear is independent of both myosin II polarization and of motor-based contractility. On the contrary, myosin II accumulates locally in the rear of the cell in response to 8CPT, anticipating retraction and required for it, while local actin assembly is delayed and couples to delayed protrusion at the front. These data reveal an important new concept in the understanding of cell guidance.",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotic cells regulate their mobility by external cues. Genetic studies have identified >100 components that participate in chemotaxis, which hinders the identification of the conceptual framework of how cells sense and respond to shallow chemical gradients. The activation of Ras occurs during basal locomotion and is an essential connector between receptor and cytoskeleton during chemotaxis. Using a sensitive assay for activated Ras, we show here that activation of Ras and F-actin forms two excitable systems that are coupled through mutual positive feedback and memory. This coupled excitable system leads to short-lived patches of activated Ras and associated F-actin that precede the extension of protrusions. In buffer, excitability starts frequently with Ras activation in the back/side of the cell or with F-actin in the front of the cell. In a shallow gradient of chemoattractant, local Ras activation triggers full excitation of Ras and subsequently F-actin at the side of the cell facing the chemoattractant, leading to directed pseudopod extension and chemotaxis. A computational model shows that the coupled excitable Ras/F-actin system forms the driving heart for the ordered-stochastic extension of pseudopods in buffer and for efficient directional extension of pseudopods in chemotactic gradients.",

        "abstract": "The steps leading to constitutive exocytosis are poorly understood. In <i>Dictyostelium</i> WASH complex mutants, exocytosis is blocked, so cells that take up fluorescent dextran from the medium retain it and remain fluorescent. Here, we establish a FACS-based method to select cells that retain fluorescent dextran, allowing identification of mutants with disrupted exocytosis. Screening a pool of random mutants identified members of the WASH complex, as expected, and multiple mutants in the conserved HEAT-repeat-containing protein Mroh1. In <i>mroh1</i> mutants, endosomes develop normally until the stage where lysosomes neutralize to postlysosomes, but thereafter the WASH complex is recycled inefficiently, and subsequent exocytosis is substantially delayed. Mroh1 protein localizes to lysosomes in mammalian and <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, it accumulates on lysosomes as they mature and is removed, together with the WASH complex, shortly before the postlysosomes are exocytosed. WASH-generated F-actin is required for correct subcellular localization; in WASH complex mutants, and immediately after latrunculin treatment, Mroh1 relocalizes from the cytoplasm to small vesicles. Thus, Mroh1 is involved in a late and hitherto undefined actin-dependent step in exocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Conserved Asp-11 of actin is a part of the nucleotide binding pocket, and its mutation to Gln is dominant lethal in yeast, whereas the mutation to Asn in human \u03b1-actin dominantly causes congenital myopathy. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of those dominant negative effects, we prepared Dictyostelium versions of D11N and D11Q mutant actins and characterized them in vitro. D11N and D11Q actins underwent salt-dependent reversible polymerization, although the resultant polymerization products contained small anomalous structures in addition to filaments of normal appearance. Both monomeric and polymeric D11Q actin released bound nucleotides more rapidly than the wild type, and intriguingly, both monomeric and polymeric D11Q actins hardly bound cofilin. The deficiency in cofilin binding can be explained by rapid exchange of bound nucleotide with ATP in solution, because cofilin does not bind ATP-bound actin. Copolymers of D11Q and wild type actins bound cofilin, but cofilin-induced depolymerization of the copolymers was slower than that of wild type filaments, which may presumably be the primary reason why this mutant actin is dominantly toxic in vivo. Purified D11N actin was unstable, which made its quantitative biochemical characterization difficult. However, monomeric D11N actin released nucleotides even faster than D11Q, and we speculate that D11N actin also exerts its toxic effects in vivo through a defective interaction with cofilin. We have recently found that two other dominant negative actin mutants are also defective in cofilin binding, and we propose that the defective cofilin binder is a major class of dominant negative actin mutants.",

Dictyostelium amoebas are stereotypical phagocytes that prey on diverse bacteria using both processes. However, as typical phagocytic receptors, such as complement receptors or Fc\u03b3 receptors, have not been found in Dictyostelium, it remains mysterious how these cells recognize bacteria. Here, we show that a single G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), folic acid receptor 1 (fAR1), simultaneously recognizes the chemoattractant folate and the phagocytic cue lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of bacterial surfaces. Cells lacking fAR1 or its cognate G-proteins are defective in chemotaxis toward folate and phagocytosis of Klebsiella aerogenes. Computational simulations combined with experiments show that responses associated with chemotaxis can also promote engulfment of particles coated with chemoattractants. Finally, the extracellular Venus-Flytrap (VFT) domain of fAR1 acts as the binding site for both folate and LPS. Thus, fAR1 represents a new member of the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and mediates signaling from both bacterial surfaces and diffusible chemoattractants to reorganize actin for chemotaxis and phagocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Interaction conditions can change the balance of cooperation and conflict in multicellular groups. After aggregating together, cells of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum may migrate as a group (known as a slug) to a new location. We consider this migration stage as an arena for social competition and conflict because the cells in the slug may not be from a genetically homogeneous population. In this study, we examined the interplay of two seemingly diametric actions, the solitary action of kin recognition and the collective action of slug migration in D. discoideum, to more fully understand the effects of social competition on fitness over the entire lifecycle. We compare slugs composed of either genetically homogenous or heterogeneous cells that have migrated or remained stationary in the social stage of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. After migration of chimeric slugs, we found that facultative cheating is reduced, where facultative cheating is defined as greater contribution to spore relative to stalk than found for that clone in the clonal state. In addition our results support previous findings that competitive interactions in chimeras diminish slug migration distance. Furthermore, fruiting bodies have shorter stalks after migration, even accounting for cell numbers at that time. Taken together, these results show that migration can alleviate the conflict of interests in heterogeneous slugs. It aligns their interest in finding a more advantageous place for dispersal, where shorter stalks suffice, which leads to a decrease in cheating behavior.",

First, we docked an actin trimer to prepowerstroke myosin then relaxed the complex by a 100-ns long unrestrained molecular dynamics. In the first few nanoseconds, actin binding induced an extra primed myosin state, i.e. the further priming of the myosin lever by 18\u00b0 coupled to a further closure of switch 2 loop. We demonstrated that actin induces the extra primed state of myosin specifically through the actin N terminus-activation loop interaction. The applied in silico methodology was validated by forming rigor structures that perfectly fitted into an experimentally determined EM map of the rigor actomyosin. Our results unveiled the role of actin in the powerstroke by presenting that actin moves the myosin lever to the extra primed state that leads to the effective lever swing.",

However, it is not known how INCENP localizes on the furrow or whether this localization is separable from that at the midbody. Here, we show that the association of Dictyostelium INCENP (DdINCENP) with the cortex of the cleavage furrow involves interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and depends on the presence of the kinesin-6-related protein Kif12. We found that Kif12 is found on the central spindle and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Kif12 is not required for the redistribution of DdINCENP from centromeres to the central spindle. However, in the absence of Kif12, DdINCENP fails to localize on the cleavage furrow. Domain analysis indicates that the N terminus of DdINCENP is necessary and sufficient for furrow localization and that it binds directly to the actin cytoskeleton. Our data suggest that INCENP moves from the central spindle to the furrow of a dividing cell by a Kif12-dependent pathway. Once INCENP reaches the equatorial cortex, it associates with the actin cytoskeleton where it then concentrates toward the end of cytokinesis.",

Each meal is a potential infection because some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to resist predation. To survive such a hostile environment, <i>D. discoideum</i> has in turn evolved efficient antimicrobial responses that are intertwined with phagocytosis and autophagy, its nutrient acquisition pathways. The core machinery and antimicrobial functions of these pathways are conserved in the mononuclear phagocytes of mammals, which mediate the initial, innate-immune response to infection. In this review, we discuss the advantages and relevance of <i>D. discoideum</i> as a model phagocyte to study cell-autonomous defenses. We cover the antimicrobial functions of phagocytosis and autophagy and describe the processes that create a microbicidal phagosome: acidification and delivery of lytic enzymes, generation of reactive oxygen species, and the regulation of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> availability. High concentrations of metals poison microbes while metal sequestration inhibits their metabolic activity. We also describe microbial interference with these defenses and highlight observations made first in <i>D. discoideum</i>. Finally, we discuss galectins, TNF receptor-associated factors, tripartite motif-containing proteins, and signal transducers and activators of transcription, microbial restriction factors initially characterized in mammalian phagocytes that have either homologs or functional analogs in <i>D. discoideum</i>.",

To reveal the force-induced conformational changes, or strains, within proteins in living cells, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent \"strain sensor,\" by combining the proximity imaging (PRIM) technique, which uses spectral changes of 2 GFP molecules that are in direct contact, and myosin-actin as a model system. The developed PRIM-based strain sensor module (PriSSM) consists of the tandem fusion of a normal and circularly permuted GFP. To apply strain to PriSSM, it was inserted between 2 motor domains of Dictyostelium myosin II. In the absence of strain, the 2 GFP moieties in PriSSM are in contact, whereas when the motor domains are bound to F-actin, PriSSM has a strained conformation, leading to the loss of contact and a concomitant spectral change. Using the sensor system, we found that the position of the lever arm in the rigor state was affected by mutations within the motor domain. Moreover, the sensor was used to visualize the interaction between myosin II and F-actin in Dictyostelium cells. In normal cells, myosin was largely detached from F-actin, whereas ATP depletion or hyperosmotic stress increased the fraction of myosin bound to F-actin. The PRIM-based strain sensor may provide a general approach for studying force-induced protein conformational changes in cells.",

L. pneumophila is able to replicate within macrophages and protozoa by establishing a replicative compartment in a process that requires the Icm/Dot type IVB secretion system. The signals and regulatory pathways required for Legionella infection and intracellular replication are poorly understood. Mutation of the rpoS gene, which encodes sigma(S), does not affect growth in rich medium but severely decreases L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication within protozoan hosts. To gain insight into the intracellular multiplication defect of an rpoS mutant, we examined its pattern of gene expression during exponential and postexponential growth. We found that sigma(S) affects distinct groups of genes that contribute to Legionella intracellular multiplication. We demonstrate that rpoS mutants have a functional Icm/Dot system yet are defective for the expression of many genes encoding Icm/Dot-translocated substrates. We also show that sigma(S) affects the transcription of the cpxR and pmrA genes, which encode two-component response regulators that directly affect the transcription of Icm/Dot substrates. Our characterization of the L. pneumophila small RNA csrB homologs, rsmY and rsmZ, introduces a link between sigma(S) and the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA. We analyzed the network of sigma(S)-controlled genes by mutational analysis of transcriptional regulators affected by sigma(S). One of these, encoding the L. pneumophila arginine repressor homolog gene, argR, is required for maximal intracellular growth in amoebae. These data show that sigma(S) is a key regulator of multiple pathways required for L. pneumophila intracellular multiplication.",

Surprisingly little is known about how membranes control the force from motors and how this may impact specific cellular functions. Here, we show that dynein motors physically cluster into microdomains on the membrane of a phagosome as it matures inside cells. Such geometrical reorganization allows many dyneins within a cluster to generate cooperative force on a single microtubule. This results in rapid directed transport of the phagosome toward microtubule minus ends, likely promoting phagolysosome fusion and pathogen degradation. We show that lipophosphoglycan, the major molecule implicated in immune evasion of Leishmania donovani, inhibits phagosome motion by disrupting the clustering and therefore the cooperative force generation of dynein. These findings appear relevant to several pathogens that prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion by targeting lipid microdomains on phagosomes.",

        "abstract": "Cullins (CULs) are a core component of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which regulate the degradation, function, and subcellular trafficking of proteins. CULs are post-translationally regulated through neddylation, a process that conjugates the ubiquitin-like modifier protein neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to target cullins, as well as non-cullin proteins. Counteracting neddylation is the deneddylase, COP9 signalosome (CSN), which removes NEDD8 from target proteins. Recent comparative genomics studies revealed that CRLs and the CSN are highly conserved in Amoebozoa. A well-studied representative of Amoebozoa, the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, has been used for close to 100\u2009years as a model organism for studying conserved cellular and developmental processes owing to its unique life cycle comprised of unicellular and multicellular phases. The organism is also recognized as an exceptional model system for studying cellular processes impacted by human diseases, including but not limited to, cancer and neurodegeneration. Recent work shows that the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), inhibits growth and multicellular development in <i>D. discoideum</i>, which supports previous work that revealed the cullin interactome in <i>D. discoideum</i> and the roles of cullins and the CSN in regulating cellular and developmental processes during the <i>D. discoideum</i> life cycle. Here, we review the roles of cullins, neddylation, and the CSN in <i>D. discoideum</i> to guide future work on using this biomedical model system to further explore the evolutionarily conserved functions of cullins and neddylation.",

The human pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is equipped with a large arsenal of immune-modulating factors, allowing it to either subvert the host immune response or to create permissive niches for its survival. Recently, we showed that one of the low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatases produced by <i>S. aureus</i>, PtpA, is secreted during growth. Here, we report that deletion of <i>ptpA</i> in <i>S. aureus</i> affects intramacrophage survival and infectivity. We also observed that PtpA is secreted during macrophage infection. Immunoprecipitation assays identified several host proteins as putative intracellular binding partners for PtpA, including coronin-1A, a cytoskeleton-associated protein that is implicated in a variety of cellular processes. Of note, we demonstrated that coronin-1A is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon <i>S. aureus</i> infection and that its phosphorylation profile is linked to PtpA expression. Our results confirm that PtpA has a critical role during infection as a bacterial effector protein that counteracts host defenses.",

Here we examined the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and the cytoskeleton in Dictyostelium discoideum. Using time-lapse analysis, we quantified mitochondrial fission, fusion, and motility in the presence of cytoskeleton disrupting pharmaceuticals and the absence of the potential mitochondria-cytoskeleton linker protein, CluA. Our results indicate that microtubules are essential for mitochondrial movement, as well as fission and fusion; actin plays a less significant role, perhaps selecting the mitochondria for transport. We also suggest that CluA is not a linker protein but plays an unidentified role in mitochondrial fission and fusion. The significance of our work is to gain further insight into the role the cytoskeleton plays in mitochondrial dynamics and function. By better understanding these processes we can better appreciate the underlying mitochondrial contributions to many neurological disorders characterized by altered mitochondrial dynamics, structure, and/or function.",

        "abstract": "We have used transient kinetics, nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and kinetics simulations to resolve a structural transition in the Dictyostelium myosin II relay helix during the actin-activated power stroke. The relay helix plays a critical role in force generation in myosin, coupling biochemical changes in the ATPase site with the force-transducing rotation of the myosin light-chain domain. Previous research in the absence of actin showed that ATP binding to myosin induces a dynamic equilibrium between a bent prepower stroke state of the relay helix and a straight postpower stroke state, which dominates in the absence of ATP or when ADP is bound. We now ask whether actin binding reverses this transition and if so, how this reversal is coordinated with actin-activated phosphate release. We labeled a Cys-lite Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain with donor and acceptor probes at two engineered Cys residues designed to detect relay helix bending. We then performed transient time-resolved FRET following stopped-flow mixing of actin with labeled myosin, preincubated with ATP. We determined the kinetics of actin-activated phosphate release, using fluorescent phosphate-binding protein. The results show that actin binding to the myosin.ADP.P complex straightens the relay helix before phosphate dissociation. This actin-activated relay helix straightening is reversible, but phosphate irreversibly dissociates from the postpower stroke state, preventing reversal of the power stroke. Thus, relay helix straightening gates phosphate dissociation, whereas phosphate dissociation provides the thermodynamic driving force underlying force production.",

The ultimate definition of the glycoproteome would be the identification of all the N-glycans attached to all the modified asparaginyl sites of all the proteins, but glycosylation heterogeneity makes this an unachievable goal. However, mass spectrometry in combination with other methods does have the power to deeply mine the N-glycome of Dictyostelium, and characterize glycan profiles at individual sites of glycoproteins. Recent studies from our laboratories using mass spectrometry-based methods have confirmed basic precepts of the N-glycome based on prior classical methods using radiotracer methods, and have extended the scope of glycan diversity and the distribution of glycan types across specific glycoprotein attachment sites. The protocols described here simplify studies of the N-glycome and -glycoproteome, which should prove useful for interpreting mutant phenotypes, conducting interstrain and interspecies comparisons, and investigating glycan functions in glycoproteins of interest.",

        "abstract": "Hosts and their associated microbes can enter into different relationships, which can range from mutualism, where both partners benefit, to exploitation, where one partner benefits at the expense of the other. Many host-microbe relationships have been presumed to be mutualistic, but frequently only benefits to the host, and not the microbial symbiont, have been considered. Here, we address this issue by looking at the effect of host association on the fitness of two facultative members of the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> microbiome (<i>Burkholderia agricolaris</i> and <i>Burkholderia hayleyella</i>). Using two indicators of bacterial fitness, growth rate and abundance, we determined the effect of <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> on <i>Burkholderia</i> fitness. In liquid culture, we found that <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> amoebas lowered the growth rate of both <i>Burkholderia</i> species. In soil microcosms, we tracked the abundance of <i>Burkholderia</i> grown with and without <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> over a month and found that <i>B.\u00a0hayleyella</i> had larger populations when associating with <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> while <i>B.\u00a0agricolaris</i> was not significantly affected. Overall, we find that both <i>B.\u00a0agricolaris</i> and <i>B.\u00a0hayleyella</i> pay a cost to associate with <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i>, but <i>B.\u00a0hayleyella</i> can also benefit under some conditions. Understanding how fitness varies in facultative symbionts will help us understand the persistence of host-symbiont relationships.",

Dynamin superfamily proteins (DSPs) are large GTPases, which promote membrane fission and fusion, as well as membrane-independent cellular processes. Accordingly, DSPs play crucial roles for vesicle biogenesis and transport, organelle homeostasis, cytokinesis and cell-autonomous immunity. Major progress has been made over the last years in elucidating the function and structure of mammalian DSPs. <i>D. discoideum</i> produces at least eight DSPs, which are involved in membrane dynamics and other processes. The function and structure of these large GTPases has not been fully explored, despite the elaborate genetic and cell biological tools available for <i>D. discoideum</i>. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge about mammalian and <i>D. discoideum</i> DSPs, and we advocate the use of the genetically tractable amoeba to further study the role of DSPs in cell and infection biology. Particular emphasis is put on the virulence mechanisms of the facultative intracellular bacterium <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>.",

To examine if myosin II turns over in contractile rings, fluorescence of GFP-myosin II expressed in Dictyostelium cells was bleached locally by laser illumination, and the recovery was monitored. The fluorescence recovered with a half time of 7.01 +/- 2.62 s. This recovery was not caused by lateral movement of myosin II from the nonbleached area, but by an exchange with endoplasmic myosin II. Similar experiments were performed in cells expressing GFP-3ALA myosin II, of which three phosphorylatable threonine residues were replaced with alanine residues. In this case, recovery was not detected within a comparable time range. These results indicate that myosin II in the contractile ring performs dynamic turnover via its heavy chain phosphorylation. Because GFP-3ALA myosin II did not show the recovery, it served as a useful marker of myosin II movement, which enabled us to demonstrate cortical flow of myosin II toward the equator for the first time. Thus, cortical flow accompanies the dynamic exchange of myosin II during the formation of contractile rings.",

        "abstract": "Cellular chemotaxis has been the subject of a variety of studies due to its relevance in physiological processes, disease pathogenesis, and systems biology, among others. The migration of cells towards a chemical source remains a closely studied topic, with the Boyden chamber being one of the earlier techniques that has successfully studied cell chemotaxis. Despite its success, diffusion chambers such as these presented a number of problems, such as the quantification of many aspects of cell behaviour, the reproducibility of procedures, and measurement accuracy. The advent of microfluidic technology prompted more advanced studies of cell chemotaxis, usually involving the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> (<i>D. discoideum</i>) as a model organism because of its tendency to aggregate towards chemotactic agents and its similarities to higher eukaryotes. Microfluidic technology has made it possible for studies to look at chemotactic properties that would have been difficult to observe using classic diffusion chambers. Its flexibility and its ability to generate consistent concentration gradients remain some of its defining aspects, which will surely lead to an even better understanding of cell migratory behaviour and therefore many of its related biological processes. This paper first dives into a brief introduction of <i>D. discoideum</i> as a social organism and classical chemotaxis studies. It then moves to discuss early microfluidic devices, before diving into more recent and advanced microfluidic devices and their use with <i>D. discoideum</i>. The paper then closes with brief opinions about research progress in the field and where it will possibly lead in the future.",

For this purpose, we used a Dictyostelium G680V mutant myosin II whose release rates of Pi and ADP were highly suppressed relative to normal myosin, leading to a significantly extended life-time of the strongly bound state with actin and virtually no motility. When the mixing ratio of G680V mutant myosin II to skeletal muscle HMM (heavy myosin) was 0.01%, the actin filaments moved intermittently. When they moved, their sliding velocities were about two-fold faster than the velocity of skeletal HMM alone. Furthermore, sliding movements were also faster when the actin filaments were allowed to slide on skeletal muscle HMM-coated glass surfaces in the motility buffer solution containing G680V HMM. In this case no intermittent movement was observed. When the actin filaments used were copolymerized with a fusion protein consisting of Dictyostelium actin and Dictyostelium G680V myosin II motor domain, similar faster sliding movements were observed on skeletal muscle HMM-coated surfaces. The filament sliding velocities were about two-fold greater than the velocities of normal actin filaments. We found that the velocity of actin filaments sliding on skeletal muscle myosin molecules increased in the presence of a non-motile G680V mutant myosin motor.",

        "abstract": "Transposable elements, identified in all eukaryotes, are mobile genetic units that can change their genomic position. Transposons usually employ an excision and reintegration mechanism, by which they change position, but not copy number. In contrast, retrotransposons amplify via RNA intermediates, increasing their genomic copy number. Hence, they represent a particular threat to the structural and informational integrity of the invaded genome. The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, model organism of the evolutionary Amoebozoa supergroup, features a haploid, gene-dense genome that offers limited space for damage-free transposition. Several of its contemporary retrotransposons display intrinsic integration preferences, for example by inserting next to transfer RNA genes or other retroelements. Likely, any retrotransposons that invaded the genome of the amoeba in a non-directed manner were lost during evolution, as this would result in decreased fitness of the organism. Thus, the positional preference of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> retroelements might represent a domestication of the selfish elements. Likewise, the reduced danger of such domesticated transposable elements led to their accumulation, and they represent about 10% of the current genome of <i>D. discoideum</i>. To prevent the uncontrolled spreading of retrotransposons, the amoeba employs control mechanisms including RNA interference and heterochromatization. Here, we review TRE5-A, DIRS-1 and Skipper-1, as representatives of the three retrotransposon classes in <i>D. discoideum</i>, which make up 5.7% of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> genome. We compile open questions with respect to their mobility and cellular regulation, and suggest strategies, how these questions might be addressed experimentally.",

        "abstract": "Myosin heavy-chain kinase A (MHCK A) catalyses the disassembly of myosin II filaments in Dictyostelium cells via myosin II heavy-chain phosphorylation. MHCK A possesses a 'coiled-coil'-enriched domain that mediates the oligomerization, cellular localization and actin-binding activities of the kinase. F-actin (filamentous actin) binding by the coiled-coil domain leads to a 40-fold increase in MHCK A activity. In the present study we examined the actin-binding characteristics of the coiled-coil domain as a means of identifying mechanisms by which MHCK A-mediated disassembly of myosin II filaments can be regulated in the cell. Co-sedimentation assays revealed that the coiled-coil domain of MHCK A binds co-operatively to F-actin with an apparent K(D) of approx. 0.5 muM and a stoichiometry of approx. 5:1 [actin/C(1-498)]. Further analyses indicate that the coiled-coil domain binds along the length of the actin filament and possesses at least two actin-binding regions. Quite surprisingly, we found that the coiled-coil domain cross-links actin filaments into bundles, indicating that MHCK A can affect the cytoskeleton in two important ways: (1) by driving myosin II-filament disassembly via myosin II heavy-chain phosphorylation, and (2) by cross-linking/bundling actin filaments. This discovery, along with other supporting data, suggests a model in which MHCK A-mediated bundling of actin filaments plays a central role in the recruitment and activation of the kinase at specific sites in the cell. Ultimately this provides a means for achieving the robust and highly localized disruption of myosin II filaments that facilitates polarized changes in cell shape during processes such as chemotaxis, cytokinesis and multicellular development.",

It enables us to address the question of whether the purified phospholipid SLB membrane, including lipids related to amoeba locomotion, which was discussed in many previous studies, exhibits membrane deformation in the presence of cytosol extracted from amoeba; Methods: In this report, a method for reconstituting a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) membrane, composed of purified phospholipids and cytosol extracted from <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, is described. This technique is a new reconstitution method combining the artificial constitution of membranes with the reconstitution using animate cytosol (without precise purification at a molecular level), contributing to membrane deformation analysis; Results: The morphology transition of a SLB membrane composed of phosphatidylcholines, after the addition of cytosolic extract, was traced using a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope. As a result, pore formation in the SLB membrane was observed and phosphatidylinositides incorporated into the SLB membrane tended to suppress pore formation and expansion; Conclusions: The current findings imply that phosphatidylinositides have the potential to control cytoplasm activity and bind to a phosphoinositide-containing SLB membrane.",

While the CK biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways are the most well-understood in plant systems, these molecules have been identified in all kingdoms of life. This review follows the recent discovery of an expanded CK profile in the social amoeba, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. A comprehensive review on the present knowledge of CK biosynthesis, signal transduction, and CK-small molecule interactions within members of Dictyostelia will be summarized. In doing so, the utility of social amoebae will be highlighted as a model system for studying the evolution of these hormone-like signaling agents, which will set the stage for future research in this area.",

In contrast, research using <i>D. discoideum</i> as a host model for fungi is rare. We describe a comprehensive study, which uses <i>D. discoideum</i> as a host model system to investigate the interaction with apathogenic (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) and pathogenic (<i>Candida</i> sp.) yeast. We show that <i>Dictyostelium</i> can be co-cultivated with yeasts on solid media, offering a convenient test to study the interaction between fungi and phagocytes. We demonstrate that a number of <i>D. discoideum</i> mutants increase (<i>atg1</i><sup>-</sup>, <i>kil1</i><sup>-</sup>, <i>kil2</i><sup>-</sup>) or decrease (<i>atg6</i><sup>-</sup>) the ability of the amoebae to predate yeast cells. On the yeast side, growth characteristics, reduced phagocytosis rate, as well as known virulence factors of <i>C. albicans</i> (<i>EFG1, CPH1, HGC1, ICL1</i>) contribute to the resistance of yeast cells against predation by the amoebae. Investigating haploid <i>C. albicans</i> strains, we suggest using the amoebae plate test for screening purposes after random mutagenesis. Finally, we discuss the potential of our adapted amoebae plate test to use <i>D. discoideum</i> for risk assessment of yeast strains.",

        "abstract": "The path of moving eukaryotic cells depends on the kinetics and direction of extending pseudopods. Amoeboid cells constantly change their shape with pseudopods extending in different directions. Detailed analysis has revealed that time, place and direction of pseudopod extension are not random, but highly ordered with strong prevalence for only one extending pseudopod, with defined life-times, and with reoccurring events in time and space indicative of memory. Important components are Ras activation and the formation of branched F-actin in the extending pseudopod and inhibition of pseudopod formation in the contractile cortex of parallel F-actin/myosin. In biology, order very often comes with symmetry. In this essay, I discuss cell movement and the dynamics of pseudopod extension from the perspective of symmetry and symmetry changes of Ras activation and the formation of branched F-actin in the extending pseudopod. Combining symmetry of Ras activation with kinetics and memory of pseudopod extension results in a refined model of amoeboid movement that appears to be largely conserved in the fast moving <i>Dictyostelium</i> and neutrophils, the slow moving mesenchymal stem cells and the fungus <i>B.d. chytrid</i>.",

During macropinosome formation, bulk plasma membrane is internalized with all its integral proteins. It is vital for cells to salvage these proteins before degradation, but the mechanisms for sorting them are not known. Here we describe the evolutionarily conserved recruitment of the WASH (WASP and SCAR homolog) complex to both macropinosomes and phagosomes within a minute of internalization. Using Dictyostelium, we demonstrate that WASH drives protein sorting and recycling from macropinosomes and is thus essential to maintain surface receptor levels and sustain phagocytosis. WASH functionally interacts with the retromer complex at both early and late phases of macropinosome maturation, but mediates recycling via retromer-dependent and -independent pathways. WASH mutants consequently have decreased membrane levels of integrins and other surface proteins. This study reveals an important pathway enabling cells to sustain macropinocytosis without bulk degradation of plasma membrane components.",

Nevertheless, the recurrent isolation of strains from clinical human cases could indicate the emergence of novel strains originating from the rhizosphere reservoir, which could be particularly resistant to the immune system and clinical treatment. The importance of type three secretion systems (T3SSs) in the related Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial species and the occurrence of this secretion system in plant-associated P. fluorescens raise the question of whether clinical isolates may also harbor T3SSs. In this study, isolates associated with clinical infections and identified in hospitals as belonging to P. fluorescens were compared with fluorescent pseudomonads harboring T3SSs isolated from plants. Bacterial isolates were tested for (i) their genetic relationships based on their 16S rRNA phylogeny, (ii) the presence of T3SS genes by PCR, and (iii) their infectious potential on animals and plants under environmental or physiological temperature conditions. Two groups of bacteria were delineated among the clinical isolates. The first group encompassed thermotolerant (41\u00b0C) isolates from patients suffering from blood infections; these isolates were finally found to not belong to P. fluorescens but were closely related and harbored highly conserved T3SS genes belonging to the Ysc-T3SS family, like the T3SSs from P. aeruginosa.

In <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> amoebae and macrophages, the ER tubule-resident large GTPase Sey1/atlastin3 (Atl3) accumulates on LCVs and promotes LCV expansion and intracellular replication of <i>L. pneumophila</i>. Fluorescence microscopy of <i>D. discoideum</i> infected with <i>L. pneumophila</i> indicated that Sey1 is involved in extensive ER remodeling around LCVs. An ultrastructural analysis confirmed these findings. Moreover, dominant negative Sey1_K154A compromises ER accumulation on LCVs and causes an aberrant ER morphology in uninfected <i>D. discoideum</i> as well as in amoebae infected with avirulent <i>L. pneumophila</i> that lack a functional type IV secretion system.

        "abstract": "Genes encoding type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are widely distributed in pathogenic Gram-negative bacterial species. In Vibrio cholerae, T6SS have been found to secrete three related proteins extracellularly, VgrG-1, VgrG-2, and VgrG-3. VgrG-1 can covalently cross-link actin in vitro, and this activity was used to demonstrate that V. cholerae can translocate VgrG-1 into macrophages by a T6SS-dependent mechanism. Protein structure search algorithms predict that VgrG-related proteins likely assemble into a trimeric complex that is analogous to that formed by the two trimeric proteins gp27 and gp5 that make up the baseplate \"tail spike\" of Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4. VgrG-1 was shown to interact with itself, VgrG-2, and VgrG-3, suggesting that such a complex does form. Because the phage tail spike protein complex acts as a membrane-penetrating structure as well as a conduit for the passage of DNA into phage-infected cells, we propose that the VgrG components of the T6SS apparatus may assemble a \"cell-puncturing device\" analogous to phage tail spikes to deliver effector protein domains through membranes of target host cells.",

Armadillo-repeat-containing proteins also exist in plants, but the majority have unknown roles. The Arabidopsis genes that show greatest sequence homology to Armadillo/beta-catenin are called ARABIDILLO-1 and -2. Here, we demonstrate that ARABIDILLO-1 and -2 promote lateral root development. arabidillo-1/-2 mutants form fewer lateral roots, and ARABIDILLO-1-overexpressing lines produce more lateral roots than wild-type seedlings. ARABIDILLO-yellow fluorescent protein fusions are nuclear. ARABIDILLO proteins contain an F-box motif, and thus may target other proteins for proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of ARABIDILLO-1 protein fragments, including F-box fragments, in wild-type seedlings reduces lateral root formation to the level of the arabidillo-1/-2 mutant. We have shown that plant beta-catenin-related proteins regulate root development. We suggest that ARABIDILLO proteins may target an inhibitor of lateral root development for degradation and propose that Arabidopsis beta-catenin-related proteins define a previously uncharacterized pathway that promotes root branching.",

        "abstract": "Pantoea is a versatile genus of bacteria with both plant- and animal-pathogenic strains, some of which have been suggested to cause human infections. There is, however, limited knowledge on the potential determinants used for host association and pathogenesis in animal systems. In this study, we used the model host Dictyostelium discoideum to show that isolates of Pantoea\u00a0ananatis exhibit differential grazing susceptibility, with some being resistant to grazing by the amoebae. We carried out a high-throughput genetic screen of one grazing-resistant isolate, P.\u00a0ananatis BRT175, using the D.\u00a0discoideum pathosystem to identify genes responsible for the resistance phenotype. Among the 26 candidate genes involved in grazing resistance, we identified rhlA and rhlB, which we show are involved in the biosynthesis of a biosurfactant that enables swarming motility in P.\u00a0ananatis BRT175. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the biosurfactant was shown to be a glycolipid with monohexose-C10-C10 as the primary congener. We show that this novel glycolipid biosurfactant is cytotoxic to the amoebae and is capable of compromising cellular integrity, leading to cell lysis. The production of this biosurfactant may be important for bacterial survival in the environment and could contribute to the establishment of opportunistic infections. IMPORTANCE The genetic factors used for host interaction by the opportunistic human pathogen Pantoea ananatis are largely unknown. We identified two genes that are important for the production of a biosurfactant that confers grazing resistance against the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We show that the biosurfactant, which exhibits cytotoxicity toward the amoebae, is a glycolipid that incorporates a hexose rather than rhamnose. The production of this biosurfactant may confer a competitive advantage in the environment and could potentially contribute to the establishment of opportunistic infections.",

The fluorescence decreased during the temperature rise. Under some conditions, this decrease was followed by an increase, reflecting structural transitions within the protein. With adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (p[NH]ppA) or with ADP and BeF(x) bound, this rise was very rapid (reciprocal time constant approx. 2000 s(-1)) and varied only slightly with starting temperature, suggesting that, with these ligands, two different protein conformations were present in rapid equilibrium over a large temperature range. In the presence of ATP, the transient included several relaxation processes. Overall, the results suggest that complexes of S1 with ATP or with a number of other ligands exist as a mixture of two forms in temperature-dependent equilibrium. The results throw light on the finding of different forms of S1 in recent crystallographic studies and indicate a surprising lack of strong coupling between myosin's structural state and the nature of the nucleotide bound.",

Measuring these context-dependent effects in hosts and symbionts is critical to determining the nature of symbiotic interactions. We investigated context dependence in the symbiosis between social amoeba hosts and their inedible <i>Paraburkholderia</i> bacterial symbionts, where the context is the abundance of host food bacteria. <i>Paraburkholderia</i> have been shown to harm hosts dispersed to food-rich environments, but aid hosts dispersed to food-poor environments by allowing hosts to carry food bacteria. Through measuring symbiont density and host spore production, we show that this food context matters in three other ways. First, it matters for symbionts, who suffer a greater cost from competition with food bacteria in the food-rich context. Second, it matters for host-symbiont conflict, changing how symbiont density negatively impacts host spore production. Third, data-based simulations show that symbiosis often provides a long-term fitness advantage for hosts after rounds of growth and dispersal in variable food contexts, especially when conditions are harsh with little food. These results show how food context can have many consequences for the <i>Dictyostelium</i>-<i>Paraburkholderia</i> symbiosis and that both sides can frequently benefit.",

        "abstract": "AmpA is a secreted 24Kd protein that has pleiotropic effects on Dictyostelium development. Null mutants delay development at the mound stage with cells adhering too tightly to the substrate. Prestalk cells initially specify as prespore cells and are delayed in their migration to the mound apex. Extracellular AmpA can rescue these defects, but AmpA is also necessary in a cell autonomous manner for anterior like cells (ALCs) to migrate to the upper cup. The ALCs are only 10% of the developing cell population making it difficult to study the cell autonomous effect of AmpA on the migration of these cells. AmpA is also expressed in growing cells, but, while it contains a hydrophobic leader sequence that is cleaved, it is not secreted from growing cells. This makes growing cells an attractive system for studying the cell autonomous function of AmpA.",

To better predict cell activity data, we then used a combinatorial descriptor search in which pIC(50)(cell) = a pIC(50)(enzyme) + bB + cC + d, where B and C are descriptors (such as SlogP), and a-d are coefficients. R(2) increased from 0.01 to 0.74 (for a leave-two-out test set of 26 predictions). The method was then further validated using data for nine other systems, including bacterial, viral, and mammalian cell systems. On average, experimental/predicted cell pIC(50) correlations increased from R(2) = 0.28 (for an enzyme-only test set) to 0.70 (for enzyme plus two descriptor test set predictions), while predictions based on scrambled cell activity had no predictive value (R(2) = 0.13). These results are of interest since they represent a general way to predict cell from enzyme inhibition data, with in three cases, R(2) values increasing from approximately 0.02 to 0.72.",

        "abstract": "We present a structurally dynamic model for nucleotide- and actin-induced closure of the actin-binding cleft of myosin, based on site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in Dictyostelium myosin II. The actin-binding cleft is a solvent-filled cavity that extends to the nucleotide-binding pocket and has been predicted to close upon strong actin binding. Single-cysteine labeling sites were engineered to probe mobility and accessibility within the cleft. Addition of ADP and vanadate, which traps the posthydrolysis biochemical state, influenced probe mobility and accessibility slightly, whereas actin binding caused more dramatic changes in accessibility, consistent with cleft closure. We engineered five pairs of cysteine labeling sites to straddle the cleft, each pair having one label on the upper 50-kDa domain and one on the lower 50-kDa domain. Distances between spin-labeled sites were determined from the resulting spin-spin interactions, as measured by continuous wave EPR for distances of 0.7-2 nm or pulsed EPR (double electron-electron resonance) for distances of 1.7-6 nm. Because of the high distance resolution of EPR, at least two distinct structural states of the cleft were resolved. Each of the biochemical states tested (prehydrolysis, posthydrolysis, and rigor), reflects a mixture of these structural states, indicating that the coupling between biochemical and structural states is not rigid. The resulting model is much more dynamic than previously envisioned, with both open and closed conformations of the cleft interconverting, even in the rigor actomyosin complex.",

        "abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in cancers. PTEN has a central role in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling and converts PIP3 to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane. Despite its importance, the mechanism that mediates membrane localization of PTEN is poorly understood. Here, we generated a library that contains green fluorescent protein fused to randomly mutated human PTEN and expressed the library in Dictyostelium cells. Using live cell imaging, we identified mutations that enhance the association of PTEN with the plasma membrane. These mutations were located in four separate regions, including the phosphatase catalytic site, the calcium-binding region 3 (CBR3) loop, the C\u03b12 loop and the C-terminal tail phosphorylation site. The phosphatase catalytic site, the CBR3 loop and the C\u03b12 loop formed the membrane-binding regulatory interface and interacted with the inhibitory phosphorylated C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that membrane recruitment of PTEN is required for PTEN function in cells. Thus, heterologous expression system in Dictyostelium cells provides mechanistic and functional insight into membrane localization of PTEN.",

        "abstract": "Myosin-II thick filament formation in Dictyostelium is an excellent system for investigating the phenomenon of self-assembly, as the myosin molecule itself contains all the information required to form a structure of defined size. Phosphorylation of only three threonine residues can dramatically change the assembly state of myosin-II. We show here that the C-terminal 68 kDa of the myosin-II tail (termed AD-Cterm) assembles in a regulated manner similar to full-length myosin-II and forms bipolar thick filament (BTF) structures when a green fluorescent protein (GFP) \"head\" is added to the N terminus. The localization of this GFP-AD-Cterm to the cleavage furrow of dividing Dictyostelium cells depends on assembly state, similar to full-length myosin-II. This tail fragment therefore represents a good model system for the regulated formation and localization of BTFs. By reducing regulated BTF assembly to a more manageable model system, we were able to explore determinants of myosin-II self-assembly. Our data support a model in which a globular head limits the size of a BTF, and the large-scale charge character of the AD-Cterm region is important for BTF formation. Truncation analysis of AD-Cterm tail fragments shows that assembly is delicately balanced, resulting in assembled myosin-II molecules that are poised to disassemble due to the phosphorylation of only three threonines.",

To investigate the activity of DIF-like molecules in tumor cells, we recently synthesized a green fluorescent DIF-3 derivative, BODIPY-DIF-3G, and analyzed its bioactivity and cellular localization. In this study, we synthesized a red (orange) fluorescent DIF-3 derivative, BODIPY-DIF-3R, and compared the cellular localization and bioactivities of the two BODIPY-DIF-3s in HeLa human cervical cancer cells. Both fluorescent compounds penetrated the extracellular membrane within 0.5&emsp14;h and localized mainly to the mitochondria. In formalin-fixed cells, the two BODIPY-DIF-3s also localized to the mitochondria, indicating that the BODIPY-DIF-3s were incorporated into mitochondria independently of the mitochondrial membrane potential. After treatment for 3 days, BODIPY-DIF-3G, but not BODIPY-DIF-3R, induced mitochondrial swelling and suppressed cell proliferation. Interestingly, the swollen mitochondria were stainable with BODIPY-DIF-3G but not with BODIPY-DIF-3R. When added to isolated mitochondria in vitro, BODIPY-DIF-3G increased dose-dependently the rate of O2 consumption, but BODIPY-DIF-3R did not. These results suggest that the bioactive BODIPY-DIF-3G suppresses cell proliferation, at least in part, by altering mitochondrial activity, whereas the non-bioactive BODIPY-DIF-3R localizes to the mitochondria but does not affect mitochondrial activity or cell proliferation.",

As a platform for slug migration we use microscale confinements, which consist of intersecting microchannels fabricated from solidified agar-water solution. The agar surface provides necessary moisture to the slugs during the experiment while remaining sufficiently stiff to allow effective slug migration. The movements of the slugs in the microchannels are driven and guided by phototaxis via controlling light transmitted through optical fibers. The microchannels impose geometrical confinements on the migrating slugs, improving the spatial precision of the migration. We demonstrate that slugs that form in a microchamber can be driven to migrate through the microchannels, as well as steered to a particular direction at microchannel intersections. Our experimental results indicate that slug movements can be more effectively controlled in microchannels, and potentially useful for bio-actuation applications.",

        "abstract": "HTRA2 is a mitochondrial protein, mutations in which are associated with autosomal dominant late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). The mechanisms by which HTRA2 mutations result in PD are poorly understood. HTRA2 is proposed to play a proteolytic role in protein quality control and homeostasis in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Its loss has been reported to result in accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins. However, in at least one case, PD-associated HTRA2 mutation can cause its hyperphosphorylation, possibly resulting in protease hyperactivity. The consequences of overactive mitochondrial HTRA2 are not clear. <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> provides a well-established model for studying mitochondrial dysfunction, such as has been implicated in the pathology of PD. We identified a single homologue of human HTRA2 encoded in the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> genome and showed that it is localized to the mitochondria where it plays a cytoprotective role. Knockdown of HTRA2 expression caused defective morphogenesis in the multicellular phases of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> life cycle. In vegetative cells, it did not impair mitochondrial respiration but nonetheless caused slow growth (particularly when the cells were utilizing a bacterial food source), unaccompanied by significant defects in the requisite endocytic pathways. Despite its protective roles, we could not ectopically overexpress wild type HTRA2, suggesting that mitochondrial HTRA2 hyperactivity is lethal. This toxicity was abolished by replacing the essential catalytic serine S300 with alanine to ablate serine protease activity. Overexpression of protease-dead HTRA2 phenocopied the effects of knockdown, suggesting that the mutant protein competitively inhibits interactions between wild type HTRA2 and its binding partners. Our results show that cytopathological dysfunction can be caused either by too little or too much HTRA2 activity in the mitochondria and suggest that either could be a cause of PD.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in <i>CLN5</i> cause a subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) called CLN5 disease. While the precise role of CLN5 in NCL pathogenesis is not known, recent work revealed that the protein has glycoside hydrolase activity. Previous work on the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> homolog of human CLN5, Cln5, revealed its secretion during the early stages of development and its role in regulating cell adhesion and cAMP-mediated chemotaxis. Here, we used <i>Dictyostelium</i> to examine the effect of <i>cln5</i>-deficiency on various growth and developmental processes during the life cycle. During growth, <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> cells displayed reduced cell proliferation, cytokinesis, viability, and folic acid-mediated chemotaxis. In addition, the growth of <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> cells was severely impaired in nutrient-limiting media. Based on these findings, we assessed autophagic flux in growth-phase cells and observed that loss of <i>cln5</i> increased the number of autophagosomes suggesting that the basal level of autophagy was increased in <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> cells. Similarly, loss of <i>cln5</i> increased the amounts of ubiquitin-positive proteins. During the early stages of multicellular development, the aggregation of <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> cells was delayed and loss of the autophagy genes, <i>atg1</i> and <i>atg9</i>, reduced the extracellular amount of Cln5. We also observed an increased amount of intracellular Cln5 in cells lacking the <i>Dictyostelium</i> homolog of the human glycoside hydrolase, hexosaminidase A (HEXA), further supporting the glycoside hydrolase activity of Cln5. This observation was also supported by our finding that <i>CLN5</i> and <i>HEXA</i> expression are highly correlated in human tissues. Following mound formation, <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> development was precocious and loss of <i>cln5</i> affected spore morphology, germination, and viability. When <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> cells were developed in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor ammonium chloride, the formation of multicellular structures was impaired, and the size of <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> slugs was reduced relative to WT slugs. These results, coupled with the aberrant autophagic flux observed in <i>cln5</i> <sup>-</sup> cells during growth, support a role for Cln5 in autophagy during the <i>Dictyostelium</i> life cycle. In total, this study highlights the multifaceted role of Cln5 in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provides insight into the pathological mechanisms that may underlie CLN5 disease.",

        "abstract": "The origin of multicellular life from unicellular beings is an epochal step in the evolution of eukaryotes. There are several factors influencing cell fate choices during differentiation and morphogenesis of an organism. Genetic make-up of two cells that unite and fertilize is the key factor to signal the formation of various cell-types in due course of development. Although ploidy of the cell-types determines the genetics of an individual, the role of ploidy in cell fate decisions remains unclear. <i>Dictyostelium</i> serves as a versatile model to study the emergence of multicellular life from unicellular life forms. In this work, we investigate the role played by ploidy status of a cell on cell fate commitments during <i>Dictyostelium</i> development. To answer this question, we created <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells of different ploidy: haploid parents and derived isogenic diploids, allowing them to undergo development. The diploid strains used in this study were generated using parasexual genetics. The ploidy status of the haploids and diploids were confirmed by microscopy, flow cytometry, and karyotyping. Prior to reconstitution, we labeled the cells by two methods. First, intragenic expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) and second, staining the amoebae with a vital, fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). RFP labeled haploid cells allowed us to track the haploids in the chimeric aggregates, slugs, and fruiting bodies. The CFSE labeling method allowed us to track both the haploids and the diploids in the chimeric developmental structures. Our findings illustrate that the haploids demonstrate sturdy cell fate commitment starting from the aggregation stage. The haploids remain crowded at the aggregation centers of the haploid-diploid chimeric aggregates. At the slug stage haploids are predominantly occupying the slug posterior, and are visible in the spore population in the fruiting bodies. Our findings show that cell fate decisions during <i>D. discoideum</i> development are highly influenced by the ploidy status of a cell, adding a new aspect to already known factors Here, we report that ploidy status of a cell could also play a crucial role in regulating the cell fate commitments.",

We assume that this integration preference was developed to avoid the disruption of protein-coding genes. Therefore, we recently mapped new integrations of a genetically tagged TRE5-A element at tRNA genes using PCR-based enrichment of integration junctions. However, the PCR-based enrichment produced several artificial DNA fusions that prevented the mapping of integration sites in unknown places of the genome. Here, we reanalyzed the previous experiment using nanopore sequencing. We summarize the advantages and limitations of direct genome resequencing for the mapping of mobile element integrations.",

The NCLs, commonly referred to as Batten disease, are a family of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases that affect all ages and ethnicities globally. Previous research showed that CLN5 participates in a variety of cellular processes. However, the precise function of CLN5 in the cell and the pathway(s) regulating its function are not well understood. In the model organism <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, loss of the <i>CLN5</i> homolog, <i>cln5</i>, impacts various cellular and developmental processes including cell proliferation, cytokinesis, aggregation, cell adhesion, and terminal differentiation. In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics to identify differentially expressed genes underlying <i>cln5</i>-deficiency phenotypes during growth and the early stages of multicellular development. During growth, genes associated with protein ubiquitination/deubiquitination, cell cycle progression, and proteasomal degradation were affected, while genes linked to protein and carbohydrate catabolism were affected during early development. We followed up this analysis by showing that loss of <i>cln5</i> alters the intracellular and extracellular amounts of proliferation repressors during growth and increases the extracellular amount of conditioned medium factor, which regulates cAMP signalling during the early stages of development. Additionally, <i>cln5</i> <sup><i>-</i></sup> cells displayed increased intracellular and extracellular amounts of discoidin, which is involved in cell-substrate adhesion and migration. Previous work in mammalian models reported altered lysosomal enzyme activity due to mutation or loss of <i>CLN5</i>. Here, we detected altered intracellular activities of various carbohydrate enzymes and cathepsins during <i>cln5</i> <sup><i>-</i></sup> growth and starvation. Notably, <i>cln5</i> <sup><i>-</i></sup> cells displayed reduced \u03b2-hexosaminidase activity, which aligns with previous work showing that <i>D. discoideum</i> Cln5 and human CLN5 can cleave the substrate acted upon by \u03b2-hexosaminidase. Finally, consistent with the differential expression of genes associated with proteasomal degradation in <i>cln5</i> <sup><i>-</i></sup> cells, we also observed elevated amounts of a proteasome subunit and reduced proteasome 20S activity during <i>cln5</i> <sup><i>-</i></sup> growth and starvation. Overall, this study reveals the impact of <i>cln5</i>-deficiency on gene expression in <i>D. discoideum</i>, provides insight on the genes and proteins that play a role in regulating Cln5-dependent processes, and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying CLN5 disease.",

In mammals, it is responsible for bicarbonate-induced, cAMP-dependent processes in sperm required for fertilization and postulated to be involved in other bicarbonate- and carbon dioxide-dependent functions throughout the body. Among eukaryotes, sAC-like cyclases have been detected in mammals and in the fungi Dictyostelium; these enzymes display extensive similarity extending through two cyclase catalytic domains and a long carboxy terminal extension. sAC-like cyclases are also found in a number of bacterial phyla (Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria), but these enzymes generally possess only a single catalytic domain and little, if any, homology with the remainder of the mammalian protein. Database mining through a number of recently sequenced genomes identified sAC orthologues in additional metazoan phyla (Arthropoda and Chordata) and additional bacterial phyla (Chloroflexi). Interestingly, the Chloroflexi sAC-like cyclases, a family of three enzymes from the thermophilic eubacterium, Chloroflexus aurantiacus, are more similar to eukaryotic sAC-like cyclases (i.e., mammalian sAC and Dictyostelium SgcA) than they are to other bacterial adenylyl cyclases (ACs) (i.e., from Cyanobacteria). The Chloroflexus sAC-like cyclases each possess two cyclase catalytic domains and extensive similarity with mammalian enzymes through their carboxy termini. We cloned one of the Chloroflexus sAC-like cyclases and confirmed it to be stimulated by bicarbonate. These data extend the family of organisms possessing bicarbonate-responsive ACs to numerous phyla within the bacterial and eukaryotic kingdoms.",

Since then, animals have developed innate immunity in which specialized white-blood cells phagocytes- patrol the body to kill pathogenic bacteria. The social amoebae <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> are prototypical phagocytes that chase various bacteria via chemotaxis and consume them as food via phagocytosis.

Here we present a computational study of cell sorting caused by a combination of cell adhesion and chemotaxis, where we assume that all cells respond equally to the chemotactic signal. To capture in our model mesoscopic properties of biological cells, such as their size and deformability, we use the Cellular Potts Model, a multiscale, cell-based Monte Carlo model. We demonstrate a rich array of cell-sorting phenomena, which depend on a combination of mescoscopic cell properties and tissue level constraints. Under the conditions studied, cell sorting is a fast process, which scales linearly with tissue size. We demonstrate the occurrence of \"absolute negative mobility\", which means that cells may move in the direction opposite to the applied force (here chemotaxis). Moreover, during the sorting, cells may even reverse the direction of motion. Another interesting phenomenon is \"minority sorting\", where the direction of movement does not depend on cell type, but on the frequency of the cell type in the tissue. A special case is the cAMP-wave-driven chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells, which generates pressure waves that guide the sorting. The mechanisms we describe can easily be overlooked in studies of differential cell movement, hence certain experimental observations may be misinterpreted.",

Lamin-like sequences have recently been identified in distantly related eukaryotes, but it remains unclear if these proteins share conserved functions with the lamins found in metazoans. Here, we investigate conserved features between metazoan and amoebozoan lamins using a genetic complementation system to express the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> lamin-like protein NE81 in mammalian cells lacking either specific lamins or all endogenous lamins. We report that NE81 localizes to the nucleus in cells lacking Lamin A/C, and that NE81 expression improves nuclear circularity, reduces nuclear deformability, and prevents nuclear envelope rupture in these cells. However, NE81 did not completely rescue loss of Lamin A/C, and was unable to restore normal distribution of metazoan lamin interactors, such as emerin and nuclear pore complexes, which are frequently displaced in Lamin A/C deficient cells. Collectively, our results indicate that the ability of lamins to modulate the morphology and mechanical properties of nuclei may have been a feature present in the common ancestor of <i>Dictyostelium</i> and animals, whereas other, more specialized interactions may have evolved more recently in metazoan lineages.",

We generate four variants of our model by adjusting parameters that control the strengths of coupled positive feedbacks and the importance of molecules that translocate from the cytosol to the membrane. Each variant exhibits a qualitatively different mode of gradient sensing. Simulations of characteristic behaviors suggest that differences between the variants are most evident at transitions between efficient gradient detection and failure. Based on these results, we propose criteria to distinguish between possible modes of gradient sensing in real cells, where many biochemical parameters may be unknown. We also identify constraints on parameters required for efficient gradient detection. Finally, our analysis suggests how a cell might transition between responsiveness and nonresponsiveness, and between different modes of gradient sensing, by adjusting its biochemical parameters.",

Here, we show that the glycine-rich transmembrane domain (TMD) of SibA is sufficient to confer Phg1A-dependent surface targeting to a reporter protein. Accordingly, in Dictyostelium phg1A-knockout (KO) cells, proteins with glycine-rich TMDs were less efficiently transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to the cell surface. Phg1A, as well as its human ortholog TM9SF4 specifically associated with glycine-rich TMDs. In human cells, genetic inactivation of TM9SF4 resulted in an increased retention of glycine-rich TMDs in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas TM9SF4 overexpression enhanced their surface localization. The bulk of the TM9SF4 protein was localized in the Golgi complex and a proximity-ligation assay suggested that it might interact with glycine-rich TMDs. Taken together, these results suggest that one of the main roles of TM9 proteins is to serve as intramembrane cargo receptors controlling exocytosis and surface localization of a subset of membrane proteins.",

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> microvesicles have recently been presented as a valuable model for eukaryotic extracellular vesicles. Here, the advantages of <i>D. discoideum</i> for unraveling important biological functions of extracellular vesicles in general are detailed. <i>D. discoideum,</i> a non-pathogenic eukaryotic microorganism, belongs to a billion-year-old <i>Amoeboza</i> lineage, which diverged from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant animal-split. During growth and early starvation-induced development, it presents analogies with lymphocytes and macrophages with regard to motility and phagocytosis capability, respectively. Its 6-chromosome genome codes for about 12,500 genes, some showing analogies with human genes. The presence of extracellular vesicles during cell growth has been evidenced as a detoxification mechanism of various structurally unrelated drugs. Controls led to the discovery of constitutive extracellular vesicle secretion in this microorganism, which was an important point. It means that the secretion of extracellular vesicles occurs, in the absence of any drug, during both cell growth and early development. This constitutive secretion of <i>D. discoideum</i> cells is very likely to play a role in intercellular communication. The detoxifying secreted vesicles, which can transport drugs outside the cells, can also act as \"Trojan horses\", capable of transferring these drugs not only into na\u00efve <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> cells, but into human cells as well. Therefore, these extracellular vesicles were proposed as a new biological drug delivery tool. Moreover, <i>Dictyostelium</i>, chosen by the NIH (USA) as a new model organism for biomedical research, has already been used for studying some human diseases. These cells, which are much easier to manipulate than human cells, can be easily designed in simple conditioned medium experiments. Owing to the increasing consensus that extracellular vesicles are probably important mediators of intercellular communication, <i>D.\u00a0discoideum</i> is here suggested to constitute a convenient model for tracking as yet unknown biological functions of eukaryotic extracellular vesicles.",

        "abstract": "The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system is a specialized secretion pathway required for bacteria to export fully folded proteins through the cytoplasmic membrane. This system is crucial during <i>Salmonella</i> infection of animal hosts. In this study, we show that <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>. Typhimurium) requires the Tat system to survive and proliferate intracellularly in the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. To achieve this, we developed a new infection assay to assess intracellular bacterial loads in amoeba by direct enumeration of colony forming units (CFU) at different times of infection. Using this assay we observed that a \u0394<i>tatABC</i> mutant was internalized in higher numbers than the wild type, and was defective for intracellular survival in the amoeba at all times post infection evaluated. In addition, we assessed the effect of the \u0394<i>tatABC</i> mutant in the social development of <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i>. In contrast to the wild-type strain, we observed that the mutant was unable to delay the social development of the amoeba at 2 days of co-incubation. This phenotype correlated with defects in intracellular proliferation presented by the \u0394<i>tatABC</i> mutant in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> after 24 h of infection. All phenotypes described for the mutant were reverted by the presence of a plasmid carrying <i>tatABC</i> genes, indicating that abrogation of Tat system attenuates <i>S</i>.

Typhimurium to survive and proliferate intracellularly in <i>D. discoideum</i> and for virulence in this host. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the relevance of the Tat system in the interaction of any bacterial pathogen with the social amoeba <i>D. discoideum</i>.",

        "abstract": "In mammals, D-Ser is synthesized by serine racemase (SR) and degraded by D-amino acid oxidase (DAO). D-Ser acts as an endogenous ligand for <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- and \u03b42 glutamate receptors, and is involved in brain functions such as learning and memory. Although SR homologs are highly conserved in eukaryotes, little is known about the significance of D-Ser in non-mammals. In contrast to mammals, the slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> genome encodes SR, DAO, and additionally D-Ser specific degradation enzyme D-Ser dehydratase (DSD), but not NMDA- and \u03b42 glutamate receptors. Here, we studied the significances of D-Ser and DSD in <i>D. discoideum</i>. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that DSD is 460- and 1,700-fold more active than DAO and SR, respectively, in degrading D-Ser. Moreover, in <i>dsd</i>-null cells D-Ser degradation activity is completely abolished. In fact, while in wild-type <i>D. discoideum</i> intracellular D-Ser levels were considerably low, <i>dsd</i>-null cells accumulated D-Ser. These results indicated that DSD but not DAO is the primary enzyme responsible for D-Ser decomposition in <i>D. discoideum</i>. We found that <i>dsd</i>-null cells exhibit delay in development and arrest at the early culmination stage. The efficiency of spore formation was considerably reduced in the mutant cells. These phenotypes were further pronounced by exogenous D-Ser but rescued by plasmid-borne expression of <i>dsd</i>. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that mRNA expression of key genes in the cAMP signaling relay is perturbed in the <i>dsd</i> knockout. Our data indicate novel roles for D-Ser and/or DSD in the regulation of cAMP signaling in the development processes of <i>D. discoideum</i>.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a microfluidic device that geometrically constrains the development of individual <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells into multicellular organisms (slugs). A microchip for the stimuli-directed migration of slugs is also presented. To demonstrate the formation of slugs in a predetermined shape, a microchip is designed to confine the slugs in the vertical direction. In the microchip, sufficient oxygen is supplied to the cells via a membrane, allowing the formation and adaptation of slugs to the shape of the channel. In addition, the manipulation of slug migration direction in a microchip via external stimuli, such as light and temperature gradients, that induce phototaxis and thermotaxis of slugs, respectively, is demonstrated. To direct slug migration with external stimuli, an optical fiber is used for phototaxis and an electrical wire heater is used for thermotaxis. Experimental results show slug formation in a predefined geometry in the microchip, suggesting that this chip is potentially useful for understanding the relationship between the shape and function of cells or tissue. The controlled migration of slugs demonstrated in the microchips can potentially be employed in biologically based microactuators or microrobots.",

        "abstract": "The assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles is important for numerous cellular processes, including nutrient uptake and membrane organization. Important contributors to clathrin assembly are four tetrameric assembly proteins, also called adaptor proteins (APs), each of which contains a \u03b2 subunit. We identified a single \u03b2 subunit, named \u03b21/2, that contributes to both the AP1 and AP2 complexes of Dictyostelium. Disruption of the gene encoding \u03b21/2 resulted in severe defects in growth, cytokinesis and development. Additionally, cells lacking \u03b21/2 displayed profound osmoregulatory defects including the absence of contractile vacuoles and mislocalization of contractile vacuole markers. The phenotypes of \u03b21/2 null cells were most similar to previously described phenotypes of clathrin and AP1 mutants, supporting a particularly important contribution of AP1 to clathrin pathways in Dictyostelium cells. The absence of \u03b21/2 in cells led to significant reductions in the protein amounts of the medium-sized subunits of the AP1 and AP2 complexes, establishing a role for the \u03b2 subunit in the stability of the medium subunits. Dictyostelium \u03b21/2 could resemble a common ancestor of the more specialized \u03b21 and \u03b22 subunits of the vertebrate AP complexes. Our results support the essential contribution of a single \u03b2 subunit to the stability and function of AP1 and AP2 in a simple eukaryote.",

        "abstract": "In Dictyostelium cAMP and cGMP have important functions as first and second messengers in chemotaxis and development. Two cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterases (DdPDE 1 and 2) have been identified previously, an extracellular dual-specificity enzyme and an intracellular cAMP-specific enzyme (encoded by the psdA and regA genes respectively). Biochemical data suggest the presence of at least one cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) that is activated by cGMP. Using bioinformatics we identified a partial sequence in the Dictyostelium expressed sequence tag database that shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with mammalian PDE catalytic domains (DdPDE3). The deduced amino acid sequence of a full-length DdPDE3 cDNA isolated in this study predicts a 60 kDa protein with a 300-residue C-terminal PDE catalytic domain, which is preceded by approx. 200 residues rich in asparagine and glutamine residues. Expression of the DdPDE3 catalytic domain in Escherichia coli shows that the enzyme has Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a higher affinity for cGMP (K(m)=0.22 microM) than for cAMP (K(m)=145 microM); cGMP does not stimulate enzyme activity. The enzyme requires bivalent cations for activity; Mn(2+) is preferred to Mg(2+), whereas Ca(2+) yields no activity. DdPDE3 is inhibited by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with an IC(50) of approx. 60 microM. Overexpression of the DdPDE3 catalytic domain in Dictyostelium confirms these kinetic properties without indications of its activation by cGMP. The properties of DdPDE3 resemble those of mammalian PDE9, which also shows the highest sequence similarity within the catalytic domains. DdPDE3 is the first cGMP-selective PDE identified in lower eukaryotes.",

We cured and cross-infected ameba hosts with different symbionts. We found that warming significantly decreased <i>D.\u00a0discoideum's</i> fitness, and we found no sign of local adaptation in two wild populations. Experimental warming had complex effects on these symbioses with responses determined by both symbiont and host. Neither of these facultative symbionts increases its hosts' thermal tolerance. The nearly obligate symbiont with a reduced genome, <i>P.\u00a0hayleyella</i>, actually decreases <i>D.\u00a0discoideum's</i> thermal tolerance and even causes symbiosis breakdown.

During chemotaxis, G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits regulate actin assembly and migration, but the protein(s) linking G\u03b2\u03b3 to the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown. Here, we identified a G\u03b2\u03b3 effector, ElmoE in Dictyostelium, and demonstrated that it is required for GPCR-mediated chemotaxis. Remarkably, ElmoE associates with G\u03b2\u03b3 and Dock-like proteins to activate the small GTPase Rac, in a GPCR-dependent manner, and also associates with Arp2/3 complex and F-actin. Thus, ElmoE serves as a link between chemoattractant GPCRs, G-proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. The pathway, consisting of GPCR, G\u03b2\u03b3, Elmo/Dock, Rac, and Arp2/3, spatially guides the growth of dendritic actin networks in pseudopods of eukaryotic cells during chemotaxis.",

If there are too many cells in a group, as indicated by high extracellular concentrations of CF, the cells break up the group by decreasing cell-cell adhesion and increasing random cell motility. As a part of the signal transduction pathway, CF decreases the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase to decrease internal glucose levels. CF also decreases the levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and increases the levels of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.

Here, by using the model system Dictyostelium and exploiting the characteristic chemoattractant-stimulated translocation of polarly distributed molecules, we developed a proteomic screening approach, through which we identified a leucine-rich repeat domain-containing protein we named Leep1 as a novel polarity regulator. We combined imaging, biochemical, and phenotypic analyses to demonstrate that Leep1 localizes selectively at the leading edge of cells by binding to PIP3, where it modulates pseudopod and macropinocytic cup dynamics by negatively regulating the Scar/WAVE complex. The spatiotemporal coordination of PIP3 signaling, Leep1, and the Scar/WAVE complex provides a cellular mechanism for organizing protrusive structures at the leading edge.",

Dictyostelium express multiple myosin Is, including three short-tailed (Myo1A, Myo1E, Myo1F) and three long-tailed (Myo1B, Myo1C, Myo1D). Here we report the molecular basis of the specific localizations of short-tailed Myo1A, Myo1E, and Myo1F compared to our previously determined localization of long-tailed Myo1B. Myo1A and Myo1B have common and unique localizations consistent with the various features of their tail region; specifically the BH sites in their tails are required for their association with the plasma membrane and heads are sufficient for relocalization to the front of polarized cells. Myo1A does not localize to actin waves and macropinocytic protrusions, in agreement with the absence of a tail region which is required for these localizations of Myo1B. However, in spite of the overall similarity of their domain structures, the cellular distributions of Myo1E and Myo1F are quite different from Myo1A. Myo1E and Myo1F, but not Myo1A, are associated with macropinocytic cups and actin waves. The localizations of Myo1E and Myo1F in macropinocytic structures and actin waves differ from the localization of Myo1B. Myo1B colocalizes with F-actin in the actin waves and at the tips of mature macropinocytic cups whereas Myo1E and Myo1F are in the interior of actin waves and along the entire surface of macropinocytic cups. Our results point to different mechanisms of targeting of short- and long-tailed myosin Is, and are consistent with these myosins having both shared and divergent cellular functions.",

        "title": "Relevant Genes Linked to Virulence Are Required for Salmonella Typhimurium to Survive Intracellularly in the Social Amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.",
        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has proven to be a useful model for studying relevant aspects of the host-pathogen interaction. In this work, D. discoideum was used as a model to study the ability of Salmonella Typhimurium to survive in amoebae and to evaluate the contribution of selected genes in this process. To do this, we performed infection assays using axenic cultures of D. discoideum co-cultured with wild-type S. Typhimurium and/or defined mutant strains. Our results confirmed that wild-type S. Typhimurium is able to survive intracellularly in D. discoideum. In contrast, mutants \u0394aroA and \u0394waaL are defective in intracellular survival in this amoeba. Next, we included in our study a group of mutants in genes directly linked to Salmonella virulence. Of note, mutants \u0394invA, \u0394ssaD, \u0394clpV, and \u0394phoPQ also showed an impaired ability to survive intracellularly in D. discoideum. This indicates that S. Typhimurium requires a functional biosynthetic pathway of aromatic compounds, a lipopolysaccharide containing a complete O-antigen, the type III secretion systems (T3SS) encoded in SPI-1 and SPI-2, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded in SPI-6 and PhoP/PhoQ two-component system to survive in D. discoideum. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the requirement of O-antigen and T6SS in the survival of Salmonella within amoebae. In addition, mutants \u0394invA and \u0394ssaD were internalized in higher numbers than the wild-type strain during competitive infections, suggesting that S. Typhimurium requires the T3SS encoded in SPI-1 and SPI-2 to evade phagocytosis by D. discoideum. Altogether, these results indicate that S. Typhimurium exploits a common set of genes and molecular mechanisms to survive within amoeba and animal host cells. The use of D. discoideum as a model for host-pathogen interactions will allow us to discover the gene repertoire used by Salmonella to survive inside the amoeba and to study the cellular processes that are affected during infection.",

In the presence of a nucleotide acceptor, the phosphohistidine bond is unstable and the phosphate is transferred to the acceptor in less than 1 msec. We describe the synthesis of an analog of the phosphoenzyme intermediate with an inactive mutant of NDP kinase in which the catalytic histidine is replaced by a cysteine. In two sequential disulfide exchange reactions, a thiophosphate group reacts with the thiol function of the cysteine that had previously reacted with dithionitrobenzoate (DTNB). The thiophosphoenzyme presents a 400,000-fold increased stability in the presence of NDPs compared with the phosphoenzyme. The binding of NDP is studied at the steady state and presteady state. Data were analyzed according to a bimolecular association model. For the first time, the true equilibrium dissociation constants of NDP for the analog of the phosphoenzyme are determined in the absence of phosphotransfer, allowing a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli, a commensal bacterium from the intestinal tracts of humans and vertebrate animals, has been used as one of two bacterial indicators of fecal contamination, along with intestinal enterococci, to monitor the microbiological quality of water. However, water environments are now recognized as a secondary habitat where some strains can survive. We investigated the survival of E. coli isolates collected from bodies of water in France exhibiting distinct profiles of contamination, defined according to the following criteria: vicinity of the point sources of contamination, land use, hydrology, and physicochemical characteristics of the receiving water. We selected 88 E. coli strains among a collection of 352 strains to carry out a microcosm experiment in filtered estuarine water for 14 days at 10\u00b0C. The relationship between the survival of E. coli strains and genotypic and phenotypic characteristics was analyzed. This work showed that distinct E. coli survival types, able to survive from between 7 and 14 days to less than 2 days, coexisted in the water. E. coli isolates that rapidly lost their culturability were more frequently isolated in water recently contaminated by fecal bacteria of human origin, and most were multiresistant to antibiotics and harbored several virulence factors. In contrast, persistent strains able to survive from 4 to 14 days were more often found in water with low levels of fecal bacteria, belonged mainly to the B1 phylogroup, often harbored only one virulence factor, kspE or ompT, and were able to grow at 7\u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of environmental bacteria with unicellular eukaryotes is generally considered a major driving force for the evolution of intracellular pathogens, allowing them to survive and replicate in phagocytic cells of vertebrate hosts. To test this hypothesis on a genome-wide level, we determined for the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium marinum whether it uses conserved strategies to exploit host cells from both protozoan and vertebrate origin. Using transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), we determined differences in genetic requirements for survival and replication in phagocytic cells of organisms from different kingdoms. In line with the general hypothesis, we identified a number of general virulence mechanisms, including the type VII protein secretion system ESX-1, biosynthesis of polyketide lipids, and utilization of sterols. However, we were also able to show that M. marinum contains an even larger set of host-specific virulence determinants, including proteins involved in the modification of surface glycolipids and, surprisingly, the auxiliary proteins of the ESX-1 system. Several of these factors were in fact counterproductive in other hosts. Therefore, M. marinum contains different sets of virulence factors that are tailored for specific hosts. Our data imply that although amoebae could function as a training ground for intracellular pathogens, they do not fully prepare pathogens for crossing species barriers.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the link between cell movement and plasma membrane recycling using a fast-acting, temperature-sensitive mutant of the Dictyostelium SecA exocytic protein. Strikingly, most mutant cells become almost paralysed within minutes at the restrictive temperature. However, they can still sense cyclic-AMP (cAMP) gradients and polymerise actin up-gradient, but form only abortive pseudopodia, which cannot expand. They also relay a cAMP signal normally, suggesting that cAMP is released by a non-exocytic mechanism. To investigate why SecA is required for motility, we examined membrane trafficking in the mutant. Plasma membrane circulation is rapidly inhibited at the restrictive temperature and the cells acquire a prominent vesicle. Organelle-specific markers show that this is an undischarged contractile vacuole, and we found the cells are correspondingly osmo-sensitive. Electron microscopy shows that many smaller vesicles, probably originating from the plasma membrane, also accumulate at the restrictive temperature. Consistent with this, the surface area of mutant cells shrinks. We suggest that SecA mutant cells cannot move at the restrictive temperature because their block in exocytosis results in a net uptake of plasma membrane, reducing its area, and so restricting pseudopodial expansion. This demonstrates the importance of proper surface area regulation in cell movement.",

NTA is valuable for studying the size distribution and concentration, Cryo-EM is outstanding for the morphological characterisation, including observation of vesicle heterogeneity, while RTM provides the global chemical composition without using any exogenous label. The capabilities of this approach are evaluated on the example of cell-derived vesicles of Dictyostelium discoideum, a convenient general model for eukaryotic EVs. At least 2 separate species differing in chemical composition (relative amounts of DNA, lipids and proteins, presence of carotenoids) were found for each of the 2 physiological states of this non-pathogenic microorganism, that is, cell growth and starvation-induced aggregation. These findings demonstrate the specific potency of RTM. In addition, the first Raman spectra of human urinary exosomes are reported, presumably constituting the primary step towards Raman characterisation of EVs for the purpose of human diseases diagnoses.",

        "abstract": "<i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> is a soil-dwelling unicellular eukaryote that accumulates extracellular polyphosphate (polyP). At high cell densities, when the cells are about to overgrow their food supply and starve, the corresponding high extracellular concentrations of polyP allow the cells to preemptively anticipate starvation, inhibit proliferation, and prime themselves to begin development. In this report, we show that starved <i>D. discoideum</i> cells accumulate cell surface and extracellular polyP. Starvation reduces macropinocytosis, exocytosis, and phagocytosis, and we find that these effects require the G protein-coupled polyP receptor (GrlD) and two enzymes, Polyphosphate kinase 1 (Ppk1), which is required for synthesizing intracellular polyP, cell surface polyP, and some of the extracellular polyP, and Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase (I6kA), which is required for cell surface polyP and polyP binding to cells, and some of the extracellular polyP. PolyP reduces membrane fluidity, and we find that starvation reduces membrane fluidity, and this effect requires GrlD and Ppk1 but not I6kA. Together, these data suggest that in starved cells, extracellular polyP decreases membrane fluidity, possibly as a protective measure. In the starved cells, sensing polyP appears to decrease energy expenditure from ingestion, and decrease exocytosis, to both decrease energy expenditures and retain nutrients.",

Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction. To better understand the function of VASP in filopodium formation, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of Dictyostelium VASP (DdVASP) and extended our findings to human VASP. Recombinant VASP from both species nucleated and bundled actin filaments, but did not compete with capping proteins or block depolymerization from barbed ends. Together with the finding that DdVASP binds to the FH2 domain of dDia2, these data indicate that the crucial role of VASP in filopodium formation is different from uncapping of actin filaments. To identify the activity of DdVASP required in this process, rescue experiments of DdVASP-null cells with mutant DdVASP constructs were performed. Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia. Our data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments.",

Some of these effectors contain eukaryotic domains such as the RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1) repeats promoting the activation of the small GTPase Ran. In this report, we reveal a conserved pattern of <i>L. pneumophila</i> RCC1 repeat genes, which are distributed in two main clusters of strains. Accordingly, strain Philadelphia-1 contains two RCC1 genes implicated in bacterial virulence, <i>legG1</i> (<i>Legionella</i> eukaryotic gene 1), and <i>ppgA</i>, while strain Paris contains only one, <i>pieG</i> The RCC1 repeat effectors localize to different cellular compartments and bind distinct components of the Ran GTPase cycle, including Ran modulators and the small GTPase itself, and yet they all promote the activation of Ran.

The opportunistic pathogen grows in amoebae and macrophages by employing a \"type IV\" secretion system, which secretes more than 300 different \"effector\" proteins into the host cell, where they subvert pivotal processes. The function of many of these effector proteins is unknown, and their evolution has not been studied. <i>L. pneumophila</i> RCC1 repeat effectors target the small GTPase Ran, a molecular switch implicated in different cellular processes such as nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics. We provide evidence that one or more RCC1 repeat genes are distributed in two main clusters of <i>L. pneumophila</i> strains and have divergently evolved to target different components of the Ran GTPase activation cycle at different subcellular sites. Thus, <i>L. pneumophila</i> employs a sophisticated strategy to subvert host cell Ran GTPase during infection.",

Adaptation of B. cenocepacia to the CF airways may play an important role in the persistence of the infection. We have identified a sensor kinase-response regulator (BCAM0379) named AtsR in B. cenocepacia K56-2 that shares 19% amino acid identity with RetS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. atsR inactivation led to increased biofilm production and a hyperadherent phenotype in both abiotic surfaces and lung epithelial cells. Also, the atsR mutant overexpressed and hypersecreted an Hcp-like protein known to be specifically secreted by the type VI secretion system (T6SS) in other gram-negative bacteria. Amoeba plaque assays demonstrated that the atsR mutant was more resistant to Dictyostelium predation than the wild-type strain and that this phenomenon was T6SS dependent. Macrophage infection assays also demonstrated that the atsR mutant induces the formation of actin-mediated protrusions from macrophages that require a functional Hcp-like protein, suggesting that the T6SS is involved in actin rearrangements. Three B. cenocepacia transposon mutants that were found in a previous study to be impaired for survival in chronic lung infection model were mapped to the T6SS gene cluster, indicating that the T6SS is required for infection in vivo. Together, our data show that AtsR is involved in the regulation of genes required for virulence in B. cenocepacia K56-2, including genes encoding a T6SS.",

We modified by experimental evolution the efficiency of individual cells in attaching to a surface. Surprisingly, evolution appears to have produced social cooperators irrespective of whether stronger or weaker adhesion was selected. Quantification of reproductive success, cell-cell adhesion, and developmental patterns, however, revealed two distinct social behaviors, as captured when the classical metric for social success is generalized by considering clonal spore production.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that <i>Escherichia coli</i> can survive in different environments, including soils, and they can maintain populations in sterile soil for a long period of time. This indicates that growth-supporting nutrients are available; however, when grown in non-sterile soils, populations decline, suggesting that other biological factors play a role in controlling <i>E. coli</i> populations in soil. Free-living protozoa can affect the bacterial population by grazing. We hypothesized that <i>E. coli</i> strains capable of surviving in non-sterile soil possess mechanisms to protect themselves from amoeba predation. We determined the grazing rate of <i>E. coli</i> pasture isolates by using <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Bacterial suspensions applied to lactose agar as lines were allowed to grow for 24 h, when 4 \u03bcL of <i>D. discoideum</i> culture was inoculated in the center of each bacterial line. Grazing distances were measured after 4 days. The genomes of five grazing-susceptible and five grazing-resistant isolates were sequenced and compared. Grazing distance varied among isolates, which indicated that some <i>E. coli</i> are more susceptible to grazing by protozoa than others. When presented with a choice between grazing-susceptible and grazing-resistant isolates, <i>D. discoideum</i> grazed only on the susceptible strain. Grazing susceptibility phenotype did not align with the phylogroup, with both B1 and E strains found in both grazing groups. They also did not align by core genome phylogeny. Whole genome comparisons revealed that the five most highly grazed strains had 389 shared genes not found in the five least grazed strains. Conversely, the five least grazed strains shared 130 unique genes. The results indicate that long-term persistence of <i>E. coli</i> in soil is due at least in part to resistance to grazing by soil amoeba.",

        "abstract": "Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) contribute to the pathogenicity of several mycobacteria. Biosynthesis of these virulence factors requires polyketide synthases and other enzymes that represent potential targets for the development of adjuvant antivirulence drugs. We used six isogenic Mycobacterium marinum mutants, each with a different gene knockout in the PDIM/PGL biosynthetic pathway, to probe the pleiotropy of mutations leading to PDIM(-) PGL(-), PDIM(+) PGL(-) or PDIM(-) PGL(+) phenotypes. We evaluated the M. marinum mutants for changes in antibiotic susceptibility, cell envelope permeability, biofilm formation, surface properties, sliding motility and virulence in an amoeba model. The analysis also permitted us to begin exploring the hypothesis that different gene knockouts rendering the same PDIM and/or PGL deficiency phenotypes lead to M. marinum mutants with equivalent pleiotropic profiles. Overall, the results of our study revealed a complex picture of pleiotropic patterns emerging from different gene knockouts, uncovered unexpected phenotypic inequalities between mutants, and provided new insight into the phenotypic consequences of gene knockouts in the PDIM/PGL biosynthetic pathway.",

        "abstract": "Cell migration is involved in diverse physiological processes including embryogenesis, immunity, and diseases such as cancer and chronic inflammatory disease. The movement of many cell types is directed by extracellular gradients of diffusible chemicals. This phenomenon, referred to as \"chemotaxis\", was first described in 1888 by Leber who observed the movement of leukocytes toward sites of inflammation. We now know that a large family of small proteins, chemokines, serves as the extracellular signals and a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), chemokine receptors, detects gradients of chemokines and guides cell movement in vivo. Currently, we still know little about the molecular machineries that control chemokine gradient sensing and migration of immune cells. Fortunately, the molecular mechanisms that control these fundamental aspects of chemotaxis appear to be evolutionarily conserved, and studies in lower eukaryotic model systems have allowed us to form concepts, uncover molecular components, develop new techniques, and test models of chemotaxis. These studies have helped our current understanding of this complicated cell behavior. In this review, we wish to mention landmark discoveries in the chemotaxis research field that shaped our current understanding of this fundamental cell behavior and lay out key questions that remain to be addressed in the future.",

        "abstract": "For directional movement, eukaryotic cells depend on the proper organization of their actin cytoskeleton. This engine of motility is made up of highly dynamic nonequilibrium actin structures such as flashes, oscillations, and traveling waves. In Dictyostelium, oscillatory actin foci interact with signals such as Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to form protrusions. However, how signaling cues tame actin dynamics to produce a pseudopod and guide cellular motility is a critical open question in eukaryotic chemotaxis. Here, we demonstrate that the strength of coupling between individual actin oscillators controls cell polarization and directional movement. We implement an inducible sequestration system to inactivate the heterotrimeric G protein subunit G\u03b2 and find that this acute perturbation triggers persistent, high-amplitude cortical oscillations of F-actin. Actin oscillators that are normally weakly coupled to one another in wild-type cells become strongly synchronized following acute inactivation of G\u03b2. This global coupling impairs sensing of internal cues during spontaneous polarization and sensing of external cues during directional motility. A simple mathematical model of coupled actin oscillators reveals the importance of appropriate coupling strength for chemotaxis: moderate coupling can increase sensitivity to noisy inputs. Taken together, our data suggest that G\u03b2 regulates the strength of coupling between actin oscillators for efficient polarity and directional migration. As these observations are only possible following acute inhibition of G\u03b2 and are masked by slow compensation in genetic knockouts, our work also shows that acute loss-of-function approaches can complement and extend the reach of classical genetics in Dictyostelium and likely other systems as well.",

        "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves damage to lungs causing an influx of neutrophils from the blood into the lung airspaces, and the neutrophils causing further damage, which attracts more neutrophils in a vicious cycle. There are \u223c190,000 cases of ARDS per year in the US, and because of the lack of therapeutics, the mortality rate is \u223c40%. Repelling neutrophils out of the lung airspaces, or simply preventing neutrophil entry, is a potential therapeutic. In this minireview, we discuss how our lab noticed that a protein called AprA secreted by growing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells functions as a repellent for <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells, causing cells to move away from a source of AprA. We then found that AprA has structural similarity to a human secreted protein called dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), and that DPPIV is a repellent for human neutrophils. In animal models of ARDS, inhalation of DPPIV or DPPIV mimetics blocks neutrophil influx into the lungs. To move DPPIV or DPPIV mimetics into the clinic, we need to know how this repulsion works to understand possible drug interactions and side effects. Combining biochemistry and genetics in <i>Dictyostelium</i> to elucidate the AprA signal transduction pathway, followed by drug studies in human neutrophils to determine similarities and differences between neutrophil and <i>Dictyostelium</i> chemorepulsion, will hopefully lead to the safe use of DPPIV or DPPIV mimetics in the clinic.",

While bacterial cells have been successfully employed to drive the swimming motion of micrometer-sized cargo particles, the transport capacities of motile adherent cells remain largely unexplored. Here, it is demonstrated that motile amoeboid cells can act as efficient and versatile trucks to transport microcargo. When incubated together with microparticles, cells of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> readily pick up and move the cargo particles. Relying on the unspecific adhesive properties of the amoeba, a wide range of different cargo materials can be used. The cell-driven transport can be directionally guided based on the chemotactic responses of amoeba to chemoattractant gradients. On the one hand, the cargo can be assembled into clusters in a self-organized fashion, relying on the developmentally induced chemotactic aggregation of cells. On the other hand, chemoattractant gradients can be externally imposed to guide the cellular microtrucks to a desired location. Finally, larger cargo particles of different shapes that exceed the size of a single cell by more than an order of magnitude, can also be transported by the collective effort of large numbers of motile cells.",

        "abstract": "The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in Dictyostelium. To understand how ampA influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, sma, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using sma gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for sma in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the sma gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell-cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing ampA mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in ampA pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in Dictyostelium and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.",

Figure 1 depicts the localization of DdCenB at three points in the cell cycle: interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis. In interphase DdCenB primarily localizes to the nuclear envelope (NE). Although the NE remains intact during mitosis and cytokinesis in Dictyostelium, DdCenB disappears from the NE at these two stages of the cell cycle. In addition to localization at the NE, we also see weak localization in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (weakest). Although the nucleoplasmic concentration appears constant throughout the cell cycle, the very faint localization in the cytoplasm does appear to increase to the level of the nucleoplasm during mitosis and cytokinesis. Unlike most centrins characterized to date, we found no evidence of DdCenB at the centrosome at any point in the cell cycle. Here we examine the importance of DdCenB localization in cell cycle progression, as well as several other roles.",

        "abstract": "The Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic bypass comprises evolutionarily conserved reactions that generate and dephosphorylate 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). For >30 years, these reactions have been considered the responsibility of a single enzyme, the 2,3-BPG synthase/2-phosphatase (BPGM). Here, we show that Dictyostelium, birds, and mammals contain an additional 2,3-BPG phosphatase that, unlike BPGM, removes the 3-phosphate. This discovery reveals that the glycolytic pathway can bypass the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate, which is a precursor for serine biosynthesis and an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase. Our 2,3-BPG phosphatase activity is encoded by the previously identified gene for multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (MIPP1), which we now show to have dual substrate specificity. By genetically manipulating Mipp1 expression in Dictyostelium, we demonstrated that this enzyme provides physiologically relevant regulation of cellular 2,3-BPG content. Mammalian erythrocytes possess the highest content of 2,3-BPG, which controls oxygen binding to hemoglobin. We determined that total MIPP1 activity in erythrocytes at 37 degrees C is 0.6 mmol 2,3-BPG hydrolyzed per liter of cells per h, matching previously published estimates of the phosphatase activity of BPGM. MIPP1 is active at 4 degrees C, revealing a clinically significant contribution to 2,3-BPG loss during the storage of erythrocytes for transfusion. Hydrolysis of 2,3-BPG by human MIPP1 is sensitive to physiologic alkalosis; activity decreases 50% when pH rises from 7.0 to 7.4. This phenomenon provides a homeostatic mechanism for elevating 2,3-BPG levels, thereby enhancing oxygen release to tissues. Our data indicate greater biological significance of the Rapoport-Luebering shunt than previously considered.",

We show that formation of the membrane tubes and their transition into chains of pearls do not require external tension, and that they neither depend on microtubule-based molecular motors nor pressure generated by myosin-II. Pearling thus differs from blebbing. The pearling state is stable as long as actin is prevented from polymerizing. When polymerization is restored, the pearls are retracted into the cell, indicating continuity of the membrane. Our data suggest that the alternation of pearls and strings is an energetically favored state of the unsupported plasma membrane, and that one of the functions of the actin cortex is to prevent the membrane from spontaneously assuming this configuration.",

        "abstract": "Skp1, a subunit of E3 Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box protein ubiquitin ligases, is modified by a prolyl hydroxylase that mediates O<sub>2</sub> regulation of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i> and the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> The full effect of hydroxylation requires modification of the hydroxyproline by a pentasaccharide that, in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, influences Skp1 structure to favor assembly of Skp1/F-box protein subcomplexes. In <i>Toxoplasma</i>, the presence of a contrasting penultimate sugar assembled by a different glycosyltransferase enables testing of the conformational control model. To define the final sugar and its linkage, here we identified the glycosyltransferase that completes the glycan and found that it is closely related to glycogenin, an enzyme that may prime glycogen synthesis in yeast and animals. However, the <i>Toxoplasma</i> enzyme catalyzes formation of a Gal\u03b11,3Glc\u03b1 linkage rather than the Glc\u03b11,4Glc\u03b1 linkage formed by glycogenin. Kinetic and crystallographic experiments showed that the glycosyltransferase Gat1 is specific for Skp1 in <i>Toxoplasma</i> and also in another protist, the crop pathogen <i>Pythium ultimum</i> The fifth sugar is important for glycan function as indicated by the slow-growth phenotype of <i>gat1</i>\u0394 parasites. Computational analyses indicated that, despite the sequence difference, the <i>Toxoplasma</i> glycan still assumes an ordered conformation that controls Skp1 structure and revealed the importance of nonpolar packing interactions of the fifth sugar. The substitution of glycosyltransferases in <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>Pythium</i> by an unrelated bifunctional enzyme that assembles a distinct but structurally compatible glycan in <i>Dictyostelium</i> is a remarkable case of convergent evolution, which emphasizes the importance of the terminal \u03b1-galactose and establishes the phylogenetic breadth of Skp1 glycoregulation.",

The receptor(s) for DIF-1 and DIF-2 have not yet been identified. We examined the effects of nine derivatives of DIF-1 on chemotactic cell movement toward cAMP and compared their chemotaxis-modulating activity and stalk cell differentiation-inducing activity in wild-type and mutant strains. The DIF derivatives differentially affected chemotaxis and stalk cell differentiation; for example, TM-DIF-1 suppressed chemotaxis and showed poor stalk-inducing activity, DIF-1(3M) suppressed chemotaxis and showed strong stalk-inducing activity, and TH-DIF-1 promoted chemotaxis. These results suggest that DIF-1 and DIF-2 have at least three receptors: one for stalk cell induction and two for chemotaxis modulation. In addition, our results show that the DIF derivatives can be used to analyze the DIF-signaling pathways in <i>D. discoideum</i>.",

In principle, certain features of spatial patterns emerging with time may be regulated by variability or, more specifically, by certain constellations of cell-to-cell differences. Similarly, measuring variability in a system (i.e. the spatial distribution of cell-cell differences) may help predict properties of later-stage patterns.Here we apply and compare different statistical methods of extracting such systematic cell-to-cell differences in the case of patterns generated with a simple model system of an excitable medium and of experimental data by the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. We demonstrate with the help of a correlation analysis that these methods produce systematic (i.e. stationary) results for cell properties. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of our method, in particular how these cell properties may serve as predictors of certain later-stage patterns.",

        "abstract": "Ammonia has been shown to function as a morphogen at multiple steps during the development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum; however, it is largely unknown how intracellular ammonia levels are controlled. In the Dictyostelium genome, there are five genes that encode putative ammonium transporters: amtA, amtB, amtC, rhgA, and rhgB. Here, we show that AmtA regulates ammonia homeostasis during growth and development. We found that cells lacking amtA had increased levels of ammonia/ammonium, whereas their extracellular ammonia/ammonium levels were highly decreased. These results suggest that AmtA mediates the excretion of ammonium. In support of a role for AmtA in ammonia homeostasis, AmtA mRNA is expressed throughout the life cycle, and its expression level increases during development. Importantly, AmtA-mediated ammonia homeostasis is critical for many developmental processes. amtA(-) cells are more sensitive to NH(4)Cl than wild-type cells in inhibition of chemotaxis toward cyclic AMP and of formation of multicellular aggregates. Furthermore, even in the absence of exogenously added ammonia, we found that amtA(-) cells produced many small fruiting bodies and that the viability and germination of amtA(-) spores were dramatically compromised. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that AmtA regulates ammonia homeostasis and plays important roles in multiple developmental processes in Dictyostelium.",

Therefore, the study of this process requires the use of a palette of techniques, which are continuously evolving and whose interpretation is not trivial. Here, we present the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> as a relevant model to study autophagy. Several methods have been developed based on the tracking and observation of autophagosomes by microscopy, analysis of changes in expression of autophagy genes and proteins, and examination of the autophagic flux with various techniques.

In addition, the conserved cytosolic domain of SibA interacts with talin, a well-characterized partner of mammalian integrins. Finally, genetic inactivation of SIBA affects adhesion to phagocytic particles, as well as cell adhesion and spreading on its substrate. It does not visibly alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, cellular migration or multicellular development.

In the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i>, previous studies have shown the existence of a DNA methyltransferase (DNMA) belonging to the DNMT2 family, but the extent and function of 5-methylcytosine in the genome are unclear. Here, we present the whole genome DNA methylation profile of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> using deep coverage replicate sequencing of bisulfite-converted gDNA extracted from post-starvation cells. We find an overall very low number of sites with any detectable level of DNA methylation, occurring at significant levels in only 303-3432 cytosines out of the \u223c7.5 million total cytosines in the genome depending on the replicate. Furthermore, a knockout of the DNMA enzyme leads to no overall decrease in DNA methylation. Of the identified sites, significant methylation is only detected at 11 sites in all four of the methylomes analyzed. Targeted bisulfite PCR sequencing and computational analysis demonstrate that the methylation profile does not change during development and that these 11 cytosines are most likely false positives generated by protection from bisulfite conversion due to their location in hairpin-forming palindromic DNA sequences. Our data therefore provide evidence that there is no significant DNA methylation in <i>Dictyostelium</i> before fruiting body formation and identify a reproducible experimental artifact from bisulfite sequencing.",

This developmental process is accompanied by massive changes in gene expression, which also affect non-coding RNAs. Here, we investigate how tRNAs as key regulators of the translation process are affected by this transition. To this end, we used LOTTE-seq to sequence the tRNA pool of <i>D. discoideum</i> at different developmental time points and analyzed both tRNA composition and tRNA modification patterns. We developed a workflow for the specific detection of modifications from reverse transcriptase signatures in chemically untreated RNA-seq data at single-nucleotide resolution. It avoids the comparison of treated and untreated RNA-seq data using reverse transcription arrest patterns at nucleotides in the neighborhood of a putative modification site as internal control. We find that nucleotide modification sites in <i>D. discoideum</i> tRNAs largely conform to the modification patterns observed throughout the eukaroytes. However, there are also previously undescribed modification sites. We observe substantial dynamic changes of both expression levels and modification patterns of certain tRNA types during fruiting body development. Beyond the specific application to <i>D. discoideum</i> our results demonstrate that the developmental variability of tRNA expression and modification can be traced efficiently with LOTTE-seq.",

Sub-stoichiometric binding of Rng2CHD also reduced the affinity between actin filaments and muscle myosin II carrying ADP and strongly inhibited the motility of actin filaments on myosin II in vitro. On skeletal muscle myosin II-coated surfaces, Rng2CHD stopped the actin movements at a binding ratio of 11%. Rng2CHD also inhibited actin movements on myosin II of the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i>, but in this case, by detaching actin filaments from myosin II-coated surfaces.

        "abstract": "The model species of social amoebae, Dictyostelium discoideum, has a compact genome consisting of about two thirds protein-coding regions, with intergenic regions that are rarely larger than 1,000 bp. We hypothesize that the haploid state of D. discoideum cells provides defense against the amplification of mobile elements whose transposition activities would otherwise lead to the accumulation of heterozygous, potentially lethal mutations in diploid populations. We further speculate that complex transposon clusters found on D. discoideum chromosomes do not a priori result from integration preferences of these transposons, but that the clusters instead result from negative selection against cells harboring insertional mutations in genes. D. discoideum cells contain a fraction of retrotransposons that are found in the close vicinity of tRNA genes. Growing evidence suggests that these retrotransposons use active recognition mechanisms to determine suitable integration sites. However, the question remains whether these retrotransposons also cause insertional mutagenesis of genes, resulting in their enrichment at tRNA genes, which are relatively safe sites in euchromatic regions. Recently developed in vivo retrotransposition assays will allow a detailed, genome-wide analysis of de novo integration events in the D. discoideum genome.",

        "abstract": "Amoeboid motility results from the cyclic repetition of shape changes leading to periodic oscillations of the cell length (motility cycle). We analyze the dominant modes of shape change and their association to the traction forces exerted on the substrate using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of time-lapse measurements of cell shape and traction forces in migrating Dictyostelium cells. Using wild-type cells (wt) as reference, we investigated Myosin II activity by studying Myosin II heavy chain null cells (mhcA-) and Myosin II essential light chain null cells (mlcE-). We found that wt, mlcE-and mhcA- cells utilize similar modes of shape changes during their motility cycle, although these shape changes are implemented at a slower pace in Myosin II null mutants. The number of dominant modes of shape changes is surprisingly few with only four modes accounting for 75% of the variance in all cases. The three principal shape modes are dilation/elongation, bending, and bulging of the front/back. The second mode, resulting from sideways protrusion/retraction, is associated to lateral asymmetries in the cell traction forces, and is significantly less important in mhcA- cells. These results indicate that the mechanical cycle of traction stresses and cell shape changes remains remarkably similar for all cell lines but is slowed down when myosin function is lost, probably due to a reduced control on the spatial organization of the traction stresses.",

        "abstract": "The actin cortex is very dynamic during migration of eukaryotes. In cells that use blebs as leading-edge protrusions, the cortex reforms beneath the cell membrane (bleb cortex) and completely disassembles at the site of bleb initiation. Remnants of the actin cortex at the site of bleb nucleation are referred to as the actin scar. We refer to the combined process of cortex reformation along with the degradation of the actin scar during bleb-based cell migration as <i>bleb stabilization</i>. The molecular factors that regulate the dynamic reorganization of the cortex are not fully understood. Myosin motor protein activity has been shown to be necessary for blebbing, with its major role associated with pressure generation to drive bleb expansion. Here, we examine the role of myosin in regulating cortex dynamics during bleb stabilization. Analysis of microscopy data from protein localization experiments in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells reveals a rapid formation of the bleb's cortex with a delay in myosin accumulation. In the degrading actin scar, myosin is observed to accumulate before active degradation of the cortex begins. Through a combination of mathematical modeling and data fitting, we identify that myosin helps regulate the equilibrium concentration of actin in the bleb cortex during its reformation by increasing its dissasembly rate. Our modeling and analysis also suggests that cortex degradation is driven primarily by an exponential decrease in actin assembly rate rather than increased myosin activity. We attribute the decrease in actin assembly to the separation of the cell membrane from the cortex after bleb nucleation.",

        "abstract": "Actin dynamics plays a crucial role in regulating essential cell functions and thereby is largely responsible to a considerable extent for cellular energy consumption. Certain pathological conditions in humans, like neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as well as variants of nemaline myopathy are associated with cytoskeletal abnormalities, so-called actin-cofilin rods. Actin-cofilin rods are aggregates consisting mainly of actin and cofilin, which are formed as a result of cellular stress and thereby help to ensure the survival of cells under unfavorable conditions. We have used <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, an established model system for cytoskeletal research to study formation and principles of cytoplasmic actin rod assembly in response to energy depletion. Experimentally, depletion of ATP was provoked by addition of either sodium azide, dinitrophenol, or 2-deoxy-glucose, and the formation of rod assembly was recorded by live-cell imaging. Furthermore, we show that hyperosmotic shock induces actin-cofilin rods, and that a drop in the intracellular pH accompanies this condition. Our data reveal that acidification of the cytoplasm can induce the formation of actin-cofilin rods to varying degrees and suggest that a local reduction in cellular pH may be a cause for the formation of cytoplasmic rods. We hypothesize that local phase separation mechanistically triggers the assembly of actin-cofilin rods and thereby influences the material properties of actin structures.",

        "abstract": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) is an important regulator of vesicle trafficking. By generating actin on the surface of intracellular vesicles, WASH is able to directly regulate endosomal sorting and maturation. We report that, in Dictyostelium, WASH is also required for the lysosomal digestion of both phagocytic and autophagic cargo. Consequently, Dictyostelium cells lacking WASH are unable to grow on many bacteria or to digest their own cytoplasm to survive starvation. WASH is required for efficient phagosomal proteolysis, and proteomic analysis demonstrates that this is due to reduced delivery of lysosomal hydrolases. Both protease and lipase delivery are disrupted, and lipid catabolism is also perturbed. Starvation-induced autophagy therefore leads to phospholipid accumulation within WASH-null lysosomes. This causes the formation of multilamellar bodies typical of many lysosomal storage diseases. Mechanistically, we show that, in cells lacking WASH, cathepsin D becomes trapped in a late endosomal compartment, unable to be recycled to nascent phagosomes and autophagosomes. WASH is therefore required for the maturation of lysosomes to a stage at which hydrolases can be retrieved and reused.",

        "abstract": "The Dot/Icm-translocated Ankyrin B (AnkB) F-box effector of Legionella pneumophila is essential for intra-vacuolar proliferation and functions as a platform for the docking of polyubiquitinated proteins to the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) within macrophages and ameba. Here we show that ectopically expressed AnkB in Dictyostelium discoideum is targeted to the plasma membrane where it recruits polyubiquitinated proteins and it trans-rescues the intracellular growth defect of the ankB null mutant, which has never been demonstrated for any effector in ameba. Using co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation we show specific interaction of Skp1 of D. discoideum with the F-box domain of AnkB, which has never been demonstrated in ameba. We show that anchoring of AnkB to the cytosolic face of the LCV membrane in D. discoideum is mediated by the host farnesylation of the C-terminal eukaryotic CaaX motif of AnkB and is independent of the F-box and the two ANK domains, which has never been demonstrated in ameba. Importantly, the three host farnesylation enzymes farnesyl transferase, RCE-1, and isoprenyl cysteine carboxyl methyl transferase of D. discoideum are recruited to the LCV in a Dot/Icm-dependent manner, which has never been demonstrated in ameba. We conclude that the polyubiquitination and farnesylation enzymatic machineries of D. discoideum are recruited to the LCV in a Dot/Icm-dependent manner and the AnkB effector exploits the two evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic machineries to proliferate within ameba, similar to mammalian cells. We propose that L. pneumophila has acquired ankB through inter-kingdom horizontal gene transfer from primitive eukaryotes, which facilitated proliferation of L. pneumophila within human cells and the emergence of Legionnaires' disease.",

        "abstract": "When cells are exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the Dictyostelium STAT orthologue STATc is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated. Previous observations suggest a non-paradigmatic mode of STAT activation, whereby stress-induced serine phosphorylation of the PTP3 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibits its activity towards STATc. We show that two serine residues in PTP3, S448 and S747, are rapidly phosphorylated after osmotic stress. cGMP is a second messenger for hyperosmotic stress response and 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane-permeable form of cGMP, is a known activator of STATc. GbpC, a cGMP-binding Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein, is a founder member of a protein family that includes LRRK2, the gene commonly mutated in familial Parkinson's disease. Genetic ablation of gbpC prevents STATc activation by 8-bromo-cGMP. However, osmotic-stress-induced activation of STATc occurs normally in the gbpC null mutant. Moreover, 8-bromo-cGMP does not stimulate phosphorylation of S448 and S747 of PTP3 in a wild-type strain. These facts imply the occurrence of redundant activation pathways. We present evidence that intracellular Ca(2+) is a parallel second messenger, by showing that agents that elevate intracellular Ca(2+) levels are potent STATc activators that stimulate phosphorylation of S448 and S747. We propose that stress-induced cGMP signalling exerts its stimulatory effect by potentiating the activity of a semi-constitutive tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates STATc, whereas parallel, stress-induced Ca(2+) signalling represses STATc dephosphorylation through its inhibitory effect on PTP3.",

        "abstract": "The abnormal accumulation of the tau protein into aggregates is a hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies. In normal conditions, tau binds off and on microtubules aiding in their assembly and stability dependent on the phosphorylation state of the protein. In disease-affected neurons, hyperphosphorylation leads to the accumulation of the tau protein into aggregates, mainly neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) which have been seen to colocalise with other protein aggregates in neurodegeneration. One such protein is \u03b1-synuclein, the main constituent of Lewy bodies (LB), a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In many neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, the colocalisation of tau and \u03b1-synuclein has been observed, suggesting possible interactions between the two proteins. To explore the cytotoxicity and interactions between these two proteins, we expressed full length human tau and \u03b1-synuclein in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> alone, and in combination. We show that tau is phosphorylated in <i>D. discoideum</i> and colocalises closely (within 40 nm) with tubulin throughout the cytoplasm of the cell as well as with \u03b1-synuclein at the cortex. Expressing wild type \u03b1-synuclein alone caused inhibited growth on bacterial lawns, phagocytosis and intracellular <i>Legionella</i> proliferation rates, but activated mitochondrial respiration and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The expression of tau alone impaired multicellular morphogenesis, axenic growth and phototaxis, while enhancing intracellular <i>Legionella</i> proliferation. Direct respirometric assays showed that tau impairs mitochondrial ATP synthesis and increased the \"proton leak,\" while having no impact on respiratory complex I or II function. In most cases depending on the phenotype, the coexpression of tau and \u03b1-synuclein exacerbated (phototaxis, fruiting body morphology), or reversed (phagocytosis, growth on plates, mitochondrial respiratory function, <i>Legionella</i> proliferation) the defects caused by either tau or \u03b1-synuclein expressed individually. Proteomics data revealed distinct patterns of dysregulation in strains ectopically expressing tau or \u03b1-synuclein or both, but down regulation of expression of cytoskeletal proteins was apparent in all three groups and most evident in the strain expressing both proteins. These results indicate that tau and \u03b1-synuclein exhibit different but overlapping patterns of intracellular localisation, that they individually exert distinct but overlapping patterns of cytotoxic effects and that they interact, probably physically in the cell cortex as well as directly or indirectly in affecting some phenotypes. The results show the efficacy of using <i>D. discoideum</i> as a model to study the interaction of proteins involved in neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "Efficient motility requires polarized cells, with pseudopods at the front and a retracting rear. Polarization is maintained by restricting the pseudopod catalyst, active Rac, to the front. Here, we show that the actin nucleation-promoting factor Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) contributes to maintenance of front-rear polarity by controlling localization and cellular levels of active Rac. Dictyostelium cells lacking WASP inappropriately activate Rac at the rear, which affects their polarity and speed. WASP's Cdc42 and Rac interacting binding (\"CRIB\") motif has been thought to be essential for its activation. However, we show that the CRIB motif's biological role is unexpectedly complex. WASP CRIB mutants are no longer able to restrict Rac activity to the front, and cannot generate new pseudopods when SCAR/WAVE is absent. Overall levels of Rac activity also increase when WASP is unable to bind to Rac. However, WASP without a functional CRIB domain localizes normally at clathrin pits during endocytosis, and activates Arp2/3 complex. Similarly, chemical inhibition of Rac does not affect WASP localization or activation at sites of endocytosis. Thus, the interaction between small GTPases and WASP is more complex than previously thought-Rac regulates a subset of WASP functions, but WASP reciprocally restricts active Rac through its CRIB motif.",

Rotenone is a known inducer of parkinsonian conditions in rats; we use rotenone to induce parkinsonian cellular conditions in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. In our model we primarily focus on mitochondrial dynamics. We found that rotenone disrupts the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton but mitochondrial morphology remains intact. Rotenone stimulates mitochondrial velocity while inhibiting mitochondrial fusion, increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) but has no effect on ATP levels. Antioxidants have been shown to decrease some PD symptoms thus we added ascorbic acid to our rotenone treated cells. Ascorbic acid administration suggests that rotenone effects may be specific to the disruption of the cytoskeleton rather than the increase in ROS. Our results imply that <i>D. discoideum</i> may be a valid cellular PD model and that the rotenone induced velocity increase and loss of fusion could prevent mitochondria from effectively providing energy and other mitochondrial products in high demand areas. The combination of these defects in mitochondrial dynamics and increased ROS could result in degeneration of neurons in PD.",

It is still not fully understood how eukaryotes sense and chemotax in response to chemoattractants with an enormous concentration range. A genetically traceable model organism, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, is the best-studied organism for GPCR-mediated chemotaxis. Recently, we have shown that C2GAP1 controls G protein coupled receptor-mediated Ras adaptation and chemotaxis. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism and the biological function of C2GAP1 membrane targeting for chemotaxis. We show that calcium and phospholipids on the plasma membrane play critical roles in membrane targeting of C2GAP1. Cells lacking C2GAP1 (<i>c2gapA</i> <sup>-</sup>) displayed an improved chemotaxis in response to chemoattractant gradients at subsensitive or low concentrations (<100 nM), while exhibiting impaired chemotaxis in response to gradients at high concentrations (>1 \u03bcM).

Gly146 is situated at the hinge between the two domains, and we previously showed that a G146V mutation leads to severe motility defects in skeletal myosin but has no effect on motility of myosin V. The present study tested the hypothesis that G146V mutation impaired rotation between the two domains, leading to such functional defects. First, our study showed that depolymerization of G146V filaments was slower than that of wild-type filaments. This result is consistent with the distinction of structural states of G146V filaments from those of the wild type, considering the recent report that stabilization of actin filaments involves rotation of the two domains. Next, we measured intramolecular FRET efficiencies between two fluorophores in the two domains with or without skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin or the heavy meromyosin equivalent of myosin V in the presence of ATP. Single-molecule FRET measurements showed that the conformations of actin subunits of control and G146V actin filaments were different in the presence of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin. This altered conformation of G146V subunits may lead to motility defects in myosin II. In contrast, distributions of FRET efficiencies of control and G146V subunits were similar in the presence of myosin V, consistent with the lack of motility defects in G146V actin with myosin V. The distribution of FRET efficiencies in the presence of myosin V was different from that in the presence of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin, implying that the roles of actin conformation in myosin motility depend on the type of myosin.",

Both knockdown and overexpression of Lis1 perturb phagocytosis, suggesting that Lis1 levels may be regulated during particle engulfment to facilitate remodeling of actin filaments within the phagocytic cup. This requirement of Lis1 is replicated in mouse macrophage cells as well as in the amoeba Dictyostelium, indicating an evolutionarily conserved role for Lis1 in phagocytosis. In support of these findings, Dictyostelium cells overexpressing Lis1 show defects in migration possibly caused by dysregulated actin. Taken together, Lis1 localizes to the phagocytic cup and influences the actin cytoskeleton in a manner that appears important for the uptake of solid particles into cells.",

We explored the pathogenic content of this harmful pathogen using a combination of DNA sequencing and insertional mutagenesis. The genome of this organism was sequenced using a strategy involving high-density pyrosequencing, a novel, rapid method of high-throughput sequencing. Excluding the rDNA repeats, the assembled genome is 3,976,746 base pairs (bp) and has 3830 ORFs. A significant fraction of ORFs (17.2%) are located in 28 putative alien islands, indicating that the genome has acquired a large amount of foreign DNA. Consistent with its role in pathogenesis, a remarkable number of the islands (16) contain genes implicated in virulence, indicating the organism devotes a considerable portion of its genes to pathogenesis. The largest island contains elements homologous to the Legionella/Coxiella Type IV secretion apparatus. Type IV secretion systems have been demonstrated to be important for virulence in other organisms and thus are likely to help mediate pathogenesis of A. baumannii. Insertional mutagenesis generated avirulent isolates of A. baumannii and verified that six of the islands contain virulence genes, including two novel islands containing genes that lacked homology with others in the databases. The DNA sequencing approach described in this study allows the rapid elucidation of the DNA sequence of any microbe and, when combined with genetic screens, can identify many novel genes important for microbial pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "We have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding a novel myosin II heavy chain kinase (mhckC) from Dictyostelium. Like other members of the myosin heavy chain kinase family, the mhckC gene product, MHCK C, has a kinase domain in its N-terminal half and six WD repeats in the C-terminal half. GFP-MHCK C fusion protein localized to the cortex of interphase cells, to the cleavage furrow of mitotic cells, and to the posterior of migrating cells. These distributions of GFP-MHCK C always corresponded with that of myosin II filaments and were not observed in myosin II-null cells, where GFP-MHCK C was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. Thus, localization of MHCK C seems to be myosin II-dependent. Cells lacking the mhckC gene exhibited excessive aggregation of myosin II filaments in the cleavage furrows and in the posteriors of the daughter cells once cleavage was complete. The cleavage process of these cells took longer than that of wild-type cells. Taken together, these findings suggest MHCK C drives the disassembly of myosin II filaments for efficient cytokinesis and recycling of myosin II that occurs during cytokinesis.",

        "abstract": "When multiple strains of microbes form social groups, such as the multicellular fruiting bodies of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, conflict can arise regarding cell fate. Both fixed and plastic differences among strains can contribute to cell fate, and plastic responses may be particularly important if social environments frequently change. We used RNA-sequencing and photographic time series analysis to detect possible conflict-induced plastic differences between wild <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> aggregates formed by single strains compared with mixed pairs of strains (chimeras). We found one hundred and two differentially expressed genes that were enriched for biological processes including cytoskeleton organization and cyclic AMP response (up-regulated in chimeras), and DNA replication and cell cycle (down-regulated in chimeras). In addition, our data indicate that in reference to a time series of multicellular development in the laboratory strain AX4, chimeras may be slightly behind clonal aggregates in their development. Finally, phenotypic analysis supported slower splitting of aggregates and a nonsignificant trend for larger group sizes in chimeras. The transcriptomic comparison and phenotypic analyses support discoordination among aggregate group members due to social conflict. These results are consistent with previously observed factors that affect cell fate decision in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> and provide evidence for plasticity in cAMP signaling and phenotypic coordination during development in response to social conflict in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> and similar microbial social groups.",

We report the discovery of a Ras signaling complex that includes the Ras guanine exchange factor (RasGEF) Aimless, RasGEFH, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and a scaffold designated Sca1. The Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex is recruited to the plasma membrane in a chemoattractant- and F-actin-dependent manner and is enriched at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells where it regulates F-actin dynamics and signal relay by controlling the activation of RasC and the downstream target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. In addition, PKB and PKB-related PKBR1 phosphorylate Sca1 and regulate the membrane localization of the Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex, and thereby RasC activity, in a negative feedback fashion. Thus, our study uncovered a molecular mechanism whereby RasC activity and the spatiotemporal activation of TORC2 are tightly controlled at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells.",

This leads to a fundamental question about the signaling processes: how does the signaling system operate under stochastic fluctuations or noise? Here, we report a stochastic model of chemotactic signaling in which noise and signal propagation along the transmembrane signaling pathway by chemoattractant receptors can be analyzed quantitatively. The results obtained from this analysis reveal that the second-messenger-production reactions by the receptors generate noisy signals that contain intrinsic noise inherently generated at this reaction and extrinsic noise propagated from the ligand-receptor binding. Such intrinsic and extrinsic noise limits the directional sensing ability of chemotactic cells, which may explain the dependence of chemotactic accuracy on chemical gradients that has been observed experimentally. Our analysis also reveals regulatory mechanisms for signal improvement in the stochastically operating signaling system by analyzing how the SNR of chemotactic signals can be improved on or deteriorated by the stochastic properties of receptors and second-messenger molecules. Theoretical consideration of noisy signal transduction by chemotactic signaling systems can further be applied to signaling systems in general.",

        "abstract": "mTORC1 and AMPK are mutually antagonistic sensors of nutrient and energy status that have been implicated in many human diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Starved cells of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> aggregate and eventually form fruiting bodies consisting of stalk cells and spores. We focus on how this bifurcation of cell fate is achieved. During growth mTORC1 is highly active and AMPK relatively inactive. Upon starvation, AMPK is activated and mTORC1 inhibited; cell division is arrested and autophagy induced. After aggregation, a minority of the cells (prestalk cells) continue to express much the same set of developmental genes as during aggregation, but the majority (prespore cells) switch to the prespore program. We describe evidence suggesting that overexpressing AMPK increases the proportion of prestalk cells, as does inhibiting mTORC1. Furthermore, stimulating the acidification of intracellular acidic compartments likewise increases the proportion of prestalk cells, while inhibiting acidification favors the spore pathway. We conclude that the choice between the prestalk and the prespore pathways of cell differentiation may depend on the relative strength of the activities of AMPK and mTORC1, and that these may be controlled by the acidity of intracellular acidic compartments/lysosomes (pHv), cells with low pHv compartments having high AMPK activity/low mTORC1 activity, and those with high pHv compartments having high mTORC1/low AMPK activity. Increased insight into the regulation and downstream consequences of this switch should increase our understanding of its potential role in human diseases, and indicate possible therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "While we have come to appreciate the architectural complexity of microbially synthesized secondary metabolites, far less attention has been paid to linking their structural features with possible modes of action. This is certainly the case with tropodithietic acid (TDA), a broad-spectrum antibiotic generated by marine bacteria that engage in dynamic symbioses with microscopic algae. TDA promotes algal health by killing unwanted marine pathogens; however, its mode of action (MoA) and significance for the survival of an algal-bacterial miniecosystem remains unknown. Using cytological profiling, we herein determine the MoA of TDA and surprisingly find that it acts by a mechanism similar to polyether antibiotics, which are structurally highly divergent. We show that like polyether drugs, TDA collapses the proton motive force by a proton antiport mechanism, in which extracellular protons are exchanged for cytoplasmic cations. The \u03b1-carboxy-tropone substructure is ideal for this purpose as the proton can be carried on the carboxyl group, whereas the basicity of the tropylium ion facilitates cation export. Based on similarities to polyether anticancer agents we have further examined TDA's cytotoxicity and find it to exhibit potent, broad-spectrum anticancer activities. These results highlight the power of MoA-profiling technologies in repurposing old drugs for new targets. In addition, we identify an operon that confers TDA resistance to the producing marine bacteria. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses of these genes lead to a previously unknown metabolic link between TDA/acid resistance and the \u03b3-glutamyl cycle. The implications of this resistance mechanism in the context of the algal-bacterial symbiosis are discussed.",

Nearly one third of the proteins trafficking through the secretory pathway are folded and matured in the ER. Additionally, it acts as calcium storage, and it is a main source for lipid biosynthesis. The ER is highly connected with other organelles through regions of membrane apposition that allow organelle remodeling, as well as lipid and calcium traffic. Cells are under constant changes due to metabolic requirements and environmental conditions that challenge the ER network&rsquo;s maintenance. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling pathway that restores homeostasis of this intracellular compartment upon ER stress conditions by reducing the load of proteins, and by increasing the processes of protein folding and degradation. Significant progress on the study of the mechanisms that restore ER homeostasis was achieved using model organisms such as yeast, <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and mammalian cells. In this review, we address the current knowledge on ER architecture and ER stress response in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>.

        "abstract": "<i>Aeromonas salmonicida</i> is a Gram-negative bacterium, known as a fish pathogen since its discovery. Although the species was initially considered psychrophilic, a mesophilic subspecies (<i>pectinolytica</i>) and many other mesophilic strains still not attributed to subspecies have been described in the last two decades. These mesophilic strains were sampled from various sources, including humans, and some of them are known to be pathogenic. In this study, we describe a strain, JF2480, which was isolated from the spleen, and also found the kidney and liver of a dead pied avocet (<i>Recurvirostra avosetta</i>), a type of migratory bird inhabiting aquatic environments. A core genome phylogenomic analysis suggests that JF2480 is taxonomically distant from other known <i>A.</i>&nbsp;<i>salmonicida</i> subspecies. The genome sequence confirms that the strain possesses key virulence genes that are present in the typical <i>A. salmonicida</i> psychrophilic subspecies, with the exception of the genes encoding the type three secretion system (T3SS). Bacterial virulence assays conducted on the surrogate host <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> amoeba confirmed that the strain is virulent despite the lack of T3SS. Bacterial growth curves showed that strain JF2480 grow well at 40 \u00b0C, the body temperature of the pied avocet, and even faster at 41 \u00b0C, compared to other mesophilic strains. Discovery of this strain further demonstrates the extent of the phylogenomic tree of this species. This study also suggests that <i>A. salmonicida</i> can infect a wider array of hosts than previously suspected and that we need to rethink the way we perceive <i>A. salmonicida</i>'s natural environment.",

Taking a reductionist approach to understand the molecular basis for these effects, a series of end-capped Thr-Pro dipeptides was synthesized, tracking the sequential post-translational modifications that occur in the protein. The conformation of the pyrrolidine ring in each compound was gauged via coupling constants ((3)JH\u03b1,H\u03b2) and the electronegativity of the C\u03b3-substituents by chemical shifts ((13)C). The equilibrium between the cis-trans conformations about the central prolyl peptide bond was investigated by integration of signals corresponding to the two species in the (1)H NMR spectra over a range of temperatures. These studies revealed an increasing preference for the trans-conformation in the order Pro < Hyp < [\u03b1-(1,4)GlcNAc]Hyp. Rates for the forward and reverse reactions, determined by magnetization transfer experiments, demonstrated a reduced rate for the trans-to-cis conversion and a significant increase in the cis-to-trans conversion upon hydroxylation of the proline residue in the dipeptide. NOE experiments suggest that the Thr side chain pushes the sugar away from the pyrrolidine ring. These effects, which depended on the presence of the N-terminal Thr residue, offer a mechanism to explain altered properties of the corresponding full-length proteins.",

We studied the effect of a bacterial endosymbiont on a facultatively multicellular social amoeba host.

Sentinel cells sequester and discard toxins from <i>D. discoideum</i> aggregates and may play a central role in defence against pathogens. We measured the number and functionality of sentinel cells in aggregates of <i>D. discoideum</i> infected by bacterial endosymbionts in the genus <i>Paraburkholderia</i>. Infected <i>D. discoideum</i> produced fewer and less functional sentinel cells, suggesting that <i>Paraburkholderia</i> may interfere with its host's immune system.

        "abstract": "Ketogenic diets have been utilized for many years to improve health, and as a dietary approach for the treatment of a range of diseases, where the mechanism of these low carbohydrate and high fat diets is widely considered to be through the production of metabolic products of fat breakdown, called ketones. One of these diets, the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet, involves high fat dietary intake in the form of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), decanoic and octanoic acid, and is commonly used in endurance and high intensity exercises but has also demonstrated beneficial effects in the treatment of numerous pathologies including drug resistant epilepsy, cancer, and diabetes. Recent advances, using <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> as a model, have controversially proposed several direct molecular mechanisms for decanoic acid in this diet, independent of ketone generation. Studies in this model have identified that decanoic acid reduces phosphoinositide turnover, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) activity, and also inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). These discoveries could potentially impact the treatment of a range of disorders including epilepsy, cancer and bipolar disorder. In this review, we summarize the newly proposed mechanisms for decanoic acid, identified using <i>D. discoideum</i>, and highlight potential roles in health and disease treatment.",

However, in non-metazoans, including yeasts, slime molds, and plants, Miro is primarily involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and homeostasis. Given the high level of conservation of Miro in eukaryotes and the variation in the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial transport between eukaryotic lineages, Miro may have a common ancestral function in mitochondria, and its roles in the regulation of mitochondrial transport may have been acquired specifically by metazoans after the evolutionary divergence of eukaryotes.",

Its short growth cycle and genetic tractability make it ideal for a variety of biochemical, cell biological, and biophysical assays. Dictyostelium have been widely used as a model of eukaryotic cell motility because the signaling and mechanical networks which they use to steer and produce forward motion are highly conserved. Because these migration networks consist of hundreds of interconnected proteins, perturbing individual molecules can have subtle effects or alter cell morphology and signaling in major unpredictable ways. Therefore, to fully understand this network, we must be able to quantitatively assess the consequences of abrupt modifications. This ability will allow us better control cell migration, which is critical for development and disease, <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we review recent advances in imaging, synthetic biology, and computational analysis which enable researchers to tune the activity of individual molecules in single living cells and precisely measure the effects on cellular motility and signaling. We also provide practical advice and resources to assist in applying these approaches in <i>Dictyostelium</i>.",

To characterize DIF-1 and its potential receptor(s), we synthesized two fluorescent derivatives of DIF-1, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-conjugated DIF-1 (DIF-1-BODIPY) and nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-conjugated DIF-1 (DIF-1-NBD), and investigated their biological activities and cellular localization. DIF-1-BODIPY (5\u2005\u00b5M) and DIF-1 (2\u2005nM) induced stalk cell differentiation in the DIF-deficient strain HM44 in the presence of cyclic adenosine monosphosphate (cAMP), whereas DIF-1-NBD (5\u2005\u00b5M) hardly induced stalk cell differentiation under the same conditions. Microscopic analyses revealed that the biologically active derivative, DIF-1-BODIPY, was incorporated by stalk cells at late stages of differentiation and was localized to mitochondria. The mitochondrial uncouplers carbonyl cyanide <i>m</i>-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), at 25-50\u2005nM, and dinitrophenol (DNP), at 2.5-5\u2005\u00b5M, induced partial stalk cell differentiation in HM44 in the presence of cAMP. DIF-1-BODIPY (1-2\u2005\u00b5M) and DIF-1 (10\u2005nM), as well as CCCP and DNP, suppressed chemotaxis in the wild-type strain Ax2 in shallow cAMP gradients.

        "abstract": "Migratory environments of various eukaryotic cells, such as amoeba, leukocytes and cancer cells, typically involve spatial confinement. Numerous studies have recently emerged, aimed to develop experimental platforms that better recapitulate the characteristics of the cellular microenvironment. Using microfluidic technologies, we show that increasing confinement of Dictyostelium discoideum cells into narrower micro-channels resulted in a significant change in the mode of migration and associated arrangement of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. We observed that cells tended to migrate at constant speed, the magnitude of which was dependent on the size of the channels, as was the locomotory strategy adopted by each cell. Two different migration modes were observed, pseudopod-based and bleb-based migration, with bleb based migration being more frequent with increasing confinement and leading to slower migration. Beside the migration mode, we found that the major determinants of cell speed are its protrusion rate, the amount of F-actin at its leading edge and the number of actin foci. Our results highlighted the impact of the microenvironments on cell behavior. Furthermore, we developed a novel quantitative movement analysis platform for mono-dimensional cell migration that allows for standardization and simplification of the experimental conditions and aids investigation of the complex and dynamic processes occurring at the single-cell level.",

The first step involves three separate PCR syntheses of a selectable marker cassette and the 5'- and 3'-regions of a target gene. Of the four primers used in amplification of the 5'- and 3'-regions of the target gene, two primers placed proximal to the site of the marker cassette are designed to have sequence tags complementary to the 5'- or 3'-side of the marker cassette. The two primers used in PCR synthesis of the marker cassette are complementary to the tagged primers. By fusion PCR, the 5' and 3' PCR products are linked to the marker cassette via the regions of tagged primers that overlap. A sufficient amount of the disruption construct can be directly amplified with the outermost primers. This method is simple, rapid and relatively inexpensive. In addition, there is the freedom of attaching long flanking regions to any selectable marker cassette.",

In this study, we report that starvation-induced secretion of Acb1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACBP orthologue, also requires GRASP (Grh1). This highlights the conserved function of GRASP in unconventional secretion. Although genes required for ER to Golgi or Golgi to cell surface transport are not required for Acb1 secretion in yeast, this process involves autophagy genes and the plasma membrane t-SNARE, Sso1. Inhibiting transport to vacuoles does not affect Acb1 secretion. In sum, our experiments reveal a unique secretory pathway where autophagosomes containing Acb1 evade fusion with the vacuole to prevent cargo degradation. We propose that these autophagosome intermediates fuse with recycling endosomes instead to form multivesicular body carriers that then fuse with the plasma membrane to release cargo.",

        "abstract": "Microbial communities are the simplest possible model of multicellular tissues, allowing studies of cell-cell interactions to be done with as few extraneous factors as possible. For instance, the eukaryotic microbe <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> proliferates as single cells, and when starved, the cells aggregate together and form structures of ~20,000 cells. The cells use a variety of signals to direct their movement, inform each other of their local cell density and whether they are starving, and organize themselves into groups of ~20,000 cells. Mathematical models and computational approaches have been a key check on, and guide of, the experimental work. In this minireview, I will discuss diffusion calculations and Monte Carlo simulations that were used for <i>Dictyostelium</i> studies that offer general paradigms for several aspects of cell-cell communication. For instance, computational work showed that diffusible secreted cell-density sensing (quorum) factors can diffuse away so quickly from a single cell that the local concentration will not build up to incorrectly cause the cell to sense that it is in the presence of a high density of other cells secreting that signal. In another example, computation correctly predicted a mechanism that allows a group of cells to break up into subgroups. These are thus some examples of the power and necessity of computational work in biology.",

However, the basic mechanisms by which mechanical forces (traction and resistive forces) are transmitted to the substrate, their magnitude and their location, are largely unknown. In this work, we performed detailed observations of cell movements by fluorescence microscopy using two-dimensional (2D) slugs. We show that 2D slugs share most of the properties of 3D ones. In particular, waves of movement propagate in long 2D slugs, and slug speed correlates with slug length as found in 3D slugs. We also present the first measurements of the distribution of forces exerted by 2D and 3D slugs using the elastic substrate method. Traction forces are mainly exerted in the central region of the slug. The large perpendicular forces around slug boundary and the existence of parallel resistive forces in the tip and/or the tail suggest an important role of the sheath in the transmission of forces to the substrate.",

We have previously demonstrated using a Dictyostelium model system that the Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (Dd-mrp4) gene expression is essential for the initiation of cell differentiation: Dd-mrp4-null cells fail to initiate differentiation, while the initial step of cell differentiation and the subsequent morphogenesis are markedly enhanced in mrp4 (OE) cells overexpressing the Dd-mrp4 in the extramitochondrial cytoplasm.

However, the biochemical function underlying this activity is unknown. Here, we determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of SidC, which has no structural homology to any protein. Sequence homology analysis revealed a potential canonical catalytic triad formed by Cys46, His444, and Asp446 on the surface of SidC. Unexpectedly, we found that SidC is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that uses the C-H-D triad to catalyze the formation of high-molecular-weight polyubiquitin chains through multiple ubiquitin lysine residues. A C46A mutation completely abolished the E3 ligase activity and the ability of the protein to recruit host ER proteins as well as polyubiquitin conjugates to the LCV. Thus, SidC represents a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase family important for phagosomal membrane remodeling by L. pneumophila.",

        "abstract": "SH2 domains are integral to many animal signaling pathways. By interacting with specific phosphotyrosine residues, they provide regulatable protein-protein interaction domains. Dictyostelium is the only nonmetazoan with functionally characterized SH2 domains, but the cognate tyrosine kinases are unknown. There are no orthologs of the animal tyrosine kinases, but there are very many tyrosine kinase-like kinases (TKLs), a group of kinases which, despite their family name, are classified mainly as serine-threonine kinases. STATs are transcription factors that dimerize via phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions. STATc is activated by phosphorylation on Tyr922 when cells are exposed to the prestalk inducer differentiation inducing factor (DIF-1), a chlorinated hexaphenone. We show that in a null mutant for Pyk2, a tyrosine-specific TKL, exposure to DIF-1 does not activate STATc. Conversely, overexpression of Pyk2 causes constitutive STATc activation. Pyk2 phosphorylates STATc on Tyr922 in vitro and complexes with STATc both in vitro and in vivo. This demonstration that a TKL directly activates a STAT has significant implications for understanding the evolutionary origins of SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine signaling. It also has mechanistic implications. Our previous work suggested that a predicted constitutive STATc tyrosine kinase activity is counterbalanced in vivo by the DIF-1-regulated activity of PTP3, a Tyr922 phosphatase. Here we show that the STATc-Pyk2 complex is formed constitutively by an interaction between the STATc SH2 domain and phosphotyrosine residues on Pyk2 that are generated by autophosphorylation. Also, as predicted, Pyk2 is constitutively active as a STATc kinase. This observation provides further evidence for this highly atypical, possibly ancestral, STAT regulation mechanism.",

        "abstract": "We present a computational method that predicts a pathway of residues that mediate protein allosteric communication. The pathway is predicted using only a combination of distance constraints between contiguous residues and evolutionary data. We applied this analysis to find pathways of conserved residues connecting the myosin ATP binding site to the lever arm. These pathway residues may mediate the allosteric communication that couples ATP hydrolysis to the lever arm recovery stroke. Having examined pre-stroke conformations of Dictyostelium, scallop, and chicken myosin II as well as Dictyostelium myosin I, we observed a conserved pathway traversing switch II and the relay helix, which is consistent with the understood need for allosteric communication in this conformation. We also examined post-rigor and rigor conformations across several myosin species. Although initial residues of these paths are more heterogeneous, all but one of these paths traverse a consistent set of relay helix residues to reach the beginning of the lever arm. We discuss our results in the context of structural elements and reported mutational experiments, which substantiate the significance of the pre-stroke pathways. Our method provides a simple, computationally efficient means of predicting a set of residues that mediate allosteric communication. We provide a refined, downloadable application and source code (on https://simtk.org) to share this tool with the wider community (https://simtk.org/home/allopathfinder).",

Consistent with previous electron and fluorescence microscopic studies, cofilin formed clusters along actin filaments, where the filaments were 2-nm thicker and the helical pitch was ~25% shorter, compared to control filaments. Interestingly, the shortened helical pitch was propagated to the neighboring bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster, while the pitch on the barbed-end side was similar to the control. Thus, cofilin clusters induce distinctively asymmetric conformational changes in filaments. Consistent with the idea that cofilin favors actin structures with a shorter helical pitch, cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally toward the pointed-end of the filament. Severing was often observed near the boundaries between bare zones and clusters, but not necessarily at the boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial division initiates at the site of a contractile Z-ring composed of polymerized FtsZ. The location of the Z-ring in the cell is controlled by a system of three mutually antagonistic proteins, MinC, MinD, and MinE. Plastid division is also known to be dependent on homologs of these proteins, derived from the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont that gave rise to plastids. In contrast, the mitochondria of model systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammals, and Arabidopsis thaliana seem to have replaced the ancestral \u03b1-proteobacterial Min-based division machinery with host-derived dynamin-related proteins that form outer contractile rings. Here, we show that the mitochondrial division system of these model organisms is the exception, rather than the rule, for eukaryotes. We describe endosymbiont-derived, bacterial-like division systems comprising FtsZ and Min proteins in diverse less-studied eukaryote protistan lineages, including jakobid and heterolobosean excavates, a malawimonad, stramenopiles, amoebozoans, a breviate, and an apusomonad. For two of these taxa, the amoebozoan Dictyostelium purpureum and the jakobid Andalucia incarcerata, we confirm a mitochondrial localization of these proteins by their heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The discovery of a proteobacterial-like division system in mitochondria of diverse eukaryotic lineages suggests that it was the ancestral feature of all eukaryotic mitochondria and has been supplanted by a host-derived system multiple times in distinct eukaryote lineages.",

This coordination is particularly prominent in organisms that undergo closed mitosis where centrosomes must not only respond to temporal signals, but also to spatial considerations, e.g. switching from the production of cytoplasmic microtubule arrays to the generation of dynamic intra-nuclear microtubules required for spindle assembly. We utilize a gene knockout of Kif9, a Dictyostelium discoideum Kin-I kinesin, to destabilize the physical association between centrosomes and the nuclear envelope. This approach presents a unique opportunity to reveal temporal and spatial components in the regulation of centrosomal activities in a closed-mitosis organism. Here we report that centrosome-nuclear engagement is not required for the entry into mitosis. Although detached centrosomes can duplicate in the cytoplasm, neither they nor nuclei alone can produce spindle-like microtubule arrays. However, the physical association of centrosomes and the nuclear envelope is required to progress through mitosis beyond prometaphase.",

Unfortunately, efforts to characterize the biological function of such modifications have been greatly hampered by the lack of affinity reagents that can differentiate protein glycoforms with robust affinity and specificity. In this work, we use a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based approach to generate and screen aptamers with indole-modified bases, which are capable of recognizing and differentiating between specific protein glycoforms. Using this approach, we were able to select base-modified aptamers that exhibit strong selectivity for specific glycoforms of two different proteins. These aptamers can discriminate between molecules that differ only in their glycan modifications, and can also be used to label glycoproteins on the surface of cultured cells. We believe our strategy should offer a generally-applicable approach for developing useful reagents for glycobiology research.",

        "abstract": "The abundant homohexameric AAA + ATPase p97 (also known as valosin-containing protein, VCP) is highly conserved from <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> to human and a pivotal factor of cellular protein homeostasis as it catalyzes the unfolding of proteins. Owing to its fundamental function in protein quality control pathways, it is regulated by more than 30 cofactors, including the UBXD protein family, whose members all carry an Ubiquitin Regulatory X (UBX) domain that enables binding to p97. One member of this latter protein family is the largely uncharacterized UBX domain containing protein 9 (UBXD9). Here, we analyzed protein-protein interactions of <i>D. discoideum</i> UBXD9 with p97 using a series of N- and C-terminal truncation constructs and probed the UBXD9 interactome in <i>D. discoideum</i>. Pull-down assays revealed that the UBX domain (amino acids 384-466) is necessary and sufficient for p97 interactions and that the N-terminal extension of the UBX domain, which folds into a \u03b2<sub>0</sub>-\u03b1<sub>-</sub> <sub>1</sub>-\u03b1<sub>0</sub> lariat structure, is required for the dissociation of p97 hexamers. Functionally, this finding is reflected by strongly reduced ATPase activity of p97 upon addition of full length UBXD9 or UBXD9<sup>261-573</sup>. Results from Blue Native PAGE as well as structural model prediction suggest that hexamers of UBXD9 or UBXD9<sup>261-573</sup> interact with p97 hexamers and disrupt the p97 subunit interactions via insertion of a helical lariat structure, presumably by destabilizing the p97 D1:D1' intermolecular interface. We thus propose that UBXD9 regulates p97 activity <i>in vivo</i> by shifting the quaternary structure equilibrium from hexamers to monomers. Using three independent approaches, we further identified novel interaction partners of UBXD9, including glutamine synthetase type III as well as several actin-binding proteins. These findings suggest a role of UBXD9 in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and are in line with the hypothesized oligomerization-dependent mechanism of p97 regulation.",

        "abstract": "We employed budding yeast and skeletal muscle actin to examine the contribution of the actin isoform to myosin motor function. While yeast and muscle actin are highly homologous, they exhibit different charge density at their N termini (a proposed myosin-binding interface). Muscle myosin-II actin-activated ATPase activity is significantly higher with muscle versus yeast actin. Whether this reflects inefficiency in the ability of yeast actin to activate myosin is not known. Here we optimized the isolation of two yeast myosins to assess actin function in a homogenous system. Yeast myosin-II (Myo1p) and myosin-V (Myo2p) accommodate the reduced N-terminal charge density of yeast actin, showing greater activity with yeast over muscle actin. Increasing the number of negative charges at the N terminus of yeast actin from two to four (as in muscle) had little effect on yeast myosin activity, while other substitutions of charged residues at the myosin interface of yeast actin reduced activity. Thus, yeast actin functions most effectively with its native myosins, which in part relies on associations mediated by its outer domain. Compared with yeast myosin-II and myosin-V, muscle myosin-II activity was very sensitive to salt. Collectively, our findings suggest differing degrees of reliance on electrostatic interactions during weak actomyosin binding in yeast versus muscle. Our study also highlights the importance of native actin isoforms when considering the function of myosins.",

Genotypes; however, are not the sole determinant of spore bias, but the relative role of genetic and plastic differences in evolutionary success is unclear. Here, we study chimeras composed of cells harvested in different phases of population growth. We show that such heterogeneity induces frequency-dependent, plastic variation in spore bias. In genetic chimeras, the magnitude of such variation is not negligible and can even reverse the classification of a strain's social behavior. Our results suggest that differential cell mechanical\u00a0properties can underpin, through biases emerging during aggregation, a \"lottery\" in strains' reproductive success that may counter the evolution of cheating.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease world-wide. Mutations in the multidomain protein Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of hereditary PD. Furthermore, recent data suggest that independent of mutations, increased kinase activity of LRRK2 plays an essential role in PD pathogenesis. Isolated mitochondria of tissue samples from PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations display a significant impairment of mitochondrial function. However, due to the complexity of the mitochondrial signaling network, the role of LRRK2 in mitochondrial metabolism is still not well understood. Previously we have shown that <i>D. discoideum</i> Roco4 is a suitable model to study the activation mechanism of LRRK2 <i>in vivo</i>. To get more insight in the LRRK2 pathways regulating mitochondrial activity we used this Roco4 model system in combination with murine RAW macrophages. Here we show that both <i>Dictyostelium roco4</i> knockout and cells expressing PD-mutants show behavioral and developmental phenotypes that are characteristic for mitochondrial impairment. Mitochondrial activity measured by Seahorse technology revealed that the basal respiration of <i>D. discoideum roco4-</i> cells is significantly increased compared to the WT strain, while the basal and maximal respiration values of cells overexpressing Roco4 are reduced compared to the WT strain. Consistently, LRRK2 KO RAW 264.7 cells exhibit higher maximal mitochondrial respiration activity compared to the LRRK2 parental RAW264.7 cells. Measurement on isolated mitochondria from LRRK2 KO and parental RAW 264.7 cells revealed no difference in activity compared to the parental cells. Furthermore, neither <i>D. discoideum roco4-</i> nor LRRK2 KO RAW 264.7 showed a difference in either the number or the morphology of mitochondria compared to their respective parental strains. This suggests that the observed effects on the mitochondrial respiratory in cells are indirect and that LRRK2/Roco proteins most likely require other cytosolic cofactors to elicit mitochondrial effects.",

In social amoebae, sex involves a promiscuous mixing of cytoplasm before zygotes consume the majority of cells, but for technical reasons, sexual progeny have been difficult to obtain and study. We report here genome-wide characterization of meiotic progeny in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> We find that recombination occurs at high frequency in pairwise crosses between all three mating types, despite the absence of the Spo11 enzyme that is normally required to initiate crossover formation. Fusions of more than two gametes to form transient syncytia lead to frequent triparental inheritance, with haploid meiotic progeny bearing recombined nuclear haplotypes from two parents and the mitochondrial genome from a third. Cells that do not contribute genetically to the <i>Dictyostelium</i> zygote nucleus thereby have a stake in the next haploid generation. <i>D. discoideum</i> mitochondrial genomes are polymorphic, and our findings raise the possibility that some of this variation might be a result of sexual selection on genes that can promote the spread of individual organelle genomes during sex.

        "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of genetically inherited Parkinson's Disease (PD). LRRK2 is a large, multi-domain protein belonging to the Roco protein family, a family of GTPases characterized by a central RocCOR (Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc) domain tandem. Despite the progress in characterizing the GTPase function of Roco proteins, there is still an ongoing debate concerning the working mechanism of Roco proteins in general, and LRRK2 in particular. This review consists of two parts. First, an overview is given of the wide evolutionary range of Roco proteins, leading to a variety of physiological functions. The second part focusses on the GTPase function of the RocCOR domain tandem central to the action of all Roco proteins, and progress in the understanding of its structure and biochemistry is discussed and reviewed. Finally, based on the recent work of our and other labs, a new working hypothesis for the mechanism of Roco proteins is proposed.",

        "abstract": "The real time visualisation of fluorescently tagged proteins in live cells using ever more sophisticated microscopes has greatly increased our understanding of the dynamics of key proteins during fundamental physiological processes such as cell locomotion, chemotaxis, cell division and membrane trafficking. In addition the fractionation of cells and isolation of organelles or known compartments can often verify any subcellular localisation and the use of tagged proteins as bait for the immunoprecipitation of material from cell fractions can identify specific binding partners and multiprotein complexes thereby helping assign a function to the tagged protein. We have successfully applied these techniques to the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> protein TSPOON that is part of an ancient heterohexamer membrane trafficking complex (Hirst <i>et al</i>., 2013). TSPOON is the product of the <i>tstD</i> gene in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and is not required for growth or the developmental cycle in this organism. <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae will exist in a vegetative phase where growth is sustained by the phagocytosis of bacteria. When this food source is spent they enter a developmental phase where the amoebae aggregate, via chemotaxis to extracellular waves of cAMP, into multicellular structures that subsequently form a fruiting body containing viable spores (Muller-Taubenberger <i>et al</i>., 2013). In the laboratory this cycle takes less than 24 h to complete and as a further aid to manipulation the requirement for a bacterial food source has been circumvented by the derivatisation of the wild type and isolation of axenic strains that can also grow in a nutrient rich broth. Axenic strains like Ax2 are the mainstay of laboratory research using <i>Dictyostelium</i> (Muller-Taubenberger <i>et al</i>., 2013). A description of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cell cultivation, the generation of cell lines that overexpress TSPOON-GFP and TSPOON null cells, and subsequent analysis (Muller-Taubenberger and Ishikawa-Ankerhold, 2013) is detailed below.",

Here, we report X-ray and electron microscopy (EM) structures of yeast dynein bound to different ATP analogs, which collectively provide insight into the roles of dynein's two major ATPase sites, AAA1 and AAA3, in the conformational change mechanism. ATP binding to AAA1 triggers a cascade of conformational changes that propagate to all six AAA domains and cause a large movement of the \"linker,\" dynein's mechanical element. In contrast to the role of AAA1 in driving motility, nucleotide transitions in AAA3 gate the transmission of conformational changes between AAA1 and the linker, suggesting that AAA3 acts as a regulatory switch. Further structural and mutational studies also uncover a role for the linker in regulating the catalytic cycle of AAA1. Together, these results reveal how dynein's two major ATP-binding sites initiate and modulate conformational changes in the motor domain during motility.",

In metazoans, the uniporter is a tightly regulated multicomponent system, including the pore-forming subunit MCU and several regulators (MICU1, MICU2, and Essential MCU REgulator, EMRE). The calcium-conducting activity of metazoan MCU requires the single-transmembrane protein EMRE. <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> (Dd), however, developed a simplified uniporter for which the pore-forming MCU (DdMCU) alone is necessary and sufficient for calcium influx. Here, we report a crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of DdMCU at 1.7 \u00c5 resolution. The DdMCU-NTD contains four helices and two strands arranged in a fold that is completely different from the known structures of other MCU-NTD homologues. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of DdMCU-NTD in solution indicated that the domain exists as high-order oligomers. Mutagenesis showed that the acidic residues Asp60, Glu72, and Glu74, which appeared to mediate the interface II, as observed in the crystal structure, participated in the self-assembly of DdMCU-NTD. Intriguingly, the oligomeric complex was disrupted in the presence of calcium. We propose that the calcium-triggered dissociation of NTD regulates the channel activity of DdMCU by a yet unknown mechanism.",

The GTPase domain is the most highly conserved region among dynamins. The globular structure contains the G-protein core fold, which is extended from a six-stranded beta-sheet to an eight-stranded one by a 55 amino acid insertion. This topologically unique insertion distinguishes dynamins from other subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. An additional N-terminal helix interacts with the C-terminal helix of the GTPase domain, forming a hydrophobic groove, which could be occupied by C-terminal parts of dynamin not present in our construct. The lack of major conformational changes between the nucleotide-free and the GDP-bound state suggests that mechanochemical rearrangements in dynamin occur during GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis or phosphate release and are not linked to loss of GDP.",

The results show that severing essentially always enhances actin polymerization by freeing up barbed ends, if barbed-end cappers are present. Severing has much weaker effects if only pointed-end cappers are present. In the early stages of polymerization, the polymerized-actin concentration grows exponentially as a function of time. The exponential growth rate is given in terms of the severing rate, and the latter is given in terms of the maximum slope in a polymerization time course.

The model is based on the dendritic-nucleation hypothesis for lamellipodial protrusion in nonmuscle cells such as keratocytes. We consider a set of partial differential equations for diffusion and reactions of sequestered actin complexes, nucleation, and growth by polymerization of barbed ends of actin filaments, as well as capping and depolymerization of the filaments. The mechanical aspect of protrusion is based on an elastic polymerization ratchet mechanism. An output of the model is a relationship between the protrusion velocity and the number of filament barbed ends pushing the membrane. Significantly, this relationship has a local maximum: too many barbed ends deplete the available monomer pool, too few are insufficient to generate protrusive force, so motility is stalled at either extreme. Our results suggest that to achieve rapid motility, some tuning of parameters affecting actin dynamics must be operating in the cell.",

To study the molecular mechanism of <i>Dd</i>DyP, highly pure and functional protein with a natively incorporated heme is required, however, obtaining a functional DyP-type peroxidase with a natively bound heme is challenging and often requires addition of expensive biosynthesis precursors. Alternatively, a heme <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution approach followed by a chromatographic purification step to remove the excess heme is often used. Here, we show that expressing the <i>Dd</i>DyP peroxidase in \u00d72 YT enriched medium at low temperature (20\u00b0C), without adding heme supplement or biosynthetic precursors, allows for a correct native incorporation of heme into the apo-protein, giving rise to a stable protein with a strong Soret peak at 402\u00a0nm. Further, we crystallized and determined the native structure of <i>Dd</i>DyP at a resolution of 1.95\u00a0\u00c5, which verifies the correct heme binding and its geometry. The structural analysis also reveals a binding of two water molecules at the distal site of heme plane bridging the catalytic residues (Arg239 and Asp149) of the GXXDG motif to the heme-Fe(III) via hydrogen bonds. Our results provide new insights into the geometry of native <i>Dd</i>DyP active site and its implication on DyP catalysis.",

Starving <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebas construct multicellular fruiting bodies with spores and stalk cells, with many Dictyostelia still able to encyst individually like their single-celled ancestors. While autophagy mostly occurs in the somatic stalk cells, autophagy gene knock-outs in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> ( <i>D. discoideum</i>) formed no spores and lacked cAMP induction of prespore gene expression. <b>Methods:</b> To investigate whether autophagy also prevents encystation, we knocked-out autophagy genes <i>atg5</i> and <i>atg7</i> in the dictyostelid <i>Polysphondylium pallidum</i>, which forms both spores and cysts. We measured spore and cyst differentiation and viability in the knock-out as well as stalk and spore gene expression and its regulation by cAMP. We tested a hypothesis that spores require materials derived from autophagy in stalk cells. Sporulation requires secreted cAMP acting on receptors and intracellular cAMP acting on PKA. We compared the morphology and viability of spores developed in fruiting bodies with spores induced from single cells by stimulation with cAMP and 8Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeant PKA agonist. <b>Results:</b> Loss of autophagy in <i>P. pallidum</i> reduced but did not prevent encystation. Stalk cells still differentiated but stalks were disorganised. However, no spores were formed at all \u00a0and cAMP-induced prespore gene expression was lost. <i>D. discoideum</i> spores induced <i>in vitro</i> by cAMP and 8Br-cAMP were smaller and rounder than spores formed multicellularly and while they were not lysed by detergent they germinated not (strain Ax2) or poorly (strain NC4), unlike spores formed in fruiting bodies. <b>Conclusions:</b> The stringent requirement of sporulation on both multicellularity and autophagy, which occurs mostly in stalk cells, suggests that stalk cells nurse the spores through autophagy. This highlights autophagy as a major cause for somatic cell evolution in early multicellularity.",

TRPML1 function is still being elucidated and a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of Mucolipidosis type IV, may facilitate development of potential treatments. We have created a model to study mucolipin function in the eukaryotic slime mould <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> by altering expression of its single mucolipin homologue, <i>mcln</i>. We show that in <i>Dictyostelium</i> mucolipin overexpression contributes significantly to global chemotactic calcium responses in vegetative and differentiated cells. Knockdown of mucolipin also enhances calcium responses in vegetative cells but does not affect responses in 6-7\u00a0h developed cells, suggesting that in developed cells mucolipin may help regulate local calcium signals rather than global calcium waves. We found that both knocking down and overexpressing mucolipin often, but not always, presented the same phenotypes. Altering mucolipin expression levels caused an accumulation or increased acidification of Lysosensor Blue stained vesicles in vegetative cells. Nutrient uptake by phagocytosis and macropinocytosis were increased but growth rates were not, suggesting defects in catabolism. Both increasing and decreasing mucolipin expression caused the formation of smaller slugs and larger numbers of fruiting bodies during multicellular development, suggesting that mucolipin is involved in initiation of aggregation centers. The fruiting bodies that formed from these smaller aggregates had proportionately larger basal discs and thickened stalks, consistent with a regulatory role for mucolipin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in the autophagic cell death pathways involved in stalk and basal disk differentiation in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. Thus, we have provided evidence that mucolipin contributes to chemotactic calcium signalling and that <i>Dictyostelium</i> is a useful model to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytopathogenesis of Mucolipidosis type IV.",

A large number of such translocated proteins have been identified, but few of these proteins are necessary for intracellular replication of the pathogen, making it difficult to correlate these genes with specific cell-biological events associated with L. pneumophila infection. We report here the identification and characterization of a family of two substrates, SidJ and SdjA, with distinctive phenotypes. In contrast to many Dot/Icm substrates, whose expression levels are elevated when bacteria are grown to postexponential phase, SidJ is produced at a constant rate during the entire bacterial growth cycle. Mutation in sidJ causes a significant growth defect in both macrophage and amoeba hosts, but an sdjA mutant is detectably defective only in protozoan hosts. However, in the amoeba host a mutant lacking both sidJ and sdjA does not display a more severe growth defect than the sidJ mutant. Despite its significant intracellular growth defect, the sidJ mutant is still able to effectively evade fusion with lysosomes. Importantly, recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins by vacuoles containing the sidJ mutant was considerably delayed in both mammalian and amoeba cells. Our results suggest that SidJ modulates host cellular pathways, contributing to the trafficking or retention of ER-derived vesicles to L. pneumophila vacuoles.",

        "abstract": "The cardiomyopathy (CM)-loop of the heavy chain of class-II myosins begins with a highly conserved Arg residue (whose mutation in human beta-cardiac myosin II results in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). The CM-loop of Dictyostelium myosin II (Arg397-Gln407) is essential for its biological functions and biochemical activities. We found that the CM-loop of smooth muscle myosin II substituted partially, and the CM-loop of beta-cardiac myosin II less well, for growth, capping of surface receptors and development, and the actin-activated MgATPase and in vitro motility activities of purified myosins. There was little correlation between the biochemical and biological activities of the two chimeras and 19 point mutants, but only the five mutants with k cat/K actin values equivalent to wild-type myosin supported essentially full biological function. The three point mutations of Arg397 equivalent to those that result in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in humans had minimal biological effects and different biochemical effects. The A400V mutation rendered full-length wild-type myosin almost completely inactive, both in vitro and in vivo, and the reverse V400A mutation in the cardiac CM-loop chimera restored almost full activity, even though the sequence still differed from wild-type in 7 of 11 positions. Transient kinetic studies of acto-subfragment-1 (S1) showed that the chimeras and the Ala/Val, Val/Ala mutations do not affect the equilibrium or the association and dissociation rate constants for either ATP or ADP binding to acto-S1 or the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of acto-S1. We conclude that the Ala/Val, Val/Ala mutations affect the release of Pi from acto-S1.ADP.Pi. In addition, Val at position 400 substantially reduces the affinity of actin for S1 in the absence of nucleotide.",

        "abstract": "Filopodia are actin-filled protrusions employed by cells to interact with their environment. Filopodia formation in Amoebozoa and Metazoa requires the phylogenetically diverse MyTH4-FERM (MF) myosins DdMyo7 and Myo10, respectively. While Myo10 is known to form antiparallel dimers, DdMyo7 lacks a coiled-coil domain in its proximal tail region, raising the question of how such divergent motors perform the same function. Here, it is shown that the DdMyo7 lever arm plays a role in both autoinhibition and function while the proximal tail region can mediate weak dimerization, and is proposed to be working in cooperation with the C-terminal MF domain to promote partner-mediated dimerization. Additionally, a forced dimer of the DdMyo7 motor is found to weakly rescue filopodia formation, further highlighting the importance of the C-terminal MF domain. Thus, weak dimerization activity of the DdMyo7 proximal tail allows for sensitive regulation of myosin activity to prevent inappropriate activation of filopodia formation. The results reveal that the principles of MF myosin-based filopodia formation are conserved via divergent mechanisms for dimerization.",

Here, we provide evidence that the Dictyostelium Ras subfamily protein RasB has a novel subcellular localization and function. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus during most of the cell cycle. Furthermore, during mitosis and cytokinesis RasB assumes a diffuse cellular localization despite the fact that the nuclear membrane stays intact. The linkage between the position of RasB in the cell and division suggests that it may have a role in nuclear division. Consistent with this idea, rasB- cells exhibit severe growth defects and cells overexpressing an activated version of RasB are multinucleate.",

In D. discoideum, tRNA gene-targeting retrotransposons have expanded to approximately 3\u00a0% of the genome.

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the formation of DNA-based extracellular traps (ETs) by neutrophils as an innate immune defense mechanism (1), hundreds of articles describe the involvement of ETs in physiological and pathological human and animal conditions [reviewed in Ref. (2), and the previous Frontiers Research Topic on NETosis: http://www.frontiersin.org/books/NETosis_At_the_Intersection_of_Cell_Biology_Microbiology_and_Immunology/195]. Interestingly, a few reports reveal that ETs can be formed by immune cells of more ancient organisms, as far back as the common ancestor of vertebrates and invertebrates (3). Recently, we reported that the Sentinel cells of the multicellular slug of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum also produce ETs to trap and kill slug-invading bacteria [see Box 1; and Figure 1 Ref. (4)]. This is a strong evidence that DNA-based cell-intrinsic defense mechanisms emerged much earlier than thought, about 1.3 billion years ago. Amazingly, using extrusion of DNA as a weapon to capture and kill uningestable microbes has its rationale. During the emergence of multicellularity, a primitive innate immune system developed in the form of a dedicated set of specialized phagocytic cells. This professionalization of immunity allowed the evolution of sophisticated defense mechanisms including the sacrifice of a small set of cells by a mechanism related to NETosis. This altruistic behavior likely emerged in steps, starting from the release of \"dispensable\" mitochondrial DNA by D. discoideum Sentinel cells. Grounded in this realization, one can anticipate that in the near future, many more examples of the invention and fine-tuning of ETs by early metazoan ancestors will be identified. Consequently, it can be expected that this more complete picture of the evolution of ETs will impact our views of the involvement and pathologies linked to ETs in human and animals.",

Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs) do not fuse with endosomes but recruit early secretory vesicles. Here we analyze the role of host cell phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism during uptake and intracellular replication of L. pneumophila. Genetic and pharmacological evidence suggests that class I phosphatidylinositol(3) kinases (PI3Ks) are dispensable for phagocytosis of wild-type L. pneumophila but inhibit intracellular replication of the bacteria and participate in the modulation of the LCV. Uptake and degradation of an icmT mutant strain lacking a functional Icm/Dot transporter was promoted by PI3Ks. We identified Icm/Dot-secreted proteins which specifically bind to phosphatidylinositol(4) phosphate (PI(4)P) in vitro and preferentially localize to LCVs in the absence of functional PI3Ks. PI(4)P was found to be present on LCVs using as a probe either an antibody against PI(4)P or the PH domain of the PI(4)P-binding protein FAPP1 (phosphatidylinositol(4) phosphate adaptor protein-1). Moreover, the presence of PI(4)P on LCVs required a functional Icm/Dot T4SS. Our results indicate that L. pneumophila modulates host cell PI metabolism and exploits the Golgi lipid second messenger PI(4)P to anchor secreted effector proteins to the LCV.",

Applying total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy at acquisition rates of 10-20 Hz, we measured an average growth rate of 3 microm.sec(-1) for filamentous actin structures throughout the entire substrate-attached cortex of Dictyostelium cells. New filaments often proceed along preexisting ones, resulting in bundle formation concurrent with filament growth. In cells that orientate in a gradient of chemoattractant, prominent assemblies of actin enriched in the Arp2/3 complex are inserted into the network, primarily at the base of filopods that point into the direction of the gradient. We propose that high turnover rates of actin filaments confer the plasticity to the cell cortex that is required for rapid accommodation to external stimuli.",

        "abstract": "The G146V mutation in actin is dominant lethal in yeast. G146V actin filaments bind cofilin only minimally, presumably because cofilin binding requires the large and small actin domains to twist with respect to one another around the hinge region containing Gly-146, and the mutation inhibits that twisting motion. A number of studies have suggested that force generation by myosin also requires actin filaments to undergo conformational changes. This prompted us to examine the effects of the G146V mutation on myosin motility. When compared with wild-type actin filaments, G146V filaments showed a 78% slower gliding velocity and a 70% smaller stall force on surfaces coated with skeletal heavy meromyosin. In contrast, the G146V mutation had no effect on either gliding velocity or stall force on myosin V surfaces. Kinetic analyses of actin-myosin binding and ATPase activity indicated that the weaker affinity of actin filaments for myosin heads carrying ADP, as well as reduced actin-activated ATPase activity, are the cause of the diminished motility seen with skeletal myosin. Interestingly, the G146V mutation disrupted cooperative binding of myosin II heads to actin filaments. These data suggest that myosin-induced conformational changes in the actin filaments, presumably around the hinge region, are involved in mediating the motility of skeletal myosin but not myosin V and that the specific structural requirements for the actin subunits, and thus the mechanism of motility, differ among myosin classes.",

Key to overcoming this limitation is the ability to prepare sufficiently thin samples. Cryosectioning can be used to prepare thin enough sections but suffers from severe artefacts, such as substantial compression. Here we describe a procedure, based upon focused ion beam (FIB) milling for the preparation of thin (200-500 nm) lamellae from vitrified cells grown on electron microscopy (EM) grids. The self-supporting lamellae are apparently free of distortions or other artefacts and open up large windows into the cell's interior allowing tomographic studies to be performed on any chosen part of the cell.

They have undergone extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT), gene duplication, and functional diversification and therefore offer an excellent paradigm to study protein evolution. We attempted to complement a <i>mep1</i>\u0394<i>mep2</i>\u0394<i>mep3</i>\u0394 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (triple-deletion strain), which otherwise cannot grow on ammonium as a sole nitrogen source at concentrations of <3\u2009mM, with <i>amtA</i> of Dictyostelium discoideum, an orthologue of S. cerevisiae <i>MEP2</i>. We observed that <i>amtA</i> did not complement the triple-deletion strain of S. cerevisiae for growth on low-ammonium medium. We isolated two mutant derivatives of <i>amtA</i> (<i>amtA M1</i> and <i>amtA M2</i>) from a PCR-generated mutant plasmid library that complemented the triple-deletion strain of S. cerevisiae. <i>amtA M1</i> bears three nonsynonymous and two synonymous substitutions, which are necessary for its functionality. <i>amtA M2</i> bears two nonsynonymous substitutions and one synonymous substitution, all of which are necessary for functionality. Interestingly, AmtA M1 transports ammonium but does not confer methylamine toxicity, while AmtA M2 transports ammonium and confers methylamine toxicity, demonstrating functional diversification. Preliminary biochemical analyses indicated that the mutants differ in their conformations as well as their mechanisms of ammonium transport. These intriguing results clearly point out that protein evolution cannot be fathomed by studying nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in isolation. The above-described observations have significant implications for various facets of biological processes and are discussed in detail. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Functional diversification following gene duplication is one of the major driving forces of protein evolution. While the role of nonsynonymous substitutions in the functional diversification of proteins is well recognized, knowledge of the role of synonymous substitutions in protein evolution is in its infancy. Using functional complementation, we isolated two functional alleles of the D. discoideum ammonium transporter gene (<i>amtA</i>), which otherwise does not function in S. cerevisiae as an ammonium transporters. One of them is an ammonium transporter, while the other is an ammonium transporter that also confers methylammonium (ammonium analogue) toxicity, suggesting functional diversification. Surprisingly, both alleles require a combination of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions for their functionality. These results bring out a hitherto-unknown pathway of protein evolution and pave the way for not only understanding protein evolution but also interpreting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).",

Dictyostelium has been used to study the interaction between phagocytes and bacteria because of its similarity to mammalian macrophages. In this study, we used a Dictyostelium model to investigate genes for resistance to phagocytosis in NTUH-K2044, a strain of K. pneumoniae causing pyogenic liver abscess that is highly resistant to phagocytosis. A total of 2,500 transposon mutants were screened by plaque assay, and 29 of them permitted phagocytosis by Dictyostelium. In the 29 mutants, six loci were identified; three were capsular synthesis genes. Of the other three, one was related to carnitine metabolism, one encoded a subunit of protease (clpX), and one encoded a lipopolysaccharide O-antigen transporter (wzm). Deletion and complementation of these genes showed that only \u0394clpX and \u0394wzm mutants became susceptible to Dictyostelium phagocytosis, and their complementation restored the phagocytosis resistance phenotype. These two mutants were also susceptible to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and revealed attenuated virulence in a mouse model, implying that they play important roles in the pathogenesis of K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, we demonstrated that clpP, which exists in an operon with clpX, was also involved in resistance to phagocytosis. The transcriptional profile of \u0394clpX was examined by microarray analysis and revealed a 3-fold lower level of expression of capsular synthesis genes. Therefore, we have identified genes involved in resistance to phagocytosis in K. pneumoniae using Dictyostelium, and this model is useful to explore genes associated with resistance to phagocytosis in heavily encapsulated bacteria.",

A field of starving amoebae first breaks up into territories. In each territory, the cells form a spider-like pattern of streams of cells. As part of a negative feedback loop, counting factor (CF), a secreted protein complex whose concentration increases with the size of the stream, prevents over-sized fruiting bodies from being formed by increasing cell motility and decreasing cell-cell adhesion, which causes the breakup of excessively large streams. Cells lacking the phosphatase CnrN (cnrN(-) cells) form small aggregation territories and few streams.1 In this report, we present computer simulations that suggest that in the absence of stream formation, CF should be unable to affect group size. As predicted, cnrN(-) group size is insensitive to the addition or depletion of CF. Together, the data indicate that CnrN regulates group size by regulating both the break-up of a field of cells into aggregation territories and stream formation during development, and that CnrN-mediated and CF-mediated group size regulation use different mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "The maturation pathways of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been delineated for plants and several animals, belonging to the evolutionary supergroups of Archaeplastida and Opisthokonta, respectively. Recently, we reported the discovery of the microprocessor complex in Dictyostelium discoideum of the Amoebozoa supergroup. The complex is composed of the Dicer DrnB and the dsRBD (double-stranded RNA binding domain) containing protein RbdB. Both proteins localize at nucleoli, where they physically interact, and both are required for miRNA maturation. Here we show that the miRNA phenotype of a \u0394drnB gene deletion strain can be rescued by ectopic expression of a series of DrnB GFP fusion proteins, which consistently showed punctate perinucleolar localization in fluorescence microscopy. These punctate foci appear surprisingly stable, as they persist both disintegration of nucleoli and degradation of cellular nucleic acids. We observed that DrnB expression levels influence the number of microprocessor foci and alter RbdB accumulation. An investigation of DrnB variants revealed that its newly identified nuclear localization signal is necessary, but not sufficient for the perinucleolar localization. Biogenesis of miRNAs, which are RNA Pol II transcripts, is correlated with that localization. Besides its bidentate RNase III domains, DrnB contains only a dsRBD, which surprisingly is dispensable for miRNA maturation. This dsRBD can, however, functionally replace the homologous domain in RbdB. Based on the unique setup of the Dictyostelium microprocessor with a subcellular localization similar to plants, but a protein domain composition similar to animals, we propose a model for the evolutionary origin of RNase III proteins acting in miRNA maturation.",

Within the completely sequenced Arabidopsis genome, we identified 38 expansin sequences that fall into three discrete subfamilies. Based on phylogenetic analysis and shared intron patterns, we propose a new, systematic nomenclature of Arabidopsis expansins. Further phylogenetic analysis, including expansin sequences found here in monocots, pine (Pinus radiata, Pinus taeda), fern (Regnellidium diphyllum, Marsilea quadrifolia), and moss (Physcomitrella patens) indicate that the three plant expansin subfamilies arose and began diversifying very early in, if not before, colonization of land by plants. Closely related \"expansin-like\" sequences were also identified in the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoidium, suggesting that these wall-modifying proteins have a very deep evolutionary origin.",

        "abstract": "Dynein is a huge multisubunit microtubule (MT)-based motor, whose motor domain resides in the heavy chain. The heavy chain comprises a ring of six AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) modules with two slender protruding domains, the tail and stalk. It has been proposed that during the ATP hydrolysis cycle, this tail domain swings against the AAA ring as a lever arm to generate the power stroke. However, there is currently no direct evidence to support the model that the tail swing is tightly linked to dynein motility. To address the question of whether the power stroke of the tail drives MT sliding, we devised an in vitro motility assay using genetically biotinylated cytoplasmic dyneins anchored on a glass surface in the desired orientation with a biotin-streptavidin linkage. Assays on the dyneins with the site-directed biotin tag at eight different locations provided evidence that robust MT sliding is driven by the power stroke of the tail. Furthermore, the assays revealed slow MT sliding independent of dynein orientation on the glass surface, which is mechanically distinct from the sliding driven by the power stroke of the tail.",

PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) is transiently generated by chemotactic stimulation and activates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge of migrating cells. In a recent study, we demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) directly binds to three members of the actin-based motor protein myosin I (myosin ID, IE and IF) in Dictyostelium discoideum and recruits these proteins to the plasma membrane of the leading edge. The PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-regulated membrane recruitment of myosin I induced chemoattractant-stimulated actin polymerization and was therefore required for chemotaxis. Similarly, human myosin IF was translocated to the plasma membrane through interactions with PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) upon chemotactic stimulation in a neutrophil cell line. Interestingly, we also found that the three PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-binding myosin I proteins function in phagocytosis, which involves both PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) signaling and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Our findings provide an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which class I myosin transmits PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) signals to the actin cytoskeleton.",

The mechanisms by which microbes bypass host iron restriction to gain access to this metal across the host vacuolar membrane are poorly characterized. In this work, we identify a unique intracellular iron acquisition strategy used by Legionella pneumophila. The bacterial Icm/Dot (intracellular multiplication/defect in organelle trafficking) type IV secretion system targets the bacterial-derived MavN (more regions allowing vacuolar colocalization N) protein to the surface of the Legionella-containing vacuole where this putative transmembrane protein facilitates intravacuolar iron acquisition. The \u0394mavN mutant exhibits a transcriptional iron-starvation signature before its growth is arrested during the very early stages of macrophage infection. This intracellular growth defect is rescued only by the addition of excess exogenous iron to the culture medium and not a variety of other metals. Consistent with MavN being a translocated substrate that plays an exclusive role during intracellular growth, the mutant shows no defect for growth in broth culture, even under severe iron-limiting conditions. Putative iron-binding residues within the MavN protein were identified, and point mutations in these residues resulted in defects specific for intracellular growth that are indistinguishable from the \u0394mavN mutant. This model of a bacterial protein inserting into host membranes to mediate iron transport provides a paradigm for how intravacuolar pathogens can use virulence-associated secretion systems to manipulate and acquire host iron.",

Recent structural studies have identified two states of switch 1 in G-proteins and myosin, but their role in the transduction mechanism has yet to be clarified. Single tryptophan residues were introduced into the switch 1 region of myosin II motor domain and studied by rapid reaction methods. We found that in the presence of MgADP, two states of switch 1 exist in dynamic equilibrium. Actin binding shifts the equilibrium towards one of the MgADP states, whereas ATP strongly favors the other. In the light of electron cryo-microscopic and X-ray crystallographic results, these findings lead to a specific structural model in which the equilibrium constant between the two states of switch 1 is coupled to the strength of the actin-myosin interaction. This has implications for the enzymatic mechanism of G-proteins and possibly P-loop NTPases in general.",

Rap- GAP3 transiently and rapidly translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation and localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells. Here, we examined localization of truncated RapGAP3 proteins and found that the I/LWEQ domain in the central region of RapGAP3 was sufficient for posterior localization in migrating cells, as opposed to leading-edge localization of full-length Rap- GAP3. All truncated proteins accumulated at the leading edge of migrating cells exhibited clear translocation to the cell cortex in response to stimulation, whereas proteins localized to the posterior in migrating cells displayed no translocation to the cortex. The I/LWEQ domain appears to passively accumulate at the posterior region in migrating cells due to exclusion from the extended front region in response to chemoattractant stimulation rather than actively being localized to the back of cells. Our results suggest that posterior localization of the I/LWEQ domain of RapGAP3 is likely related to F-actin, which has probably different properties compared to newly formed F-actin at the leading edge of migrating cells, at the lateral and posterior regions of the cell.",

        "abstract": "The effective migration of amoeboid cells requires a fine regulation of cell-substratum adhesion. These entwined processes have been shown to be regulated by a host of biophysical and biochemical cues. Here, we reveal the pivotal role played by calcium-based mechanosensation in the active regulation of adhesion resulting in a high migratory adaptability. Using mechanotactically driven Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we uncover the existence of optimal mechanosensitive conditions-corresponding to specific levels of extracellular calcium-for persistent directional migration over physicochemically different substrates. When these optimal mechanosensitive conditions are met, noticeable enhancement in cell migration directionality and speed is achieved, yet with significant differences among the different substrates. In the same narrow range of calcium concentrations that yields optimal cellular mechanosensory activity, we uncovered an absolute minimum in cell-substratum adhesion activity, for all considered substrates, with differences in adhesion strength among them amplified. The blocking of the mechanosensitive ion channels with gadolinium-i.e., the inhibition of the primary mechanosensory apparatus-hampers the active reduction in substrate adhesion, thereby leading to the same undifferentiated and drastically reduced directed migratory response. The adaptive behavioral responses of Dictyostelium cells sensitive to substrates with varying physicochemical properties suggest the possibility of novel surface analyses based on the mechanobiological ability of mechanosensitive and guidable cells to probe substrates at the nanometer-to-micrometer level.",

Here, we report experimental evidence that in a mutated <i>D. discoideum</i> cell line with increased Ras activity, switches between two distinct migratory modes, the amoeboid and fan-shaped type of locomotion, can even spontaneously occur within the same cell. We observed and characterized repeated and reversible switchings between the two modes of locomotion, suggesting that they are distinct behavioral traits that coexist within the same cell.

Here, we have used cryo-EM to determine 3D maps of native flagellar dynein-c and a cytoplasmic dynein motor domain in different nucleotide states. The structures show key sites of conformational change within the AAA+ ring and a large rearrangement of the \"linker\" domain, involving a hinge near its middle. Analysis of a mutant in which the linker \"undocks\" from the ring indicates that linker remodeling requires energy that is supplied by interactions with the AAA+ modules. Fitting the dynein-c structures into flagellar tomograms suggests how this mechanism could drive sliding between microtubules, and also has implications for cytoplasmic cargo transport.",

Based on previous analyses of fast and slow elongating VASP proteins by in vitro total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and kinetic and thermodynamic measurements, we established a kinetic model of Ena/VASP-mediated actin filament elongation. At steady state, it entails that tetrameric VASP uses one of its arms to processively track growing filament barbed ends while three G-actin-binding sites (GABs) on other arms are available to recruit and deliver monomers to the filament tip, suggesting that VASP operates as a single tetramer in solution or when clustered on a surface, albeit processivity and resistance toward capping protein (CP) differ dramatically between both conditions. Here, we tested the model by variation of the oligomerization state and by increase of the number of GABs on individual polypeptide chains. In excellent agreement with model predictions, we show that in solution the rates of filament elongation directly correlate with the number of free GABs. Strikingly, however, irrespective of the oligomerization state or presence of additional GABs, filament elongation on a surface invariably proceeded with the same rate as with the VASP tetramer, demonstrating that adjacent VASP molecules synergize in the elongation of a single filament. Additionally, we reveal that actin ATP hydrolysis is not required for VASP-mediated filament assembly. Finally, we show evidence for the requirement of VASP to form tetramers and provide an amended model of processive VASP-mediated actin assembly in clustered arrays.",

        "abstract": "Aggregative multicellularity relies on cooperation among formerly independent cells to form a multicellular body. Previous work with Dictyostelium discoideum showed that experimental evolution under low relatedness profoundly decreased cooperation, as indicated by the loss of fruiting body formation in many clones and an increase of cheaters that contribute proportionally more to spores than to the dead stalk. Using whole-genome sequencing and variant analysis of these lines, we identified 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 29 genes. Each gene had 1 variant except for grlG (encoding a G protein-coupled receptor), which had 10 unique SNPs and 5 structural variants. Variants in the 5' half of grlG-the region encoding the signal peptide and the extracellular binding domain-were significantly associated with the loss of fruiting body formation; the association was not significant in the 3' half of the gene. These results suggest that the loss of grlG was adaptive under low relatedness and that at least the 5' half of the gene is important for cooperation and multicellular development. This is surprising given some previous evidence that grlG encodes a folate receptor involved in predation, which occurs only during the single-celled stage. However, non-fruiting mutants showed little increase in a parallel evolution experiment where the multicellular stage was prevented from happening. This shows that non-fruiting mutants are not generally selected by any predation advantage but rather by something-likely cheating-during the multicellular stage.",

        "abstract": "Shear flow-induced migration is an important physiological phenomenon experienced by multiple cell types, including leukocytes and cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and directionally migrate in response to mechanical perturbation are not well understood. <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> social amoeba, a well-established model for studying amoeboid-type migration, also exhibits directional motility when exposed to shear flow, and this behavior is preceded by rapid and transient activation of the same signal transduction network that is activated by chemoattractants. The initial response, which can also be observed following brief 2 s stimulation with shear flow, requires an intact actin cytoskeleton; however, what aspect of the cytoskeletal network is responsible for sensing and/or transmitting the signal is unclear. We investigated the role of actin crosslinkers filamin and \u03b1-actinin by analyzing initial shear flow-stimulated responses in cells with or without these proteins. Both filamin and \u03b1-actinin showed rapid and transient relocalization from the cytosol to the cortex following shear flow stimulation. Using spatiotemporal analysis of Ras GTPase activation as a readout of signal transduction network activity, we demonstrated that lack of \u03b1-actinin did not reduce, and, in fact, slightly improved the response to acute mechanical stimulation compared to cells expressing \u03b1-actinin. In contrast, shear flow-induced Ras activation was significantly more robust in filamin-null cells rescued with filamin compared to cells expressing empty vector. Reduced responsiveness appeared to be specific to mechanical stimuli and was not due to a change in the basal activity since response to global stimulation with a chemoattractant and random migration was comparable between cells with or without filamin. Finally, while filamin-null cells rescued with filamin efficiently migrated upstream when presented with continuous flow, cells lacking filamin were defective in directional migration. Overall, our study suggests that filamin, but not \u03b1-actinin, is involved in sensing and/or transmitting mechanical stimuli that drive directed migration; however, other components of the actin cytoskeleton likely also contribute to the initial response since filamin-null cells were still able to activate the signal transduction network. These findings could have implications for our fundamental understanding of shear flow-induced migration of leukocytes, cancer cells and other amoeboid-type cells.",

Although pgtA-null cells, whose Skp1 contains only a single sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or GlcNAc), show wild-type O(2) dependence of culmination, cells lacking AgtA, an alpha3-galactosyltransferase required to extend the trisaccharide, require elevated O(2) as for P4H1-null cells. Skp1 is the only detectable protein modified by purified PgtA added to pgtA-null extracts. The basis for specificity of PgtA was investigated using native Skp1 acceptor glycoforms and a novel synthetic peptide containing GlcNAcalpha1,4-hydroxy(trans)proline. Cysteine-alkylation of Skp1 strongly inhibited modification by the PgtA galactosyltransferase but not the fucosyltransferase. Furthermore, native and synthetic Skp1 glycopeptides were poorly galactosylated, not processively fucosylated, and negligibly inhibitory, whereas the fucosyltransferase was active toward small substrates. In addition, the galactosyltransferase exhibited an atypical concentration dependence on UDP-galactose. The results provide the first evidence that Skp1 is the functional target of P4H1 in O(2) regulation, indicate a gatekeeper function for the beta3-galactosyltransferase in the PgtA dual reaction, and identify an unexpected P4H1-dependent yet antagonistic function for PgtA that is reversed by AgtA.",

        "abstract": "A seesaw-like movement of the relay region upon the recovery step of myosin was recently simulated in silico. In this model the relay helix tilts around its pivoting point formed by a phenylalanine cluster (Phe(481), Phe(482), and Phe(652)), which moves the lever arm of myosin. To study the effect of the elimination of the proposed pivoting point, these phenylalanines were mutated to alanines in two Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain constructs (M(F481A, F482A) and M(F652A)). The relay movement was followed by the fluorescence change of Trp(501) located in the relay region. The steady-state and transient kinetic fluorescence experiments showed that the lack of the phenylalanine fulcrum perturbs the formation of the \"up\" lever arm state, and only moderate effects were found in the nucleotide binding, the formation of the \"down\" lever arm position, and the ATP hydrolysis steps. We conclude that the lack of the fulcrum decouples the distal part of the relay from the nucleotide binding site upon the recovery step. Our molecular dynamics simulations also showed that the conformation of the motor is not perturbed by the mutation in the down lever arm state, however, the lack of the pivoting point rearranges the dynamic pattern of the kink region of the relay helix.",

The environmental bacterium replicates in free-living amoebae as well as in lung macrophages in a distinct compartment, the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole (LCV). The LCV communicates with a number of cellular vesicle trafficking pathways and is formed by a plethora of secreted bacterial effector proteins, which target host cell proteins and lipids. Phosphoinositide (PI) lipids are pivotal determinants of organelle identity, membrane dynamics and vesicle trafficking. Accordingly, eukaryotic cells tightly regulate the production, turnover, interconversion, and localization of PI lipids. <i>L. pneumophila</i> modulates the PI pattern in infected cells for its own benefit by (i) recruiting PI-decorated vesicles, (ii) producing effectors acting as PI interactors, phosphatases, kinases or phospholipases, and (iii) subverting host PI metabolizing enzymes. The PI conversion from PtdIns(3)<i>P</i> to PtdIns(4)<i>P</i> represents a decisive step during LCV maturation. In this review, we summarize recent progress on elucidating the strategies, by which <i>L. pneumophila</i> subverts host PI lipids to promote LCV formation and intracellular replication.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of dynein fragments in Dictyostelium induces the movement of the entire interphase microtubule array. Centrosomes in these cells circulate through the cytoplasm at rates between 0.4 and 2.5 microm/s and are trailed by a comet-tail like arrangement of the microtubule array. Previous work suggested that these cells use a dynein-mediated pulling mechanism to generate this dramatic movement and that similar forces are at work to maintain the interphase MTOC position in wild-type cells. In the present study, we address the nature of the forces used to produce microtubule movement. We have used a laser microbeam to sever the connection between the motile centrosomes and trailing microtubules, demonstrating that the major force for such motility results from a pushing on the microtubules. We eliminate the possibility that microtubule assembly/disassembly reactions are significant contributors to this motility and suggest that the cell cortex figures prominently in locating force-producing molecules. Our findings indicate that interphase microtubules in Dictyostelium are subject to both dynein- and kinesin-like forces and that these act in concert to maintain centrosome position in the cell and to support the radial character of the microtubule network.",

        "abstract": "Structural rearrangements of the myosin upper-50 kD subdomain are thought to play a key role in coordinating actin binding with nucleotide hydrolysis during the myosin ATPase cycle. Such rearrangements could open and close the active site in opposition to the actin-binding cleft, helping explain the opposing affinities of myosin for actin and nucleotide. To directly examine conformational changes across the active site during the ATPase cycle we have genetically engineered a mutant of chicken smooth-muscle myosin, F344W motor domain essential light chain, which contains a single tryptophan (344W) located on a short loop between two alpha helixes that traverse the upper-50 kD subdomain in front of the active site. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was examined between the 344W donor probe and 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) (mant)-nucleotide acceptor probes in the active site of this construct. The observed fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies were 6.4% in the presence of mant ADP and 23.8% in the presence of mant ATP, corresponding to distances of 33.4 A and 24.9 A, respectively. Our results are consistent with structural rearrangements in which there is an 8.5-A closure between the 344W residue and the mant moiety during the transition from the strongly (ADP) to weakly (ATP) actin-bound states of the myosin ATPase cycle.",

        "abstract": "The social amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum undergoes a developmental sequence wherein an extracellular matrix (ECM) sheath surrounds a group of differentiating cells. This sheath is comprised of proteins and carbohydrates, like the ECM of mammalian tissues. One of the characterized ECM proteins is the cysteine-rich, EGF-like (EGFL) repeat-containing, calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein (CaMBP) CyrA. The first EGFL repeat of CyrA increases the rate of random cell motility and cyclic AMP-mediated chemotaxis. Processing of full-length CyrA (~63 kDa) releases two major EGFL repeat-containing fragments (~45 kDa and ~40 kDa) in an event that is developmentally regulated. Evidence for an EGFL repeat receptor also exists and downstream intracellular signaling pathways involving CaM, Ras, protein kinase A and vinculin B phosphorylation have been characterized. In total, these results identify CyrA as a true matricellular protein comparable in function to tenascin C and other matricellular proteins from mammalian cells. Insight into the regulation and processing of CyrA has also been revealed. CyrA is the first identified extracellular CaMBP in this eukaryotic microbe. In keeping with this, extracellular CaM (extCaM) has been shown to be present in the ECM sheath where it binds to CyrA and inhibits its cleavage to release the 45 kDa and 40 kDa EGFL repeat-containing fragments. The presence of extCaM and its role in regulating a matricellular protein during morphogenesis extends our understanding of CaM-mediated signal transduction in eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "In eukaryotes with the universal genetic code a single class I release factor (eRF1) most probably recognizes all stop codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) and is essential for termination of nascent peptide synthesis. It is well established that stop codons have been reassigned to amino acid codons at least three times among ciliates. The codon specificities of ciliate eRF1s must have been modified to accommodate the variant codes. In this study we have amplified, cloned and sequenced eRF1 genes of two hypotrichous ciliates, Oxytricha trifallax (UAA and UAG for Gln) and Euplotes aediculatus (UGA for Cys). We also sequenced/identified three protist and two archaeal class I RF genes to enlarge the database of eRF1/aRF1s with the universal code. Extensive comparisons between universal code eRF1s and those of Oxytricha, Euplotes, and Tetrahymena which represent three lineages that acquired variant codes independently, provide important clues to identify stop codon-binding regions in eRF1. Domain 1 in the five ciliate eRF1s, particularly the TASNIKS heptapeptide and its adjacent region, differs significantly from domain 1 in universal code eRF1s. This observation suggests that domain 1 contains the codon recognition site, but that the mechanism of eRF1 codon recognition may be more complex than proposed by Nakamura et al. or Knight and Landweber.",

Enzymes belonging to the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family produce superoxide in a regulated manner. We have identified three distinct NOX subfamilies in the fungal kingdom and have shown that NoxA is required for sexual cell differentiation in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we show that Neurospora crassa NOX-1 elimination results in complete female sterility, decreased asexual development, and reduction of hyphal growth. The lack of NOX-2 did not affect any of these processes but led instead to the production of sexual spores that failed to germinate, even in the presence of exogenous oxidants. The elimination of NOR-1, an ortholog of the mammalian Nox2 regulatory subunit gp67(phox), also caused female sterility, the production of unviable sexual spores, and a decrease in asexual development and hyphal growth. These results indicate that NOR-1 is required for NOX-1 and NOX-2 functions at different developmental stages and establish a link between NOX-generated ROS and the regulation of growth. Indeed, NOX-1 was required for the increased asexual sporulation previously observed in mutants without catalase CAT-3. We also analyzed the function of the penta-EF calcium-binding domain protein PEF-1 in N. crassa. Deletion of pef-1 resulted in increased conidiation but, in contrast to what occurs in Dictyostelium discoideum, the mutation of this peflin did not suppress the phenotypes caused by the lack of NOX-1. Our results support the role of ROS as critical cell differentiation signals and highlight a novel role for ROS in regulation of fungal growth.",

Previous in vitro studies have shown that a Dictyostelium relative of UNC-104 transports liposomes containing acidic phospholipids, but whether this interaction is needed for the recognition and transport of synaptic vesicles in metazoans remains unexplored. Here, we have introduced mutations in the nonmotor domain of UNC-104 and examined whether these mutant motors can rescue an unc-104 Caenorhabditis elegans strain. We show that a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in UNC-104 is essential for membrane transport in living C. elegans, that this PH domain binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)), and that point mutants in the PH domain that interfere with PI(4,5)P(2) binding in vitro also interfere with UNC-104 function in vivo. Several other lipid-binding modules could not effectively substitute for the UNC-104 PH domain in this in vivo assay. Real time imaging also revealed that a lipid-binding point mutation in the PH domain reduced movement velocity and processivity of individual UNC-104::GFP punctae in neurites. These results reveal a critical role for PI(4,5)P(2) binding in UNC-104-mediated axonal transport and shows that the cargo-binding properties of the distal PH domain can affect motor output.",

The gtaG<sup>-</sup> phenotype is cell-autonomous in prestalk cells and non-cell-autonomous in prespore cells. Transcriptome analyses reveal that GtaG regulates prestalk gene expression during cell differentiation before culmination and is required for progression into culmination. GtaG-dependent genes include genetic suppressors of the Dd-STATa-defective phenotype as well as Dd-STATa target-genes, including extra cellular matrix genes. We show that GtaG may be involved in the production of two culmination-signaling molecules, cyclic di-GMP and the spore differentiation factor SDF-1 and that addition of c-di-GMP rescues the gtaG<sup>-</sup> culmination and spore formation deficiencies.

Mutations in LRRK2 have been found to be thus far the most frequent cause of late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Several of the pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 result in decreased GTPase activity and enhanced kinase activity, suggesting a possible PD-related gain of abnormal function. Important progress in the structural understanding of LRRK2 has come from our work with related Roco proteins from lower organisms. Atomic structures of Roco proteins from prokaryotes revealed that Roco proteins belong to the GAD class of molecular switches (G proteins activated by nucleotide dependent dimerization). As in LRRK2, PD-analogous mutations in Roco proteins from bacteria decrease the GTPase reaction. Studies with Roco proteins from the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum revealed that PD mutants have different effects and most importantly they explained the G2019S-related increased LRRK2 kinase activity. Furthermore, the structure of Dictyostelium Roco4 kinase in complex with the LRRK2 inhibitor H1152 showed that Roco4 and other Roco family proteins can be important for the optimization of the current, and identification of new, LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. In this review we highlight the recent progress in structural and biochemical characterization of Roco proteins and discuss its implication for the understanding of the complex regulatory mechanism of LRRK2.",

In the present study, 29 P. aeruginosa isolates from dental unit waterlines and CF patients were collected and their genetic and phenotypes profiles were compared to determine whether environmental and clinical isolates are related. The isolates were first classified using the random amplified polymorphic DNA method. This made it possible to distribute the isolates into one clinical cluster and two environmental clusters. The isolates in the environmental cluster that were genetically closer to the clinical cluster also displayed phenotypes similar to the clinical isolates. The isolates from the second environmental cluster displayed opposite phenotypes, particularly an increased capacity to form biofilms. The isolates in this cluster were also the only ones harboring genes that encoded specific epimerases involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides, which could explain their increased ability to form biofilms. In conclusion, the isolates from the dental unit waterlines could be distributed into two clusters, with some of the environmental isolates resembled the clinical isolates.",

        "abstract": "The contractile actin cortex is a thin layer of filamentous actin, myosin motors, and regulatory proteins beneath the plasma membrane crucial to cytokinesis, morphogenesis, and cell migration. However, the factors regulating actin assembly in this compartment are not well understood. Using the <i>Dictyostelium</i> model system, we show that the three Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) ForA, ForE, and ForH are regulated by the RhoA-like GTPase RacE and synergize in the assembly of filaments in the actin cortex. Single or double formin-null mutants displayed only moderate defects in cortex function whereas the concurrent elimination of all three formins or of RacE caused massive defects in cortical rigidity and architecture as assessed by aspiration assays and electron microscopy. Consistently, the triple formin and RacE mutants encompassed large peripheral patches devoid of cortical F-actin and exhibited severe defects in cytokinesis and multicellular development. Unexpectedly, many <i>forA</i><sup><i>-</i></sup> /<i>E</i><sup>-</sup>/<i>H</i><sup>-</sup> and <i>racE</i><sup><i>-</i></sup> mutants protruded efficiently, formed multiple exaggerated fronts, and migrated with morphologies reminiscent of rapidly moving fish keratocytes. In 2D-confinement, however, these mutants failed to properly polarize and recruit myosin II to the cell rear essential for migration. Cells arrested in these conditions displayed dramatically amplified flow of cortical actin filaments, as revealed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging and iterative particle image velocimetry (PIV). Consistently, individual and combined, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of genes encoding mDia1 and -3 formins in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells revealed enhanced frequency of cells displaying multiple fronts, again accompanied by defects in cell polarization and migration. These results suggest evolutionarily conserved functions for formin-mediated actin assembly in actin cortex mechanics.",

As excess PIP3 signaling is a hallmark of many cancers, its suppression through activation of PTEN is a potential cancer intervention. Using a heterologous expression system in which human PTEN-GFP is expressed in Dictyostelium cells, we identified mutations in the membrane-binding regulatory interface that increase the recruitment of PTEN to the plasma membrane due to enhanced association with PI(4,5)P2. We engineered these into an enhanced PTEN (ePTEN) with approximately eightfold increased ability to suppress PIP3 signaling. Upon expression in human cells, ePTEN decreases PIP3 levels in the plasma membrane; phosphorylation of AKT, a major downstream event in PIP3 signaling; and cell proliferation and migration. Thus, the activation of PTEN can readjust PIP3 signaling and may serve as a feasible target for anticancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "Skp1 is hydroxylated by an O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylase (PhyA) that contributes to O2-sensing in the social amoeba Dictyostelium and the mammalian pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. HO-Skp1 is subject to glycosylation and the resulting pentasaccharide affects Skp1 conformation in a way that influences association of Skp1 with F-box proteins, and potentially the assembly of E3(SCF) ubiquitin ligase complexes that mediate the polyubiquitination of target proteins that are degraded in the 26S-proteasome. To investigate the conservation and specificity of these modifications, we analyzed proteins from the oomycete Pythium ultimum, an important crop plant pathogen. Putative coding sequences for Pythium's predicted PhyA and first glycosyltransferase in the predicted five-enzyme pathway, a GlcNAc-transferase (Gnt1), predict a bifunctional enzyme (Phgt) that, when expressed in Dictyostelium, rescued a knockout of phyA but not gnt1. Though recombinant Phgt was also unable to glycosylate Dictyostelium HO-Skp1, it could hydrolyze UDP-GlcNAc and modify a synthetic hydroxypeptide from Dictyostelium Skp1. Pythium encodes two highly similar Skp1 isoforms, but only Skp1A was efficiently hydroxylated and glycosylated in vitro. While kinetic analysis revealed no evidence for processive processing of Skp1, the physical linkage of the two activities implies dedication to Skp1 in vivo. These findings indicate a widespread occurrence of the Skp1 modification pathway across protist phylogeny, suggest that both Gnt1 and PhyA are specific for Skp1 and indicate that the second Skp1 provides a bypass mechanism for O2-regulation in Pythium and other protists that conserve this gene.",

In dynein, these sites are separated by a long coiled coil stalk that must mediate communication between them, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that changes in registration between the two helices of the coiled coil can perform this function. We locked the coiled coil at three specific registrations using oxidation to disulfides of paired cysteine residues introduced into the two helices. These trapped ATPase activity either in a microtubule-independent high or low state, and microtubule binding activity either in an ATP-insensitive strong or weak state, depending on the registry of the coiled coil. Our results provide direct evidence that dynein uses sliding between the two helices of the stalk to couple ATPase and microtubule binding activities during its mechanochemical cycle.",

        "abstract": "Actomyosin is an important molecular motor, and the binding of actin and myosin is an essential research target in biophysics. Nevertheless, the physical factors driving or opposing the binding are still unclear. Here, we investigate the role of water in actin-myosin binding using the most reliable statistical-mechanical method currently available for assessing biomolecules immersed in water. This method is characterized as follows: water is treated not as a dielectric continuum but as an ensemble of molecules; the polyatomic structures of proteins are taken into consideration; and the binding free energy is decomposed into physically insightful entropic and energetic components by accounting for the hydration effect to its full extent. We find that the actin-myosin binding brings large gains of electrostatic and Lennard-Jones attractive interactions. However, these gains are accompanied by even larger losses of actin-water and myosin-water electrostatic and LJ attractive interactions. Although roughly half of the energy increase due to the losses is cancelled out by the energy decrease arising from structural reorganization of the water released upon binding, the remaining energy increase is still larger than the energy decrease brought by the gains mentioned above. Hence, the net change in system energy is positive, which opposes binding. Importantly, the binding is driven by a large gain of configurational entropy of water, which surpasses the positive change in system energy and the conformational entropy loss occurring for actin and myosin. The principal physical origin of the large water-entropy gain is as follows: the actin-myosin interface is closely packed with the achievement of high shape complementarity on the atomic level, leading to a large increase in the total volume available to the translational displacement of water molecules in the system and a resultant reduction of water crowding (i.e., entropic correlations among water molecules).",

        "abstract": "Contraction of the cortical actin cytoskeleton underlies both rear retraction in directed cell migration and cytokinesis. Here, we show that talin, a central component of focal adhesions, has a major role in these processes. We found that Dictyostelium talin A colocalized with myosin II in the rear of migrating cells and the cleavage furrow. During directed cell migration, talin A-null cells displayed a long thin tail devoid of actin filaments, whereas additional depletion of SibA, a transmembrane adhesion molecule that binds to talin A, reverted this phenotype, suggesting a requirement of the link between actomyosin and SibA by talin A for rear retraction. Disruptions of talin A also resulted in detachment of the actomyosin contractile ring from the cell membrane and concomitant regression of the cleavage furrow under certain conditions. The C-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) of talin A exhibited a localization pattern identical to that of full-length talin A. The N-terminal FERM domain was found to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] in vitro. In vivo, however, PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is known to activate talin, is believed to be enriched in the rear of migrating cells and the cleavage furrow in Dictyostelium. From these results, we propose that talin A activated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the cell posterior or cleavage furrow links actomyosin cytoskeleton to adhesion molecules or other membrane proteins, and that the force is transmitted through these links to retract the tail during cell migration or to cause efficient ingression of the equator during cytokinesis.",

        "abstract": "A number of methods have recently been published that use phylogenetic information extracted from large multiple sequence alignments to detect sites that have changed properties in related protein families. In this study we use such methods to assess functional divergence between eukaryotic EF-1alpha (eEF-1alpha), archaebacterial EF-1alpha (aEF-1alpha) and two eukaryote-specific EF-1alpha paralogs-eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) and Hsp70 subfamily B suppressor 1 (HBS1). Overall, the evolutionary modes of aEF-1alpha, HBS1 and eRF3 appear to significantly differ from that of eEF-1alpha. However, functionally divergent (FD) sites detected between aEF-1alpha and eEF-1alpha only weakly overlap with sites implicated as putative EF-1beta or aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) binding residues in EF-1alpha, as expected based on the shared ancestral primary translational functions of these two orthologs. In contrast, FD sites detected between eEF-1alpha and its paralogs significantly overlap with the putative EF-1beta and/or aa-tRNA binding sites in EF-1alpha. In eRF3 and HBS1, these sites appear to be released from functional constraints, indicating that they bind neither eEF-1beta nor aa-tRNA. These results are consistent with experimental observations that eRF3 does not bind to aa-tRNA, but do not support the 'EF-1alpha-like' function recently proposed for HBS1. We re-assess the available genetic data for HBS1 in light of our analyses, and propose that this protein may function in stop codon-independent peptide release.",

We found that a predicted structure of AprA has similarity to human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). DPPIV is a serine protease present in extracellular fluids that cleaves peptides with a proline or alanine in the second position. In Insall chambers, DPPIV gradients below, similar to, and above the human serum DPPIV concentration cause movement of human neutrophils away from the higher concentration of DPPIV. A 1% DPPIV concentration difference between the front and back of the cell is sufficient to cause chemorepulsion. Neutrophil speed and viability are unaffected by DPPIV. DPPIV inhibitors block DPPIV-mediated chemorepulsion. In a murine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspirated bleomycin induces a significant increase in the number of neutrophils in the lungs after 3 d. Oropharyngeal aspiration of DPPIV inhibits the bleomycin-induced accumulation of mouse neutrophils. These results indicate that DPPIV functions as a chemorepellent of human and mouse neutrophils, and they suggest new mechanisms to inhibit neutrophil accumulation in acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

The involvement of these residues in the catalytic mechanism is consistent with yeast genetics studies. This work highlights both structural and mechanistic similarities with the small and trimeric G proteins and restricts the types of mechanisms responsible for the considerable enhancement of ATP hydrolysis associated with actin polymerization.

        "abstract": "The power stroke pulling myosin along actin filaments during muscle contraction is achieved by a large rotation ( approximately 60 degrees ) of the myosin lever arm after ATP hydrolysis. Upon binding the next ATP, myosin dissociates from actin, but its ATPase site is still partially open and catalytically off. Myosin must then close and activate its ATPase site while returning the lever arm for the next power stroke. A mechanism for this coupling between the ATPase site and the distant lever arm is determined here by generating a continuous series of optimized intermediates between the crystallographic end-states of the recovery stroke. This yields a detailed structural model for communication between the catalytic and the force-generating regions that is consistent with experimental observations. The coupling is achieved by an amplifying cascade of conformational changes along the relay helix lying between the ATPase and the domain carrying the lever arm.",

A microtubule- and cyclic AMP-mediated fusion of acidocalcisomes to the contractile vacuole complex in T. cruzi results in translocation of aquaporin and the resulting water movement which, in addition to swelling of acidocalcisomes, is responsible for the volume reversal not accounted for by efflux of osmolytes.

        "abstract": "Chemotaxis is crucial for many physiological processes including the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of infection, trafficking of lymphocytes in the human body, and metastasis of cancer cells. A family of small proteins, chemokines, serves as the signals, and a family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) detects chemokines and direct cell migration. One of the basic questions in chemotaxis of eukaryotes is how a GPCR transduces signals to control the assembly of the actin network that generates directional force for cell migration. Over the past decade, a variety of signaling components have been implicated to transduce the GPCR signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. Studies in a lower eukaryotic organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, have allowed us to discover evolutionary conversed components involved in the GPCR-controlled actin network during chemotaxis. However, complete pathways linking GPCR to the actin network are still far from clear. Here we first summarize the previous studies on these components, and then update with our finding showing a new pathway, consisting of a GPCR, G\u03b2\u03b3, Elmo/Dock, Rac and Arp2/3 and actin. We suggest that this pathway serves as a direct linkage between the GPCR/G-protein, the chemoattractant sensing machinery, and the actin cytoskeleton, the machinery of cell movement during chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic protein sequences often contain amino-acid homopolymers that consist of a single amino acid repeated from several to dozens of times. Some of these are functional but others may persist largely because of high expansion rates due to DNA slippage. However, very long homopolymers with over a hundred repeats are very rare. We report an extraordinarily long homopolymer consisting of 306 tandem serine repeats from the single-celled eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, which also has a multicellular stage. The gene has a paralog with 132 repeats and orthologs, also with high serine repeat numbers, in various other Dictyostelid species. The conserved gene structure and protein sequences suggest that the homopolymer is functional. The high codon diversity and very poor alignment of serine codons in this gene between species similarly indicate functionality. This is because the serine homopolymer is conserved despite much DNA sequence change. A survey of other very long amino-acid homopolymers in eukaryotes shows that high codon diversity is the rule, suggesting that these too may be functional.",

        "abstract": "In facultative symbioses, only a fraction of hosts are associated with a symbiont. Understanding why specific host and symbiont strains are associated can inform us of the evolutionary forces affecting facultative symbioses. Possibilities include ongoing host-symbiont coevolution driven by reciprocal selection, or priority effects that are neutral in respect to the host-symbiont interaction. We hypothesized that ongoing host-symbiont coevolution would lead to higher fitness estimates for naturally co-occurring (native) host and symbiont combinations compared to nonnative combinations. We used the <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> - <i>Paraburkholderia bonniea</i> system to test this hypothesis. <i>P. bonniea</i> features a reduced genome size relative to another <i>Paraburkholderia</i> symbiont of <i>D. discoideum</i>, indicating a significant history of coevolution with its host. Facultative symbionts may experience continued genome reduction if coevolution is ongoing, or their genome size may have reached a stable state if the symbiosis has also stabilized. Our work demonstrates that ongoing coevolution is unlikely for <i>D. discoideum</i> and <i>P. bonniea.</i> The system instead represents a stable facultative symbiosis. Specifically associated host and symbiont strains in this system are the result of priority effects, and presently unassociated hosts are simply uncolonized. We find evidence for a virulence-transmission trade-off without host strain specificity, and identify candidate virulence factors in the genomes of <i>P. bonniea</i> strains that may contribute to variation in benevolence.",

        "abstract": "During chemotaxis, receptors and heterotrimeric G-protein subunits are distributed and activated almost uniformly along the cell membrane, whereas PI(3,4,5)P(3), the product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), accumulates locally at the leading edge. The key intermediate event that creates this strong PI(3,4,5)P(3) asymmetry remains unclear. Here, we show that Ras is rapidly and transiently activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation and regulates PI3K activity. Ras activation occurs at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells, and this local activation is independent of the F-actin cytoskeleton, whereas PI3K localization is dependent on F-actin polymerization. Inhibition of Ras results in severe defects in directional movement, indicating that Ras is an upstream component of the cell's compass. These results support a mechanism by which localized Ras activation mediates leading edge formation through activation of basal PI3K present on the plasma membrane and other Ras effectors required for chemotaxis. A feedback loop, mediated through localized F-actin polymerization, recruits cytosolic PI3K to the leading edge to amplify the signal.",

Here we describe a general method for the detection of a protein domain of interest in any species for which a complete proteome exists. In particular, we apply this approach to identify histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) domain-containing proteins across a range of eukaryotic species. From the sequences of known HPt domains, we created an amino acid occurrence matrix which we then used to define a conserved, probabilistic motif. Examination of various organisms either known to contain (plant and fungal species) or believed to lack (mammals) HPt domains established criteria by which new HPt candidates were identified and ranked. Search results using a probabilistic motif matrix compare favorably with data to be found in several commonly used protein structure/function databases: our method identified all known HPt proteins in the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome, confirmed the absence of such motifs in mice and humans, and suggests new candidate HPts in several organisms. Moreover, probabilistic motif searching can be applied more generally, in a manner both readily customized and computationally compact, to other protein domains; this utility is demonstrated by our identification of histones in a range of eukaryotic organisms.",

Here we explore a link between the nearly invariant nature of the modes that describe functional dynamics at the mesoscopic level and the large evolutionary sequence variations at the residue level. By using a structural perturbation method (SPM), which probes the residue-specific response to perturbations (or mutations), we identify a sparse network of strongly conserved residues that transmit allosteric signals in three structurally unrelated biological nanomachines, namely, DNA polymerase, myosin motor, and the Escherichia coli chaperonin. Based on the response of every mode to perturbations, which are generated by interchanging specific sequence pairs in a multiple sequence alignment, we show that the functionally relevant low-frequency modes are most robust to sequence variations. Our work shows that robustness of dynamical modes at the mesoscopic level is encoded in the structure through a sparse network of residues that transmit allosteric signals.",

        "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is widely studied for its multicellular development program as a response to starvation. Aggregates of up to 10 (6) cells form fruiting bodies containing (i) dormant spores (~80%) that can persist for months in the absence of nutrients, and (ii) dead stalk cells (~20%) that promote the dispersion of the spores towards nutrient-rich areas. It is often overlooked that not all cells aggregate upon starvation. Using a new quantitative approach based on time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and a low ratio of reporting cells, we have quantified this fraction of non-aggregating cells. In realistic starvation conditions, up to 15% of cells do not aggregate, which makes this third cell fate a significant component of the population-level response of social amoebae to starvation. Non-aggregating cells have an advantage over cells in aggregates since they resume growth earlier upon arrival of new nutrients, but have a shorter lifespan under prolonged starvation. We find that phenotypic heterogeneities linked to cell nutritional state bias the representation of cells in the aggregating vs. non-aggregating fractions, and thus affect population partitioning. Next, we report that the fraction of non-aggregating cells depends on genetic factors that regulate the timing of starvation, signal sensing efficiency and aggregation efficiency. In addition, interactions between clones in mixtures of non-isogenic cells affect the partitioning of each clone into both fractions. We further build a numerical model to test the evolutionary significance of the non-aggregating cell fraction. The partitioning of cells into aggregating and non-aggregating fractions is optimal in fluctuating environments with an unpredictable duration of starvation periods. Our study highlights the unicellular component of the response of social amoebae to starvation, and thus extends its evolutionary and ecological framework.",

These two major signaling events are visualized by biosensors in a crescent-like zone at the plasma membrane. Here, we show that a Dictyostelium Rho GTPase, RacE, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GxcT, stabilize the orientation of Ras activation and PIP3 production in response to chemoattractant gradients, and this regulation occurred independently of the actin cytoskeleton and cell polarity. Cells lacking RacE or GxcT fail to persistently direct Ras activation and PIP3 production toward chemoattractants, leading to lateral pseudopod extension and impaired chemotaxis. Constitutively active forms of RacE and human RhoA are located on the portion of the plasma membrane that faces lower concentrations of chemoattractants, opposite of PIP3 production. Mechanisms that control the localization of the constitutively active form of RacE require its effector domain, but not PIP3. Our findings reveal a critical role for Rho GTPases in positioning Ras activation and thereby establishing the accuracy of directional sensing.",

        "abstract": "Separation of somatic cells from germ-line cells is a crucial event for multicellular organisms, but how this step was achieved during evolution remains elusive. In Dictyostelium discoideum and many other dictyostelid species, solitary amoebae gather and form a multicellular fruiting body in which germ-line spores and somatic stalk cells differentiate, whereas in Acytostelium subglobosum, acellular stalks form and all aggregated amoebae become spores. In this study, because most D. discoideum genes known to be required for stalk cell differentiation have homologs in A. subglobosum, we inferred functional variations in these genes and examined conservation of the stalk cell specification cascade of D. discoideum mediated by the polyketide differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) in A. subglobosum. Through heterologous expression of A. subglobosum orthologs of DIF-1 biosynthesis genes in D. discoideum, we confirmed that two of the three genes were functional equivalents, while DIF-methyltransferase (As-dmtA) involved at the final step of DIF-1 synthesis was not. In fact, DIF-1 activity was undetectable in A. subglobosum lysates and amoebae of this species were not responsive to DIF-1, suggesting a lack of DIF-1 production in this species. On the other hand, the molecular function of an A. subglobosum ortholog of DIF-1 responsive transcription factor was equivalent with that of D. discoideum and inhibition of polyketide synthesis caused developmental arrest in A. subglobosum, which could not be rescued by DIF-1 addition. These results suggest that non-DIF-1 polyketide cascades involving downstream transcription factors are required for fruiting body development of A. subglobosum.",

Redox regulation has emerged as a crucial modulator of protein function, with particular relevance to aging. We previously identified a single methionine residue in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) myosin II (M394, near the myosin cardiomyopathy loop in the actin-binding interface) that is functionally sensitive to oxidation. We now show that oxidation of M394 is reversible by methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), restoring actin-activated ATPase activity. Sequence alignment reveals that M394 of Dicty myosin II is a cysteine residue in all human isoforms of skeletal and cardiac myosin. Using Dicty myosin II as a model for site-specific redox sensitivity of this Cys residue, the M394C mutant can be glutathionylated in vitro, resulting in reversible inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity, with effects similar to those of methionine oxidation at this site. This work illustrates the potential for myosin to function as a redox sensor in both non-muscle and muscle cells, modulating motility/contractility in response to oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "How a cell senses, responds, and moves toward, or away from an external cue is central to many biological and medical phenomena including morphogenesis, immune response, and cancer metastasis. Many eukaryotic cells have internal sensory mechanisms that allow them to sense these cues, often in the form of gradients of chemoattractant, voltage, or mechanical stress, and bias their motion in a specific direction. In this study, a new method for using microfluidics to study the electrotactic migration of cells is presented. Electrotaxis (also known as galvanotaxis) is the phenomenon by which cells bias their motion directionally in response to an externally applied electrical field. In this work, we present a new flow-based, salt bridge-free microfluidic device for imaging and quantifying cell motility and intracellular ion activity during electrotaxis. To eliminate salt bridges, we used a low nanoliter flow rate to slowly drive Faradaic waste products away from and out of the electrotaxis zone. This cell migration zone consisted of an array of fluidic confinement channels approximately 2\u2009<i>\u03bc</i>m in thickness. This confined height served to insulate the migrating cells from the electric field at the top and bottom of the cell, such that only the two-dimensional perimeter of the cells interacted with the electrical source. We demonstrate the ability to quantify the electrotactic velocity of migrating <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells and show how this confined design facilitates the imaging and quantification of the ion activity of electrotaxing cells. Finally, by spatially imaging the calcium concentration within these cells, we demonstrate that intracellular calcium preferentially translocates to the leading edge of migrating <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells during electrotaxis but does not exhibit this behavior during migration by chemotaxis in a gradient of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate or when cells freely migrate in the absence of an external cue.",

The chemoattractant cAMP is the chemoattractant regulating cell migration during this process and is released from the rear of cells. The process by which this cAMP release occurs has eluded investigators for many decades, but new findings suggest that this release can occur through expulsion during contractile vacuole (CV) ejection. The CV is an organelle that performs several functions inside the cell including the regulation of osmolarity, and discharges its content via exocytosis. The CV localizes to the rear of the cell and appears to be part of the polarity network, with the localization under the influence of the plasma membrane (PM) lipids, including the phosphoinositides (PIs), among those is PI(4,5)P2, the most abundant PI on the PM. Research on <i>D. discoideum</i> and neutrophils have shown that PI(4,5)P2 is enriched at the rear of migrating cells. In several systems, it has been shown that the essential regulator of exocytosis is through the exocyst complex, mediated in part by PI(4,5)P2-binding. This review features the role of the CV complex in <i>D. discoideum</i> signaling with a focus on the role of PI(4,5)P2 in regulating CV exocytosis and localization. Many of the regulators of these processes are conserved during evolution, so the mechanisms controlling exocytosis and membrane trafficking in <i>D. discoideum</i> and mammalian cells will be discussed, highlighting their important functions in membrane trafficking and signaling in health and disease.",

Our data indicate that a larger proportion of the phagosome proteome, compared with the whole cell proteome, has been acquired through gene duplication at a period coinciding with the emergence of innate and adaptive immunity. Our study also characterizes in detail the acquisition of novel proteins and the significant remodeling of the phagosome phosphoproteome that contributed to modify the core constituents of this organelle in evolution.

In this review, a selective survey of the multitude of functions of presenilins and the \u03b3-secretase complex is presented. Following a brief overview of \u03b3-secretase structure, assembly and maturation, three functional aspects are analyzed: (1) the role of \u03b3-secretase in autophagy and phagocytosis; (2) involvement of the complex in signaling related to endocytosis; and (3) control of calcium fluxes by presenilins.",

Neuronal migration requires cytoskeletal remodeling and actin regulation. Although Cotl1 strongly binds to F-actin, the role of Cotl1 in neuronal migration remains undescribed. In this study, we revealed that Cotl1 overexpression impaired migrationof both early- and late-born neurons during mouse corticogenesis. Moreover, Cotl1 overexpression delayed, rather than blocked, neuronal migration in late-born neurons. Cotl1 expression disturbed the morphology of migrating neurons, lengthening the leading processes. This study is the first to investigate the function of Cotl1, and the results indicate that Cotl1 is involved in the regulation of neuronal migration and morphogenesis.",

Cells that live in hypo-osmotic environments like freshwater must constantly battle water influx to avoid swelling until they burst. Many eukaryotic cells use contractile vacuoles to collect excess water from the cytosol and pump it out of the cell. Although contractile vacuoles are essential to many species, including important pathogens, the mechanisms that control their dynamics remain unclear. To identify basic principles governing contractile vacuole function, we here investigate the molecular mechanisms of two species with distinct vacuolar morphologies from different eukaryotic lineages\u00e2\u20ac\"the discoban <i>Naegleria gruberi</i> , and the amoebozoan slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> . Using quantitative cell biology we find that, although these species respond differently to osmotic challenges, they both use actin for osmoregulation, as well as vacuolar-type proton pumps for filling contractile vacuoles. We also use analytical modeling to show that cytoplasmic pressure is sufficient to drive water out of contractile vacuoles in these species, similar to findings from the alveolate <i>Paramecium multimicronucleatum</i> . Because these three lineages diverged well over a billion years ago, we propose that this represents an ancient eukaryotic mechanism of osmoregulation.",

Early studies on myosin heavy chain kinases in Dictyostelium discoideum revealed their unusual propensity to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in the context of an alpha-helix. Although recent studies show that some members of this family can also phosphorylate residues in non-helical regions, the name alpha-kinase has remained. During evolution, the alpha-kinase domains combined with many different functional subdomains such as von Willebrand factor-like motifs (vWKa) and even cation channels (TRPM6 and TRPM7). As a result, these kinases are implicated in a large variety of cellular processes such as protein translation, Mg(2+) homeostasis, intracellular transport, cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on different members of this kinase family and discuss the potential use of alpha-kinases as drug targets in diseases such as cancer.",

A review of the divergent functional properties of the CCC in metazoans and non-metazoans, and an updated phylogenetic coverage of the CCC using recent genomic data reveal: (1) The core CCC likely originated before the last common ancestor of unikonts and their closest bikont sister taxa. (2) Formation of the CCC may have constrained sequence evolution of the classical cadherin cytoplasmic domain and \u03b2-catenin in metazoa. (3) The \u03b1-catenin-binding domain in \u03b2-catenin appears to be the favored mutation site for disrupting \u03b2-catenin function in the CCC. (4) The ancestral function of the \u03b1/\u03b2-catenin heterodimer appears to be an actin-binding module. In some metazoan groups, more complex functions of \u03b1-catenin were gained by sequence divergence in the non-actin-binding (N-, M-) domains.

Our data show folding of this domain proceeds directly from an extended state and no thermodynamically distinct collapsed state of the polypeptide before folding is populated. Folding of ddFLN4 under load proceeds via an intermediate state. Three-state folding allows ddFLN4 to fold against significantly larger forces than would be possible for a mere two-state folder. We present a general model for protein folding kinetics under load that can predict refolding forces based on chain-length and zero force refolding rate.",

In light of possible differences in virulence characteristics, knowledge about genomic subgroups is therefore desirable. Two different genotyping methods, rep-PCR fingerprinting and partial gyrB gene sequencing were used to elucidate S. maltophilia intraspecies diversity. Rep-PCR fingerprinting revealed the presence of 12 large subgroups, while gyrB gene sequencing distinguished 10 subgroups. For 8 of them, the same strain composition was shown with both typing methods. A subset of 59 isolates representative for the gyrB groups was further investigated with regards to their pathogenic properties in a virulence model using Dictyostelium discoideum and Acanthamoeba castellanii as host organisms. A clear tendency towards accumulation of virulent strains could be observed for one group with A. castellanii and for two groups with D. discoideum. Several virulent strains did not cluster in any of the genetic groups, while other groups displayed no virulence properties at all. The amoeba pathogenicity model proved suitable in showing differences in S. maltophilia virulence. However, the model is still not sufficient to completely elucidate virulence as critical for a human host, since several strains involved in human infections did not show any virulence against amoeba.",

Despite its importance to biology and medicine, it is unclear how mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation is controlled. Here, we identify an unforeseen principle by which a GDP-bound form of the conserved small G protein Rho GTPase directly activates mTORC2 in AKT phosphorylation in social amoebae (Dictyostelium discoideum) cells. Using biochemical reconstitution with purified proteins, we demonstrate that Rho-GDP promotes AKT phosphorylation by assembling a supercomplex with Ras-GTP and mTORC2. This supercomplex formation is controlled by the chemoattractant-induced phosphorylation of Rho-GDP at S192 by GSK-3. Furthermore, Rho-GDP rescues defects in both mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation and directed cell migration in Rho-null cells in a manner dependent on phosphorylation of S192. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view that the GDP-bound forms of G proteins are inactive, our study reveals that mTORC2-AKT signalling is activated by Rho-GDP.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastomas are a highly aggressive cancer type which respond poorly to current pharmaceutical treatments, thus novel therapeutic approaches need to be investigated. One such approach involves the use of the bioactive natural product Tanshinone IIA (T2A) derived from the Chinese herb Danshen, where mechanistic insight for this anti-cancer agent is needed to validate its use. Here, we employ a tractable model system, Dictyostelium discoideum, to provide this insight. T2A potently inhibits cellular proliferation of Dictyostelium, suggesting molecular targets in this model. We show that T2A rapidly reduces phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB) activity, but surprisingly, the downstream complex mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is only inhibited following chronic treatment. Investigating regulators of mTORC1, including PKB, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), suggests these enzymes were not responsible for this effect, implicating an additional molecular mechanism of T2A. We identify this mechanism as the increased expression of sestrin, a negative regulator of mTORC1. We further show that combinatory treatment using a PI3K inhibitor and T2A gives rise to a synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. We then translate our findings to human and mouse-derived glioblastoma cell lines, where both a PI3K inhibitor (Paxalisib) and T2A reduces glioblastoma proliferation in monolayer cultures and in spheroid expansion, with combinatory treatment significantly enhancing this effect. Thus, we propose a new approach for cancer treatment, including glioblastomas, through combinatory treatment with PI3K inhibitors and T2A.",

To elucidate a more generally applicable structure, we used biochemical, bioinformatic, and molecular approaches to obtain RNase P RNA sequences from diverse organisms including representatives of six additional kingdoms of eucaryotes. Novel sequences were from acanthamoeba (Acathamoeba castellanii, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Filamoeba nolandi), animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster), alveolates (Theileria annulata, Babesia bovis), conosids (Dictyostelium discoideum, Physarum polycephalum), trichomonads (Trichomonas vaginalis), microsporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), and diplomonads (Giardia intestinalis). An improved alignment of eucaryal RNase P RNA sequences was assembled and used for statistical and comparative structural analysis. The analysis identifies a conserved core structure of eucaryal RNase P RNA that has been maintained throughout evolution and indicates that covariation in size occurs between some structural elements of the RNA. Eucaryal RNase P RNA contains regions of highly variable length and structure reminiscent of expansion segments found in rRNA. The eucaryal RNA has been remodeled through evolution as a simplified version of the structure found in bacterial and archaeal RNase P RNAs.",

This study establishes a fundamental limitation of such a mechanism, showing that there is a minimal fold-change detection error that cannot be overcome, no matter how large the separation of time scales is.

A role for Dnmt2 in the control of repetitive elements has been established in E. histolytica, Dictyostelium discoideum and Drosophila. Our recent work has shown that Ehmeth methylates tRNA(Asp), and this finding indicates that this enzyme has a dual DNA/tRNA(Asp) methyltransferase activity. This observation is in agreement with the dual activity that has been reported for D. discoideum and D. melanogaster. The functional significance of the DNA/tRNA specificity of Dnmt2 enzymes is still unknown. To address this question, a method to determine the tRNA methyltransferase activity of Dnmt2 proteins was established. In this video, we describe a straightforward approach to prepare an adequate tRNA substrate for Dnmt2 and a method to measure its tRNA methyltransferase activity.",

        "abstract": "Macroendocytosis comprising phagocytosis and macropinocytosis is an actin-driven process regulated by small GTPases that depend on the dynamic reorganization of the membrane that protrudes and internalizes extracellular material by cup-shaped structures. To effectively capture, enwrap, and internalize their targets, these cups are arranged into a peripheral ring or ruffle of protruding actin sheets emerging from an actin-rich, nonprotrusive zone at its base. Despite extensive knowledge of the mechanism driving actin assembly of the branched network at the protrusive cup edge, which is initiated by the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex downstream of Rac signaling, our understanding of actin assembly in the base is still incomplete. In the <i>Dictyostelium</i> model system, the Ras-regulated formin ForG was previously shown to specifically contribute to actin assembly at the cup base. Loss of ForG is associated with a strongly impaired macroendocytosis and a 50% reduction in F-actin content at the base of phagocytic cups, in turn indicating the presence of additional factors that specifically contribute to actin formation at the base. Here, we show that ForG synergizes with the Rac-regulated formin ForB to form the bulk of linear filaments at the cup base. Consistently, combined loss of both formins virtually abolishes cup formation and leads to severe defects of macroendocytosis, emphasizing the relevance of converging Ras- and Rac-regulated formin pathways in assembly of linear filaments in the cup base, which apparently provide mechanical support to the entire structure. Remarkably, we finally show that active ForB, unlike ForG, additionally drives phagosome rocketing to aid particle internalization.",

For example, the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has the ability to aggregate into a multicellular fruiting body upon starvation, while the pathogenic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite of humans. Globins are small heme proteins that are present in almost all extant organisms. Although several genomes of amoebozoan species have been sequenced, little is known about the phyletic distribution of globin genes within this phylum. Only two flavohemoglobins (FHbs) of D. discoideum have been reported and characterized previously while the genomes of Entamoeba species are apparently devoid of globin genes. We investigated eleven amoebozoan species for the presence of globin genes by genomic and phylogenetic in silico analyses. Additional FHb genes were identified in the genomes of four social amoebas and the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Moreover, a single-domain globin (SDFgb) of Hartmannella vermiformis, as well as two truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) of Acanthamoeba castellanii were identified. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these globin genes were independently acquired via horizontal gene transfer from some ancestral bacteria. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree of amoebozoan FHbs indicates that they do not share a common ancestry and that a transfer of FHbs from bacteria to amoeba occurred multiple times.",

The analysis of the genetic basis of manic depression, in particular, has been impeded by the absence of a suitable model system and by the lack of candidate causative genes. One recent approach to overcome these problems has involved identifying those genes which control the sensitivity to anti-manic drugs in a model organism. Characterisation of the role of these genes and their encoded proteins in this model has allowed the analysis of their mammalian homologues to elucidate the therapeutic role of these drugs and the possible aetiology of manic depression. This approach has been used successfully with the cellular slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum. This article introduces the use of model systems for pharmacogenetics research. It describes the identification of prolyl oligopeptidase in D. discoideum as a modulator of inositol phosphate signalling, and the subsequent identification of a common mechanism of action of three anti-manic drugs in mammalian neurons. The use of pharmacogenetics in model systems will provide a powerful tool for the ongoing analysis of both the treatment and cause of psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Avian pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> is the causative agent of extra-intestinal infections in birds known as colibacillosis, which can manifest as localized or systemic infections. The disease affects all stages of poultry production, resulting in economic losses that occur due to morbidity, carcass condemnation and increased mortality of the birds. APEC strains have a diverse virulence trait repertoire, which includes virulence factors involved in adherence to and invasion of the host cells, serum resistance factors, and toxins. However, the pathogenesis of APEC infections remains to be fully elucidated. The Type 6 secretion (T6SS) system has recently gained attention due to its role in the infection process and protection of bacteria from host defenses in human and animal pathogens. Previous work has shown that T6SS components are involved in the adherence to and invasion of host cells, as well as in the formation of biofilm, and intramacrophage bacterial replication. Here, we analyzed the frequency of T6SS genes <i>hcp</i>, <i>impK</i>, <i>evpB</i>, <i>vasK</i> and <i>icmF</i> in a collection of APEC strains and their potential role in virulence-associated phenotypes of APECO18. The T6SS genes were found to be significantly more prevalent in APEC than in fecal <i>E. coli</i> isolates from healthy birds. Expression of T6SS genes was analyzed in culture media and upon contact with host cells. Mutants were generated for <i>hcp</i>, <i>impK</i>, <i>evpB</i>, and <i>icmF</i> and characterized for their impact on virulence-associated phenotypes, including adherence to and invasion of host model cells, and resistance to predation by <i>Dictyostelium discoideum.</i> Deletion of the aforementioned genes did not significantly affect adherence and invasion capabilities of APECO18. Deletion of <i>hcp</i> reduced resistance of APECO18 to predation by <i>D. discoideum</i>, suggesting that T6SS is involved in the virulence of APECO18.",

RpkA-homologs are present in all so far sequenced Dictyostelidae as well as in several other lower eukaryotes like the oomycete Phytophthora, and in the Legionella host Acanthamoeba castellani. Here we show by immunofluorescence that RpkA localizes to endosomal membranes and is specifically recruited to phagosomes. RpkA interacts with the phagosomal protein complex V-ATPase as proteins of this complex co-precipitate with RpkA-GFP as well as with the GST-tagged PIPK domain of RpkA. Loss of RpkA leads to a defect in phagocytosis as measured by yeast particle uptake. The uptake of the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila was however unaltered whereas its intra-cellular replication was significantly enhanced in rpkA(-). The difference between wild type and rpkA(-) was even more prominent when L. hackeliae was used. When we investigated the reason for the enhanced susceptibility for L. pneumophila of rpkA(-) we could not detect a difference in endosomal pH but rpkA(-) showed depletion of phosphoinositides (PIP and PIP(2)) when we compared metabolically labeled phosphoinositides from wild type and rpkA(-). Furthermore rpkA(-) exhibited reduced nitrogen starvation tolerance, an indicator for a reduced autophagy rate. Our results indicate that RpkA is a component of the defense system of D. discoideum as well as other lower eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "Polarization is a crucial component in cell differentiation, development, and motility, but its details are not yet well understood. At the onset of cell locomotion, cells break symmetry to form well-defined cell fronts and rears. This polarity establishment varies across cell types: in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells, it is mediated by biochemical signaling pathways and can function in the absence of a cytoskeleton, while in keratocytes, it is tightly connected to cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanics. Theoretical models that have been developed to understand the onset of polarization have explored either signaling or mechanical pathways, yet few have explored mechanochemical mechanisms. However, many motile cells rely on both signaling modules and actin cytoskeleton to break symmetry and achieve a stable polarized state. We propose a general mechanochemical polarization model based on coupling between a stochastic model for the segregation of signaling molecules and a simplified mechanical model for actin cytoskeleton network competition. We find that local linear coupling between minimally nonlinear signaling and cytoskeletal systems, separately not supporting stable polarization, yields a robustly polarized cell state. The model captures the essence of spontaneous polarization of neutrophils, which has been proposed to emerge due to the competition between frontness and backness pathways.",

The three major Wnt pathways are activated by ligands, the Wnts, which clearly belong to the same gene family. However, their signal is then mediated by three separate sets of extracellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear components that are pathway-specific and that distinguish each of them. Homologs of the Wnt genes and of the Wnt pathways components have been discovered in many eukaryotic model systems and functional investigations have been carried out for most of them.

A dramatic decline in the rate of phagocytosis was observed in double mutants lacking calreticulin and calnexin, whereas only mild changes occurred in single mutants. Dictyostelium cells are professional phagocytes, capable of internalizing particles by a sequence of activities: adhesion of the particle to the cell surface, actin-dependent outgrowth of a phagocytic cup, and separation of the phagosome from the plasma membrane. In the double-null mutants, particles still adhered to the cell surface, but the outgrowth of phagocytic cups was compromised. Green fluorescent protein-tagged calreticulin and calnexin, expressed in wild-type cells, revealed a direct link of the endoplasmic reticulum to the phagocytic cup enclosing a particle, such that the Ca2+ storage capacity of calreticulin and calnexin might directly modulate activities of the actin system during particle uptake.",

        "abstract": "All but 11 of the 323 known actin sequences have Tyr at position 53, and the 11 exceptions have the conservative substitution Phe, which raises the following questions. What is the critical role(s) of Tyr-53, and, if it can be replaced by Phe, why has this happened so infrequently? We compared the properties of purified endogenous Dictyostelium actin and mutant constructs with Tyr-53 replaced by Phe, Ala, Glu, Trp, and Leu. The Y53F mutant did not differ significantly from endogenous actin in any of the properties assayed, but the Y53A and Y53E mutants differed substantially; affinity for DNase I was reduced, the rate of nucleotide exchange was increased, the critical concentration for polymerization was increased, filament elongation was inhibited, and polymerized actin was in the form of small oligomers and imperfect filaments. Growth and/or development of cells expressing these actin mutants were also inhibited. The Trp and Leu mutations had lesser but still significant effects on cell phenotype and the biochemical properties of the purified actins. We conclude that either Tyr or Phe is required to maintain the functional conformations of the DNase I-binding loop (D-loop) in both G- and F-actin, and that the conformation of the D-loop affects not only the properties that directly involve the D-loop (binding to DNase I and polymerization) but also allosterically modifies the conformation of the nucleotide-binding cleft, thus increasing the rate of nucleotide exchange. The apparent evolutionary \"preference\" for Tyr at position 53 may be the result of Tyr allowing dynamic modification of the D-loop conformation by phosphorylation (Baek, K., Liu, X., Ferron, F., Shu, S., Korn, E. D., and Dominguez, R. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 11748-11753) with effects similar, but not identical, to those of the Ala and Glu mutations.",

        "abstract": "Recently, it has become clear that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin triskelions and adaptor proteins assemble into lattices, forming clathrin-coated pits. These coated pits invaginate and detach from the membrane, a process that requires dynamic actin polymerization. We found an unexpected role for the clathrin adaptor epsin in regulating actin dynamics during this late stage of coated vesicle formation. In Dictyostelium cells, epsin is required for both the membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of the actin- and clathrin-binding protein Hip1r. Epsin-null and Hip1r-null cells exhibit deficiencies in the timing and organization of actin filaments at clathrin-coated pits. Consequently, clathrin structures persist on the membranes of epsin and Hip1r mutants and the internalization of clathrin structures is delayed. We conclude that epsin works with Hip1r to regulate actin dynamics by controlling the spatial and temporal coupling of actin filaments to clathrin-coated pits. Specific residues in the ENTH domain of epsin that are required for the membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of Hip1r are also required for normal actin and clathrin dynamics at the plasma membrane. We propose that epsin promotes the membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of Hip1r, which in turn regulates actin polymerization at clathrin-coated pits.",

Mechanical efficacy of a substrate correlates with its ability to maintain this coordination. Simulations modeling the active site of other myosin isoforms with different amino acids in the triad likewise imply that the amino acid composition at the nucleotide site could modulate function. The modeling has predictive power. In silico mutation experiments suggest mutations that would enhance GTP as a substrate for myosin while simultaneously making ATP a less effective substrate.",

Here, we report the underlying structural basis of Gip1 function. The crystal structure reveals that the region of Gip1 that binds to the G protein has a cylinder-like fold with a central hydrophobic cavity composed of six \u03b1-helices. Mutagenesis and biochemical analyses indicate that the hydrophobic cavity and the hydrogen bond network at the entrance of the cavity are essential for complex formation with the geranylgeranyl modification on the G\u03b3 subunit. Mutations of the cavity impair G protein sequestration and translocation to the membrane from the cytosol upon receptor stimulation, leading to defects in chemotaxis at higher chemoattractant concentrations. These results demonstrate that the Gip1-dependent regulation of G protein shuttling ensures wide-range gradient sensing in eukaryotic chemotaxis.",

        "abstract": "Chloroplasts have evolved from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont and been retained for more than 1 billion years by coordinated chloroplast division in multiplying eukaryotic cells. Chloroplast division is performed by ring structures at the division site, encompassing both the inside and the outside of the two envelopes. A part of the division machinery is derived from the cyanobacterial cytokinetic activity based on the FtsZ protein. In contrast, other parts of the division machinery involve proteins specific to eukaryotes, including a member of the dynamin family. Each member of the dynamin family is involved in the division or fusion of a distinct eukaryotic membrane system. To gain insight into the kind of ancestral dynamin protein and eukaryotic membrane activity that evolved to regulate chloroplast division, we investigated the functions of the dynamin proteins that are most closely related to chloroplast division proteins. These proteins in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and Arabidopsis thaliana localize at the sites of cell division, where they are involved in cytokinesis. Our results suggest that the dynamin for chloroplast division is derived from that involved in eukaryotic cytokinesis. Therefore, the chloroplast division machinery is a mixture of bacterial and eukaryotic cytokinesis components, with the latter a key factor in the synchronization of endosymbiotic cell division with host cell division, thus helping to establish the permanent endosymbiotic relationship.",

        "abstract": "Many types of cells are able to accurately sense shallow gradients of chemicals across their diameters, allowing the cells to move toward or away from chemical sources. This chemotactic ability relies on the remarkable capacity of cells to infer gradients from particles randomly arriving at cell-surface receptors by diffusion. Whereas the physical limits of concentration sensing by cells have been explored, there is no theory for the physical limits of gradient sensing. Here, we derive such a theory, using as models a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly monitoring sphere, which, respectively, infer gradients from the absorbed surface particle density or the positions of freely diffusing particles inside a spherical volume. We find that the perfectly absorbing sphere is superior to the perfectly monitoring sphere, both for concentration and gradient sensing, because previously observed particles are never remeasured. The superiority of the absorbing sphere helps explain the presence at the surfaces of cells of signal-degrading enzymes, such as PDE for cAMP in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) and BAR1 for mating factor alpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). Quantitatively, our theory compares favorably with recent measurements of Dicty moving up a cAMP gradient, suggesting these cells operate near the physical limits of gradient detection.",

While many features of cellular chemotaxis are shared among systems as diverse as bacteria and human immune cells, the machinery that guides the migration of these model organisms varies widely. In this article, we review current literature on the diversity of chemoattractant ligands, the cell surface receptors that detect and process chemotactic gradients, and the link between signal recognition and the regulation of cellular machinery that allow for efficient directed cellular movement. These facets of cellular chemotaxis are compared among E. coli, Dictyostelium discoideum, and mammalian neutrophils to derive organizational principles by which diverse cell systems sense and respond to chemotactic gradients to initiate cellular migration.",

        "abstract": "The acute diarrheal disease cholera is caused by the marine bacterium Vibrio cholerae. A type VI secretion system (T6SS), which is structurally similar to the bacteriophage cell-puncturing device, has been recently identified in V. cholerae and is used by this organism to confer virulence toward phagocytic eukaryotes, such as J774 murine macrophages and Dictyostelium discoideum. We tested the interbacterial virulence of V. cholerae strain V52, an O37 serogroup with a constitutively active T6SS. V52 was found to be highly virulent toward multiple Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium, and caused up to a 100,000-fold reduction in E. coli survival. Because the T6SS-deficient mutants V52\u0394vasK and V52\u0394vasH showed toxicity defects that could be complemented, virulence displayed by V. cholerae depends on a functional T6SS. V. cholerae V52 and strains of the O1 serogroup were resistant to V52, suggesting that V. cholerae has acquired immunity independently of its serogroup. We hypothesize that the T6SS, in addition to targeting eukaryotic host cells, confers toxicity toward other bacteria, providing a means of interspecies competition to enhance environmental survival. Thus, the V. cholerae T6SS may enhance the survival of V. cholerae in its aquatic ecosystem during the transmission of cholera and between epidemics.",

        "abstract": "Dynein is a motor protein that moves on microtubules (MTs) using the energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. To understand its motility mechanism, it is crucial to know how the signal of MT binding is transmitted to the ATPase domain to enhance ATP hydrolysis. However, the molecular basis of signal transmission at the dynein-MT interface remains unclear. Scanning mutagenesis of tubulin identified two residues in \u03b1-tubulin, R403 and E416, that are critical for ATPase activation and directional movement of dynein. Electron cryomicroscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that these residues form salt bridges with the residues in the dynein MT-binding domain (MTBD) that work in concert to induce registry change in the stalk coiled coil and activate the ATPase. The R403-E3390 salt bridge functions as a switch for this mechanism because of its reversed charge relative to other residues at the interface. This study unveils the structural basis for coupling between MT binding and ATPase activation and implicates the MTBD in the control of directional movement.",

        "abstract": "How the opposing activity of kinesin and dynein motors generates polarized distribution of organelles inside cells is poorly understood and hotly debated [1, 2]. Possible explanations include stochastic mechanical competition [3, 4], coordinated regulation by motor-associated proteins [5-7], mechanical activation of motors [8], and lipid-induced organization [9]. Here, we address this question by using phagocytosed latex beads to generate early phagosomes (EPs) that move bidirectionally along microtubules (MTs) in an in\u00a0vitro assay [9]. Dynein/kinesin activity on individual EPs is recorded as real-time force generation of the motors against an optical trap. Activity of one class of motors frequently coincides with, or is rapidly followed by opposite motors. This leads to frequent and rapid reversals of EPs in the trap. Remarkably, the choice between dynein and kinesin can be explained by the tossing of a coin. Opposing motors therefore appear to function stochastically and independently of each other, as also confirmed by observing no effect on kinesin function when dynein is inhibited on the EPs. A simple binomial probability calculation based on the geometry of EP-microtubule contact explains the observed activity of dynein and kinesin on phagosomes. This understanding of intracellular transport in terms of a hypothetical coin, if it holds true for other cargoes, provides a conceptual framework to explain the polarized localization of organelles inside cells.",

Mutant shk1 null cells lack polarity, move very slowly, and exhibit an elevated and temporally extended chemoattractant-mediated activation of the kinase Akt/PKB. GFP fusions of the PH domain of Akt/PKB or the PH-domain-containing protein CRAC, which become transiently associated with the plasma membrane after a global stimulation with a chemoattractant, remain associated with the plasma membrane for an extended period of time in shk1 null cells. These results suggest that SHK1 is a negative regulator of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) pathway. Furthermore, when a chemoattractant gradient is applied to a wild-type cell, these PH-domain-containing proteins and the F-actin-binding protein coronin localize to its leading edge, but in an shk1 null cell they become randomly associated with the plasma membrane and cortex, irrespective of the direction of the chemoattractant gradient, suggesting that SHK1 is required for the proper spatiotemporal control of F-actin levels in chemotaxing cells. Consistent with such functions, SHK1 is localized at the plasma membrane/cortex, and we show that its SH2 domain is required for this localization and the proper function of SHK1.",

Using (i) optimal level of extracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]ext = 3 mM) we found, (ii) controllable fluid shear stress of low magnitude (\u03c3 < 0.5 Pa), and (iii) the ability to swiftly reverse flow direction (within one second), we are able to successfully signal Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae and trigger migratory responses with heretofore unreported control and precision. Specifically, we are able to systematically determine the mechanical input signal required to achieve any predetermined sequences of steps including straightforward motion, reversal and trapping. The mechanotactic cellular trapping is achieved for the first time and is associated with a stalling frequency of 0.06 ~ 0.1 Hz for a reversing direction mechanostimulus, above which the cells are effectively trapped while maintaining a high level of directional sensing. The value of this frequency is very close to the stalling frequency recently reported for chemotactic cell trapping [Meier B, et al. (2011) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108:11417-11422], suggesting that the limiting factor may be the slowness of the internal chemically-based motility apparatus.",

        "abstract": "The past decade has seen a remarkable explosion in our knowledge of the size and diversity of the myosin superfamily. Since these actin-based motors are candidates to provide the molecular basis for many cellular movements, it is essential that motility researchers be aware of the complete set of myosins in a given organism. The availability of cDNA and/or draft genomic sequences from humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Dictyostelium discoideum has allowed us to tentatively define and compare the sets of myosin genes in these organisms. This analysis has also led to the identification of several putative myosin genes that may be of general interest. In humans, for example, we find a total of 40 known or predicted myosin genes including two new myosins-I, three new class II (conventional) myosins, a second member of the class III/ninaC myosins, a gene similar to the class XV deafness myosin, and a novel myosin sharing at most 33% identity with other members of the superfamily. These myosins are in addition to the recently discovered class XVI myosin with N-terminal ankyrin repeats and two human genes with similarity to the class XVIII PDZ-myosin from mouse. We briefly describe these newly recognized myosins and extend our previous phylogenetic analysis of the myosin superfamily to include a comparison of the complete or nearly complete inventories of myosin genes from several experimentally important organisms.",

        "abstract": "Colloidal particles with specific binding affinity are essential for in vivo and in vitro biosensing, targeted drug delivery, and micrometer-scale self-assembly. Key to these techniques are surface functionalizations that provide high affinities to specific target molecules. For stabilization in physiological environments, current particle coating methods rely on adsorbed surfactants. However, spontaneous desorption of these surfactants typically has an undesirable influence on lipid membranes. To address this issue and create particles for targeting molecules in lipid membranes, we present here a surfactant-free coating method that combines high binding affinity with stability at physiological conditions. After activating charge-stabilized polystyrene microparticles with EDC/Sulfo-NHS, we first coat the particles with a specific protein and subsequently covalently attach a dense layer of poly(ethyelene) glycol. This polymer layer provides colloidal stability at physiological conditions as well as antiadhesive properties, while the protein coating provides the specific affinity to the targeted molecule. We show that NeutrAvidin-functionalized particles bind specifically to biotinylated membranes and that Concanavalin A-functionalized particles bind specifically to the glycocortex of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The affinity of the particles changes with protein density, which can be tuned during the coating procedure. The generic and surfactant-free coating method reported here transfers the high affinity and specificity of a protein onto colloidal polystyrene microparticles.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a method for studying cellular adhesion by using a custom-designed microfluidic device with parallel non-connected tapered channels. The design enables investigation of cellular responses to a large range of shear stress (ratio of 25) with a single input flow-rate. For each shear stress, a large number of cells are analyzed (500-1500 cells), providing statistically relevant data within a single experiment. Besides adhesion strength measurements, the microsystem presented in this paper enables in-depth analysis of cell detachment kinetics by real-time videomicroscopy. It offers the possibility to analyze adhesion-associated processes, such as migration or cell shape change, within the same experiment. To show the versatility of our device, we examined quantitatively cell adhesion by analyzing kinetics, adhesive strength and migration behaviour or cell shape modifications of the unicellular model cell organism Dictyostelium discoideum at 21\u2009\u00b0C and of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. For both cell types, we found that the threshold stresses, which are necessary to detach the cells, follow lognormal distributions, and that the detachment process follows first order kinetics. In addition, for particular conditions' cells are found to exhibit similar adhesion threshold stresses, but very different detachment kinetics, revealing the importance of dynamics analysis to fully describe cell adhesion. With its rapid implementation and potential for parallel sample processing, such microsystem offers a highly controllable platform for exploring cell adhesion characteristics in a large set of environmental conditions and cell types, and could have wide applications across cell biology, tissue engineering, and cell screening.",

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that the pocket is in equilibrium between open and closed conformations. In the absence of actin, the closed conformation is favored. When myosin binds actin, the open conformation becomes more favored, facilitating nucleotide release. We found that faster myosins favor a more closed pocket in the actomyosin\u2022ADP state, with smaller values of \u0394H(0) and \u0394S(0), even though these myosins release ADP at a faster rate. A model involving a partitioning of free energy between work-generating steps prior to rate-limiting ADP release explains both the unexpected correlation between velocity and opening of the pocket and the observation that fast myosins are less efficient than slow myosins.",

LCV formation is a complex process that involves a plethora of type IV-secreted effector proteins. The effector RidL binds the Vps29 retromer subunit, blocks retrograde vesicle trafficking, and promotes intracellular bacterial replication. Here, we reveal that the 29-kDa N-terminal domain of RidL (RidL<sub>2-281</sub>) adopts a \"foot-like\" fold comprising a protruding \u03b2-hairpin at its \"heel\". The deletion of the \u03b2-hairpin, the exchange to Glu of Ile<sub>170</sub> in the \u03b2-hairpin, or Leu<sub>152</sub> in Vps29 abolishes the interaction in eukaryotic cells and in vitro. RidL<sub>2-281</sub> or RidL displace the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D5 from the retromer and LCVs, respectively, and TBC1D5 promotes the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Thus, the hydrophobic \u03b2-hairpin of RidL is critical for binding of the L. pneumophila effector to the Vps29 retromer subunit and displacement of the regulator TBC1D5.",

        "abstract": "Transient kinetic measurements of the actomyosin ATPase provided the basis of the Lymn-Taylor model for the cross-bridge cycle, which underpins current models of contraction. Following the determination of the structure of the myosin motor domain, it has been possible to introduce probes at defined sites and resolve the steps in more detail. Probes have been introduced in the Dicytostelium myosin II motor domain via three routes: (i) single tryptophan residues at strategic locations throughout the motor domain; (ii) green fluorescent protein fusions at the N and C termini; and (iii) labelled cysteine residues engineered across the actin-binding cleft. These studies are interpreted with reference to motor domain crystal structures and suggest that the tryptophan (W501) in the relay loop senses the lever arm position, which is controlled by the switch 2 open-to-closed transition at the active site. Actin has little effect on this process per se. A mechanism of product release is proposed in which actin has an indirect effect on the switch 2 and lever arm position to achieve mechanochemical coupling. Switch 1 closing appears to be a key step in the nucleotide-induced actin dissociation, while its opening is required for the subsequent activation of product release. This process has been probed with F239W and F242W substitutions in the switch 1 loop. The E706K mutation in skeletal myosin IIa is associated with a human myopathy. To simulate this disease we investigated the homologous mutation, E683K, in the Dictyostelium myosin motor domain.",

To understand the effect of this mutation on the function of actin filaments and gain insight into the mechanism of disease onset, we prepared and biochemically characterised K336I mutant actin from Dictyostelium discoideum. Subtilisin cleavage assays revealed that the structure of the DNase-I binding loop (D-loop) of monomeric K336I actin, which would face the adjacent actin-protomer in filaments, differed from that of wild type (WT) actin. Although K336I actin underwent normal salt-dependent reversible polymerisation and formed apparently normal filaments, interactions of K336I filaments with alpha-actinin, myosin II, and cofilin were disrupted. Furthermore, co-filaments of K336I and WT actins also exhibited abnormal interactions with cofilin, implying that K336I actin altered the structure of the neighbouring WT actin protomers such that interaction between cofilin and the WT actin protomers was prevented. We speculate that disruption of the interactions between co-filaments and actin-binding proteins is the primary reason why the K336I mutation induces muscle disease in a dominant fashion.",

We have used functional complementation of an Escherichia coli tag alkA mutant to screen for 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase genes in genomic libraries of the soil bacterium Bacillus cereus. Three genes were recovered: alkC, alkD and alkE. The amino acid sequence of AlkE is homologous to the E. coli AlkA sequence. AlkC and AlkD represent novel proteins without sequence similarity to any protein of known function. However, iterative and indirect sequence similarity searches revealed that AlkC and AlkD are distant homologues of each other within a new protein superfamily that is ubiquitous in the prokaryotic kingdom. Homologues of AlkC and AlkD were also identified in the amoebas Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum, but no other eukaryotic counterparts of the superfamily were found. The alkC and alkD genes were expressed in E. coli and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. Both proteins were found to be specific for removal of N-alkylated bases, and showed no activity on oxidized or deaminated base lesions in DNA. B. cereus AlkC and AlkD thus define novel families of alkylbase DNA glycosylases within a new protein superfamily.",

Functional analysis of the LTR showed that the 13-bp motif is a cis-regulatory element involved in activation by tissue culture, wounding, and treatment with elicitors. The 13-bp motif contains a conserved motif (L box) that has been implicated in the expression of phenylpropanoid synthetic genes in response to defense-related stresses. To gain further insight into the regulatory mechanism of the retrotransposon and defense-related genes, cDNAs encoding four different proteins binding to the 13-bp motif have been isolated and characterized. One protein is identical to the previously reported NtMYB1, the RNA for which is induced by virus infection; the others are also MYB-related factors. One of these factors, NtMYB2, was analyzed in detail. NtMYB2 mRNA was induced by wounding and by treatment with elicitors. NtMYB2 activated expression from the promoter with the 13-bp motif and from the promoter of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene (Pv-PAL2) in tobacco protoplasts. Overexpression of NtMYB2 cDNA in transgenic tobacco plants induced expression of Tto1 and a PAL gene. Together, these results indicate that NtMYB2 is involved in the stress response of the retrotransposon and defense-related genes.",

We also used a flow cytometer to quantify the 450/530 nm ratio of fluorescence emissions by whole cells. <i>Results:</i> We find that using all the information provided by spectral analysis to perform spectral decomposition dramatically improves the imaging resolution compared to using just two channels, as commonly used to calculate generalized polarisation (GP). Coupled to a new plugin called Fraction Mapper, developed to represent the fraction of light intensity in the first component in a stack of two images, we obtain very clear pictures of both the intra-cellular distribution of the probes, and the polarity of the cellular environments where the lipid probes are localised. Our results lead us to conclude that, in live cells kept at 37\u00b0C, laurdan, and M-laurdan to a lesser extent, have a strong tendency to accumulate in the very apolar environment of intra-cytoplasmic lipid droplets, but label the plasma membrane (PM) of mammalian cells ineffectively. On the other hand, C-laurdan labels the PM very quickly and effectively, and does not detectably accumulate in lipid droplets. <i>Conclusions:</i> From using these probes on a variety of mammalian cell lines, as well as on cells from <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, we conclude that, apart from the lipid droplets, which are very apolar, probes in intracellular membranes reveal a relatively polar and hydrated environment, suggesting a very marked dominance of liquid disordered states. PMs, on the other hand, are much more apolar, suggesting a strong dominance of liquid ordered state, which fits with their high sterol contents.",

        "title": "Discoidin Domain Receptors: Potential Actors and Targets in Cancer.",
        "abstract": "The extracellular matrix critically controls cancer cell behavior by inducing several signaling pathways through cell membrane receptors. Besides conferring structural properties to tissues around the tumor, the extracellular matrix is able to regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. Among these receptors, the integrins family constitutes a major class of receptors that mediate cell interactions with extracellular matrix components. Twenty years ago, a new class of extracellular matrix receptors has been discovered. These tyrosine kinase receptors are the two discoidin domain receptors DDR1 and DDR2. DDR1 was first identified in the Dictyostelium discoideum and was shown to mediate cell aggregation. DDR2 shares highly conserved sequences with DDR1. Both receptors are activated upon binding to collagen, one of the most abundant proteins in extracellular matrix. While DDR2 can only be activated by fibrillar collagen, particularly types I and III, DDR1 is mostly activated by type I and IV collagens. In contrast with classical growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors which display a rapid and transient activation, DDR1 and DDR2 are unique in that they exhibit delayed and sustained receptor phosphorylation upon binding to collagen. Recent studies have reported differential expression and mutations of DDR1 and DDR2 in several cancer types and indicate clearly that these receptors have to be taken into account as new players in the different aspects of tumor progression, from non-malignant to highly malignant and invasive stages. This review will discuss the current knowledge on the role of DDR1 and DDR2 in malignant transformation, cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, migratory, and invasive processes, and finally the modulation of the response to chemotherapy. These new insights suggest that DDR1 and DDR2 are new potential targets in cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Talin, which is composed of head (THD) and rod domains, plays an important role in cell adhesion events in diverse species including most metazoans and Dictyostelium discoideum. Talin is abundant in the cytosol; however, it mediates adhesion by associating with integrins in the plasma membrane where it forms a primary link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Cells modulate the partitioning of talin between the plasma membrane and the cytosol to control cell adhesion. Here, we combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with subcellular fractionation to characterize two distinct THD-rod domain interactions that control the interaction of talin with the actin cytoskeleton or its localization to the plasma membrane. An interaction between a discrete vinculin-binding region of the rod (VBS1/2a; Tln1(482-787)), and the THD restrains talin from interacting with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that vinculin binding to VBS1/2a results in talin recruitment to the plasma membrane. Thus, we have structurally defined specific inter-domain interactions between THD and the talin rod domain that regulate the subcellular localization of talin.",

        "abstract": "Thermotaxis is the phenomenon where an organism directs its movement toward its preferred temperature. So far, the molecular origin for this precision-sensing behavior remains a puzzle. We propose a model of Escherichia coli thermotaxis and show that the precision-sensing behavior in E. coli thermotaxis can be carried out by the gradient-sensing chemotaxis pathway under two general conditions. First, the thermosensor response to temperature is inverted by its internal adaptation state. For E. coli, chemoreceptor Tar changes from a warm sensor to a cold sensor on increase of its methylation level. Second, temperature directly affects the adaptation kinetics. The adapted activity in E. coli increases with temperature in contrast to the perfect adaptation to chemical stimuli. Given these two conditions, E. coli thermotaxis is achieved by the cryophilic and thermophilic responses for temperature above and below a critical temperature Tc, which is encoded by internal pathway parameters. Our model results are supported by both experiments with adaptation-disabled mutants and the recent temperature impulse response measurements for wild-type cells. Tc is predicted to decrease with the background attractant concentration. This mechanism for precision sensing in an adaptive gradient-sensing system may apply to other organisms, such as Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans.",

        "abstract": "Actin binding proteins play key roles in cell structure and movement particularly as regulators of the assembly, stability and localization of actin filaments in the cytoplasm. In the present study, a cDNA clone encoding an actin bundling protein named as AhABP was isolated from Acanthamoeba healyi, a causative agent of granulomatous amebic encephalitis. This clone exhibited high similarity with genes of Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum, which encode actin bundling proteins. Domain search analysis revealed the presence of essential conserved regions, i.e., an active actin binding site and 2 putative calcium binding EF-hands. Transfected amoeba cells demonstrated that AhABP is primarily localized in phagocytic cups, peripheral edges, pseudopods, and in cortical cytoplasm where actins are most abundant. Moreover, AhABP after the deletion of essential regions formed ellipsoidal inclusions within transfected cells. High-speed co-sedimentation assays revealed that AhABP directly interacted with actin in the presence of up to 10 microM of calcium. Under the electron microscope, thick parallel bundles were formed by full length AhABP, in contrast to the thin actin bundles formed by constructs with deletion sites. In the light of these results, we conclude that AhABP is a novel actin bundling protein that is importantly associated with actin filaments in the cytoplasm.",

Based on the results of x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy of microfibrils, and cellobiohydrolase I-gold labeling, we report the occurrence of cellulose biosynthesis in nine species representing three of the five sections of cyanobacteria. Sequence analysis of the genomes of four cyanobacteria revealed the presence of multiple amino acid sequences bearing the DDD35QXXRW motif conserved in all cellulose synthases. Pairwise alignments demonstrated that CesAs from plants were more similar to putative cellulose synthases from Anabaena sp. Pasteur Culture Collection 7120 and Nostoc punctiforme American Type Culture Collection 29133 than any other cellulose synthases in the database. Multiple alignments of putative cellulose synthases from Anabaena sp. Pasteur Culture Collection 7120 and N. punctiforme American Type Culture Collection 29133 with the cellulose synthases of other prokaryotes, Arabidopsis, Gossypium hirsutum, Populus alba x Populus tremula, corn (Zea mays), and Dictyostelium discoideum showed that cyanobacteria share an insertion between conserved regions U1 and U2 found previously only in eukaryotic sequences. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the cyanobacterial cellulose synthases share a common branch with CesAs of vascular plants in a manner similar to the relationship observed with cyanobacterial and chloroplast 16s rRNAs, implying endosymbiotic transfer of CesA from cyanobacteria to plants and an ancient origin for cellulose synthase in eukaryotes.",

        "abstract": "Tubercular <i>Mycobacteria</i> and <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> are the causative agents of potentially fatal respiratory diseases due to their intrinsic pathogenesis but also due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance that limits treatment options. The aim of our study was to explore the antimicrobial activity of a small ligand-based chemical library of 1255 structurally diverse compounds. These compounds were screened in a combination of three assays, two monitoring the intracellular growth of the pathogenic bacteria, <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> and <i>L. pneumophila</i>, and one assessing virulence of <i>M. marinum</i>. We set up these assays using two amoeba strains, the genetically tractable social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and the free-living amoeba <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i>. In summary, 64 (5.1%) compounds showed anti-infective/anti-virulence activity in at least one of the three assays. The intracellular assays hit rate varied between 1.7% (<i>n</i> = 22) for <i>M. marinum</i> and 2.8% (<i>n</i> = 35) for <i>L. pneumophila</i> with seven compounds in common for both pathogens. In parallel, 1.2% (<i>n</i> = 15) of the tested compounds were able to restore <i>D. discoideum</i> growth in the presence of <i>M. marinum</i> spiked in a lawn of food bacteria. We also validated the generality of the hits identified in the <i>A. castellanii</i>-<i>M. marinum</i> anti-infective screen using the <i>D. discoideum</i>-<i>M. marinum</i> host-pathogen model. The characterization of anti-infective and antibacterial hits in the latter infection model revealed compounds able to reduce intracellular growth more than 50% at 30 \u03bcM. Moreover, the chemical space and physico-chemical properties of the anti-<i>M. marinum</i> hits were compared to standard and candidate <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) drugs using ChemGPS-NP. A principle component analysis identified separate clusters for anti-<i>M. marinum</i> and anti-<i>L. pneumophila</i> hits unveiling the potentially new physico-chemical properties of these hits compared to standard and candidate <i>M. tuberculosis</i> drugs. Our studies underscore the relevance of using a combination of low-cost and low-complexity assays with full 3R compliance in concert with a rationalized focused library of compounds to identify new chemical scaffolds and to dissect some of their properties prior to taking further steps toward compound development.",

S. maltophilia has been recently described as an Amoebae-Resistant Bacteria (ARB) that exists as part of the microbiome of various free-living amoebae (FLA) from waters. Co-culture approaches with Vermamoeba vermiformis demonstrated the ability of this bacterium to resist amoebal digestion. In the present study, we assessed the survival and growth of six environmental and one clinical S. maltophilia strains within two amoebal species: Acanthamoeba castellanii and Willaertia magna. We also evaluated bacterial virulence properties using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. A co-culture approach was carried out over 96 hours and the abundance of S. maltophilia cells was measured using quantitative PCR and culture approach. The presence of bacteria inside the amoeba was confirmed using confocal microscopy. Our results showed that some S. maltophilia strains were able to multiply within both amoebae and exhibited multiplication rates up to 17.5 and 1166 for A. castellanii and W. magna, respectively. In contrast, some strains were unable to multiply in either amoeba. Out of the six environmental S. maltophilia strains tested, one was found to be virulent. Surprisingly, this strain previously isolated from a soil amoeba, Micriamoeba, was unable to infect both amoebal species tested. We further performed an assay with a mutant strain of S. maltophilia BurA1 lacking the efflux pump ebyCAB gene and found the mutant to be more virulent and more efficient for intra-amoebal multiplication. Overall, the results obtained strongly indicated that free-living amoebae could be an important ecological niche for S. maltophilia.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells use cytoskeletal proteins to regulate and modify cell shape. During cytokinesis or eukaryotic cell crawling, contractile forces are generated inside the cell to constrict the division site or to haul the rear of the cell forward, respectively. In many cases, these forces have been attributed to the activity of molecular motors, such as myosin II, which, by pulling on actin filaments, can produce contraction of the actin cytoskeleton. However, prokaryotic division is driven by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ and does not seem to require additional molecular motors to constrict the division site. Likewise, Dictyostelium discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae can perform cytokinesis under motor-free conditions. In addition, many crawling cells can translocate when myosin is inhibited or absent. In this review, we point out another force-generation mechanism that can play a significant role in driving these processes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This mechanism is mediated by cross-linking and bundling proteins that form effective interactions between cytoskeletal filaments. Some recent studies in this area are reviewed and the physical underpinnings of this force-generation mechanism are explained.",

        "abstract": "The parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica relies on a very dynamic cytoskeleton in order to invade and survive in host tissues. Identification of cytoskeletal elements is key to understanding these processes. Here we present the characterization of EhLimA, the first LIM protein of E. histolytica. EhLimA consists of a single LIM domain at its N terminus and exhibits the highest degree of homology with DdLimE from Dictyostelium discoideum. Immunofluorescence localization of EhLimA using anti-EhLimA antibodies revealed that EhLimA is highly concentrated at the plasma membrane of cells. Silencing or overexpression of the EhLimA gene did not have a significant effect on the growth or morphology of the parasite. EhLimA associates with the cytoskeleton as demonstrated by the enrichment of the protein in cytoskeleton fractions as well as in pull-down assays that revealed that cytoskeleton association involves interaction with actin. EhLimA binding to actin was shown to be dependent on the N-terminal LIM domain of EhLimA, as removal of even half of the LIM domain resulted in almost complete inhibition of the binding to actin. We also found that a portion of EhLimA floats to the lower-density regions of a sucrose gradient together with portions of the Gal-lectin light subunit and actin. Treatment of cells with the cholesterol-sequestering agent digitonin resulted in increased solubility of EhLimA. These results indicate that in addition to cytoskeletal association, EhLimA may also associate with lipid rafts in the parasite plasma membrane and suggest that EhLimA may be part of the molecular system connecting the actin cytoskeleton to membrane rafts.",

The defect caused by the absence of the sdhA family was less severe during growth within Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, indicating that the requirement for SdhA shows cell-type specificity. Macrophages harboring the L. pneumophila sdhA mutant showed increased nuclear degradation, mitochondrial disruption, membrane permeability, and caspase activation, indicating a role for SdhA in preventing host cell death.

        "abstract": "The evolution of actin gene families is characterized by independent expansions and contractions across the eukaryotic tree of life. Here, we assess diversity of actin gene sequences within three lineages of the genus Arcella, a free-living testate (shelled) amoeba in the Arcellinida. We established four clonal lines of two morphospecies, Arcella hemisphaerica and A. vulgaris, and assessed their phylogenetic relationship within the \"Amoebozoa\" using small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU-rDNA) genealogy. We determined that the two lines of A. hemisphaerica are identical in SSU-rDNA, while the two A. vulgaris are independent genetic lineages. Furthermore, we characterized multiple actin gene copies from all lineages. Analyses of the resulting sequences reveal numerous diverse actin genes, which differ mostly by synonymous substitutions. We estimate that the actin gene family contains 40-50 paralogous members in each lineage. None of the three independent lineages share the same paralog with another, and divergence between actins reaches 29% in contrast to just 2% in SSU-rDNA. Analyses of effective number of codons (ENC), compositional bias, recombination signatures, and genetic diversity in the context of a gene tree indicate that there are two groups of actins evolving with distinct patterns of molecular evolution. Within these groups, there have been multiple independent expansions of actin genes within each lineage. Together, these data suggest that the two groups are located in different regions of the Arcella genome. Furthermore, we compare the Arcella actin gene family with the relatively well-described gene family in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and other members of the Amoebozoa clade. Overall patterns of molecular evolution are similar in Arcella and Dictyostelium. However, the separation of genes in two distinct groups coupled with recent expansion is characteristic of Arcella and might reflect an unusual pattern of gene family evolution in the lobose testate amoebae. We provide a model to account for both the existence of two distinct groups and the pattern of recent independent expansion leading to a large number of actins in each lineage.",

Dcsa- mutants formed fruiting bodies with normal stalks, but their spore and cyst walls lacked cellulose, which obliterated stress-resistance of spores and rendered cysts entirely non-viable. A dcsa-/dcsb- mutant made no walled spores, stalk cells or cysts, although simple fruiting structures were formed with a droplet of amoeboid cells resting on an sheathed column of decaying cells. DcsB is expressed in prestalk and stalk cells, while DcsA is additionally expressed in spores and cysts. We conclude that cellulose is essential for encystation and that cellulose synthase may be a suitable target for drugs to prevent encystation and render amoeba pathogens susceptible to conventional antibiotics.",

Research into the function of these domains exploded with their identification in a number of proteins linked to human disease, including leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in Parkinson's disease and cancer, respectively. This surge in research has resulted in a growing body of data revealing the role that ROC domains play in regulating protein function and signaling pathways.

        "abstract": "Robustness is an essential feature of biological systems, and any mathematical model that describes such a system should reflect this feature. Especially, persistence of oscillatory behavior is an important issue. A benchmark model for this phenomenon is the Laub-Loomis model, a nonlinear model for cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium discoideum. This model captures the most important features of biomolecular networks oscillating at constant frequencies. Nevertheless, the robustness of its oscillatory behavior is not yet fully understood. Given a system that exhibits oscillating behavior for some set of parameters, the central question of robustness is how far the parameters may be changed, such that the qualitative behavior does not change. The determination of such a \"robustness region\" in parameter space is an intricate task. If the number of parameters is high, it may be also time consuming. In the literature, several methods are proposed that partially tackle this problem. For example, some methods only detect particular bifurcations, or only find a relatively small box-shaped estimate for an irregularly shaped robustness region. Here, we present an approach that is much more general, and is especially designed to be efficient for systems with a large number of parameters. As an illustration, we apply the method first to a well understood low-dimensional system, the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. This is a predator-prey model featuring satiation of the predator. It has only two parameters and its bifurcation diagram is available in the literature. We find a good agreement with the existing knowledge about this model. When we apply the new method to the high dimensional Laub-Loomis model, we obtain a much larger robustness region than reported earlier in the literature. This clearly demonstrates the power of our method. From the results, we conclude that the biological system underlying is much more robust than was realized until now.",

In yeast, the 25 MED subunits are distributed within three core subcomplexes and a separable kinase module composed of Med12, Med13 and the Cdk8-CycC pair thought to control the reversible interaction between MED and PolII by phosphorylating repeated heptapeptides within the Rpb1 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). Here, MED conservation has been investigated across the eukaryotic kingdom. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Med2, Med3/Pgd1 and Med5/Nut1 subunits are apparent homologs of metazoan Med29/Intersex, Med27/Crsp34 and Med24/Trap100, respectively, and these and other 30 identified human MED subunits have detectable counterparts in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, indicating that none is specific to metazoans. Indeed, animal/fungal subunits are also conserved in plants, green and red algae, entamoebids, oomycetes, diatoms, apicomplexans, ciliates and the 'deep-branching' protists Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia lamblia. Surprisingly, although lacking CTD heptads, T. vaginalis displays 44 MED subunit homologs, including several CycC, Med12 and Med13 paralogs. Such observations have allowed the identification of a conserved 17-subunit framework around which peripheral subunits may be assembled, and support a very ancient eukaryotic origin for a large, four-module MED. The implications of this comprehensive work for MED structure-function relationships are discussed.",

        "abstract": "There are a variety of bacterial defense strategies to survive in a hostile environment. Generation of extracellular polysaccharides has proved to be a simple but effective strategy against the host's innate immune system. A comparative genomics approach led us to identify a new protein family termed Stealth, most likely involved in the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. This protein family is characterized by a series of domains conserved across phylogeny from bacteria to eukaryotes. In bacteria, Stealth (previously characterized as SacB, XcbA, or WefC) is encoded by subsets of strains mainly colonizing multicellular organisms, with evidence for a protective effect against the host innate immune defense. More specifically, integrating all the available information about Stealth proteins in bacteria, we propose that Stealth is a D-hexose-1-phosphoryl transferase involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides. In the animal kingdom, Stealth is strongly conserved across evolution from social amoebas to simple and complex multicellular organisms, such as Dictyostelium discoideum, hydra, and human. Based on the occurrence of Stealth in most Eukaryotes and a subset of Prokaryotes together with its potential role in extracellular polysaccharide synthesis, we propose that metazoan Stealth functions to regulate the innate immune system. Moreover, there is good reason to speculate that the acquisition and spread of Stealth could be responsible for future epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by a large variety of eubacterial pathogens. Our in silico identification of a homologous protein in the human host will help to elucidate the causes of Stealth-dependent virulence. At a more basic level, the characterization of the molecular and cellular function of Stealth proteins may shed light on fundamental mechanisms of innate immune defense against microbial invasion.",

        "abstract": "Cell migration is essential in species ranging from bacteria to humans (for recent reviews, see Lauffenburger and Horwitz 1996; Mitchison and Cramer 1996; Montell 1999). In the amoebae <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, cell migration is involved in chemotaxis toward food sources and in aggregation (for review, see Devreotes and Zigmond 1988; Parent and Devreotes 1999; Chung et al. 2001). In higher vertebrates, cell migration plays crucial roles in multiple physiological and pathological processes. During embryonic and neonatal development, cell migration is crucial in morphogenetic processes such as gastrulation, cardiogenesis, and the formation of the nervous system (for review, see Hatten and Mason 1990; Rakic 1990; Hatten and Heintz 1998; Bentivoglio and Mazzarello 1999). In adult animals, cell migration is required for leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory responses (for review, see McCutcheon 1946; Harris 1954; Devreotes and Zigmond 1988). In tumoriogenesis, tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor metastasis both involve cell migration. Although it is well known that cell migration is necessary for all these processes, our understanding of mechanisms controlling cell migration is still limited. Here we briefly review the significance of neuronal migration and focus on recent studies on the directional guidance of neuronal migration, discussing the possibility that guidance mechanisms for neurons are conserved with those for other somatic cells.",

        "abstract": "Acanthamoeba infections are difficult to treat due to often late diagnosis and the lack of effective and specific therapeutic agents. The most important reason for unsuccessful therapy seems to be the existence of a double-wall cyst stage that is highly resistant to the available treatments, causing reinfections. The major components of the Acanthamoeba cyst wall are acid-resistant proteins and cellulose. The latter has been reported to be the major component of the inner cyst wall. It has been demonstrated previously that glycogen is the main source of free glucose for the synthesis of cellulose in Acanthamoeba, partly as glycogen levels fall during the encystment process. In other lower eukaryotes (e.g., Dictyostelium discoideum), glycogen phosphorylase has been reported to be the main tool used for glycogen breakdown in order to maintain the free glucose levels during the encystment process. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the regulation of the key processes involved in the Acanthamoeba encystment may be similar to the previously reported regulation mechanisms in other lower eukaryotes. The catalytic domain of the glycogen phosphorylase was silenced using RNA interference methods, and the effect of this phenomenon was assessed by light and electron microscopy analyses, calcofluor staining, expression zymogram assays, and Northern and Western blot analyses of both small interfering RNA-treated and control cells. The present report establishes the role of glycogen phosphorylase during the encystment process of Acanthamoeba. Moreover, the obtained results demonstrate that the enzyme is required for cyst wall assembly, mainly for the formation of the cell wall inner layer.",

Arguably the best understood mechanism of directedmovement is chemotaxis. Chemotaxis plays a major role in the starvationinduced multicellular development of the social amoebae Dictyostelium.Upon starvation up to 10(5) individual amoebae aggregate to form afruiting body. In this paper we review the evidence that the movement ofthe cells during all stages of Dictyostelium development is controlled bypropagating waves of cAMP which control the chemotactic movement ofthe cells. We analyse the complex interactions between cell-cell signallingresulting in cAMP waves of various geometries and cell movement whichresults in a redistribution of the signalling sources and therefore changes thegeometry of the waves. We proceed to show how the morphogenesis,including aggregation stream and mound formation, slug formation andmigration, of this relatively simple organism is beginning to be understoodat the level of rules for cell behaviour, which can be tested experimentallyand theoretically by model calculations.",

        "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a unicellular parasite that possesses a contractile vacuole complex (CVC). This organelle is usually present in free-living protists and is mainly involved in osmoregulation. However, in some organisms, like for example Dictyostelium discoideum, other roles include calcium homeostasis and transference of proteins to the plasma membrane. T. cruzi plasma membrane is very rich in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-AP) and a very important group of GPI-AP is that of the trans-sialidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of sialic acid from host glycoconjugates to mucins present in the surface of the parasite and are important for host cell invasion among other functions. We recently reported that a pathway dependent on the Rab GTPase Rab11 is involved in the traffic of trans-sialidases to the plasma membrane through the CVC of the infective stages of the parasite and that preventing this traffic results in considerable reduction in the ability of T. cruzi to infect host cells. We also found that traffic of other GPI-anchored proteins is also through the CVC but uses a Rab11-independent pathway. These represent unconventional pathways of GPI-anchored protein traffic to the plasma membrane.",

        "abstract": "Metazoan embryogenesis is controlled by a limited number of signaling modules that are used repetitively at successive developmental stages. The development of social amoebas shows similar reiterated use of cAMP-mediated signaling. In the model Dictyostelium discoideum, secreted cAMP acting on 4 cAMP receptors (cARs1-4) coordinates cell movement during aggregation and fruiting body formation, and induces the expression of aggregation and sporulation genes at consecutive developmental stages. To identify hierarchy in the multiple roles of cAMP, we investigated cAR heterogeneity and function across the social amoeba phylogeny. The gene duplications that yielded cARs 2-4 occurred late in evolution. Many species have only a cAR1 ortholog that duplicated independently in the Polysphondylids and Acytostelids. Disruption of both cAR genes of Polysphondylium pallidum (Ppal) did not affect aggregation, but caused complete collapse of fruiting body morphogenesis. The stunted structures contained disorganized stalk cells, which supported a mass of cysts instead of spores; cAMP triggered spore gene expression in Ppal, but not in the cAR null mutant, explaining its sporulation defect. Encystation is the survival strategy of solitary amoebas, and lower taxa, like Ppal, can still encyst as single cells. Recent findings showed that intracellular cAMP accumulation suffices to trigger encystation, whereas it is a complementary requirement for sporulation. Combined, the data suggest that cAMP signaling in social amoebas evolved from cAMP-mediated encystation in solitary amoebas; cAMP secretion in aggregates prompted the starving cells to form spores and not cysts, and additionally organized fruiting body morphogenesis. cAMP-mediated aggregation was the most recent innovation.",

However, the association between the virulence and survivability in the environment is unclear. In the present study, <i>L. pneumophila</i> was isolated from environmental water sites (Ashiyu foot spa, water fountain, and public bath), and the serogroups of isolated strains were determined by serological tests. Isolated strains were found to belong to serogroups SG1, SG2, SG3, SG4, SG5, SG8, SG9, and SG13. Untypeable strains were also obtained. Isolated strains were used for intracellular growth assay in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1. Among these strains, only an untypeable strain, named AY3, failed to replicate in THP-1. In addition, AY3 was maintained for a long period in an environmental water site, Ashiyu foot spa 2. Further, we compared the characteristics of several strains isolated from Ashiyu foot spa 2 and a clinical strain, Togus-1. AY3 failed to replicate in THP-1 cells but replicated in an amoeba model, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Compared with Togus-1, the culturable cell number of environmental strains under stress conditions was higher. Moreover, biofilm formation was assessed, and AY3 showed the same degree of biofilm formation as Togus-1. Biofilm formation, replication in amoebae, and resistance against stress factors would explain the predominance of AY3 at one environmental site. Although the mechanism underlying the difference in the ability of AY3 to replicate in THP-1 cells or amoebae is still unclear, AY3 may abandon the ability to replicate in THP-1 cells to survive in one environment for a long period. Understanding the mechanisms of <i>L. pneumophila</i> in replication within different hosts should help in the control of Legionnaires' disease, but further study is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) has been widely studied as a principal regulator of cell polarization, migration, and chemotaxis. Surprisingly, recent studies showed that mammalian neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum cells can polarize and migrate in the absence of PI3K activity. Here we directly probe the roles of PI3K and its downstream effector, Rac, in HL-60 neutrophils by using a chemical biology approach whereby the endogenously present enzymes are synthetically activated in less than one minute. We show that uniform activation of endogenous PI3K is sufficient to polarize previously unpolarized neutrophils and trigger effective cell migration. After a delay following symmetrical phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP(3)) production, a polarized distribution of PIP(3) was induced by positive feedback requiring actin polymerization. Pharmacological studies argue that this process does not require receptor-coupled trimeric G proteins. Contrary to the current working model, rapid activation of endogenous Rac proteins triggered effective actin polymerization but failed to feed back to PI3K to generate PIP(3) or induce cell polarization. Thus, the increase in PIP(3) concentration at the leading edge is generated by positive feedback with an AND gate logic with a PI3K-Rac-actin polymerization pathway as a first input and a PI3K initiated non-Rac pathway as a second input. This AND-gate control for cell polarization can explain how Rac can be employed for both PI3K-dependent and -independent signaling pathways coexisting in the same cell.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial nitrous oxide (N(2)O) reductase is the terminal oxidoreductase of a respiratory process that generates dinitrogen from N(2)O. To attain its functional state, the enzyme is subjected to a maturation process which involves the protein-driven synthesis of a unique copper-sulfur cluster and metallation of the binuclear Cu(A) site in the periplasm. There are seven putative maturation factors, encoded by nosA, nosD, nosF, nosY, nosL, nosX, and sco. We wanted to determine the indispensable proteins by expressing nos genes from Pseudomonas stutzeri in the nondenitrifying organism Pseudomonas putida. An in silico study of denitrifying bacteria revealed that nosL, nosX (or a homologous gene, apbE), and sco, but not nosA, coexist consistently with the N(2)O reductase structural gene and other maturation genes. Nevertheless, we found that expression of only three maturation factors (periplasmic protein NosD, cytoplasmic NosF ATPase, and the six-helix integral membrane protein NosY) together with nosRZ in trans was sufficient to produce catalytically active holo-N(2)O reductase in the nondenitrifying background. We suggest that these obligatory factors are required for Cu-S center assembly. Using a mutational approach with P. stutzeri, we also studied NosA, the Cu-containing outer membrane protein previously thought to have Cu insertase function, and ScoP, a putative membrane-anchored chaperone for Cu(A) metallation. Both of these were found to be dispensable elements for N(2)O reductase biosynthesis. Our experimental and in silico data were integrated in a model of N(2)O reductase maturation.",

Despite similar life-styles, individual species form independent starvation-induced fruiting bodies whose spores can renew the life cycle. N-glycans associated with the cell surface glycocalyx have been predicted to contribute to interspecific avoidance, resistance to pathogens, and prey preference. N-glycans from five CSM species that diverged 300-600 million years ago and whose genomes have been sequenced were fractionated into neutral and acidic pools and profiled by MALDI-TOF-MS. Glycan structure models were refined using linkage specific antibodies, exoglycosidase digestions, MALDI-MS/MS, and chromatographic studies. Amoebae of the type species Dictyostelium discoideum express modestly trimmed high mannose N-glycans variably modified with core \u03b13-linked Fuc and peripherally decorated with 0-2 residues each of \u03b2-GlcNAc, Fuc, methylphosphate and/or sulfate, as reported previously. Comparative analyses of D. purpureum, D. fasciculatum, Polysphondylium pallidum, and Actyostelium subglobosum revealed that each displays a distinctive spectrum of high-mannose species with quantitative variations in the extent of these modifications, and qualitative differences including retention of Glc, mannose methylation, and absence of a peripheral GlcNAc, fucosylation, or sulfation. Starvation-induced development modifies the pattern in all species but, except for universally observed increased mannose-trimming, the N-glycans do not converge to a common profile. Correlations with glycogene repertoires will enable future reverse genetic studies to eliminate N-glycomic differences to test their functions in interspecific relations and pathogen evasion.",

Here, the activity of one of the very few prokaryotic Dnmt2 homologs from Geobacter species (GsDnmt2) was investigated. GsDnmt2 was observed to methylate tRNA-Asp from flies and mice. Unexpectedly, it had only a weak activity toward its matching Geobacter tRNA-Asp, but methylated Geobacter tRNA-Glu with good activity. In agreement with this result, we show that tRNA-Glu is methylated in Geobacter while the methylation is absent in tRNA-Asp. The activities of Dnmt2 enzymes from Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Dictyostelium discoideum for methylation of the Geobacter tRNA-Asp and tRNA-Glu were determined showing that all these Dnmt2s preferentially methylate tRNA-Asp. Hence, the GsDnmt2 enzyme has a swapped transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) specificity. By comparing the different tRNAs, a characteristic sequence pattern was identified in the variable loop of all preferred tRNA substrates. An exchange of two nucleotides in the variable loop of murine tRNA-Asp converted it to the corresponding variable loop of tRNA-Glu and led to a strong reduction of GsDnmt2 activity. Interestingly, the same loss of activity was observed with human DNMT2, indicating that the variable loop functions as a specificity determinant in tRNA recognition of Dnmt2 enzymes.",

        "abstract": "Acidocalcisomes are acidic organelles with a high concentration of phosphorus present as pyrophosphate (PP(i)) and polyphosphate (poly P) complexed with calcium and other cations. The acidocalcisome membrane contains a number of pumps (Ca(2+)-ATPase, V-H(+)-ATPase, H(+)-PPase), exchangers (Na(+)/H(+), Ca(2+)/H(+)), and channels (aquaporins), while its matrix contains enzymes related to PP(i) and poly P metabolism. Acidocalcisomes have been observed in pathogenic, as well as non-pathogenic prokaryotes and eukaryotes, e.g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Dictyostelium discoideum. Some of the potential functions of the acidocalcisome are the storage of cations and phosphorus, the participation of phosphorus in PP(i) and poly P metabolism, calcium homeostasis, maintenance of intracellular pH homeostasis, and osmoregulation. In addition, acidocalcisomes resemble lysosome-related organelles (LRO) from mammalian cells in many of their properties. For example, we found that platelet dense granules, which are LROs, are very similar to acidocalcisomes. They share a similar size, acidic properties, and both contain PP(i), poly P, and calcium. Recent work that indicates that they also share the system for targeting of their membrane proteins through adaptor protein 3 reinforces this concept. The fact that acidocalcisomes interact with other organelles in parasitic protists, e.g. the contractile vacuole in Trypanosoma cruzi, and other vacuoles observed in Toxoplasma gondii, suggests that these cellular compartments may be associated with the endosomal/lysosomal pathway.",

Chemical methods for the preparation of isomeric methyl-containing analogues are reported and a series of co-crystal structures are used to rationalise the observed variations in their biological activity. These studies further support the view that the previously identified binding mode of blebbistatin to Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II is of relevance to its mode of action. A discussion of the role that these observations have on planning the synthesis of focused libraries of blebbistatin analogues is also provided including an assessment of possibilities by computational methods. These studies are ultimately directed at the development of novel myosin inhibitors with improved affinity and different selectivity profiles from blebbistatin itself.",

        "abstract": "The cytoskeletal, actin-binding protein talin has been previously implicated in phagocytosis in Dictyostelium discoideum and mammalian phagocytes. However, its mechanism of action during internalization is not understood. Our data confirm that endogenous talin can occasionally be found at phagosomes forming around IgG- and C3bi-opsonized red blood cells in macrophages. Remarkably, talin knockdown specifically abrogates uptake through complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18, alpha(M)beta(2) integrin) and not through the Fc gamma receptor. We show that talin physically interacts with CR3/alpha(M)beta(2) and that this interaction involves the talin head domain and residues W747 and F754 in the beta(2) integrin cytoplasmic domain. The CR3/alpha(M)beta(2)-talin head interaction controls not only talin recruitment to forming phagosomes but also CR3/alpha(M)beta(2) binding activity, both in macrophages and transfected fibroblasts. However, the talin head domain alone cannot support phagocytosis. Our results establish for the first time at least two distinct roles for talin during CR3/alpha(M)beta(2)-mediated phagocytosis, most noticeably activation of the CR3/alpha(M)beta(2) receptor and phagocytic uptake.",

Various effects of EM\u2219XGOLD, a health drink produced by EM, on life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum were described previously. Here, we report our attempt to identify the active principle, termed EMF, that brought about the observed effects. Throughout the purification processes, the presence of the active principle was monitored by promoted fruiting body formation. By liquid-liquid separation the activity was recovered in aqueous phase, which, after concentration, was further subjected to reverse-phase column chromatography. No activity was detected in any eluant, while almost all the activity was recovered in residual insoluble material. The application of conventional organic chemistry procedures to the residual fraction did not lead to any informative results. Acid treatment of the insoluble material produced air bubbles, suggesting it to be composed of some inorganic carbonate. Viewed under scanning electronmicroscope, the residue revealed spherical particles of \u03bcm size range. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy pointed to the existence, on the surface of the particles, of magnesium and, to a certain extent, of potassium. In separate experiments, acid treatment and alkali neutralization of EM\u2219XGOLD completely wiped out the stimulatory activity of fruiting body formation. These lines of evidence indicate these Mg, K-containing microparticles to be an active principle of EM culture extract.

Its analysis has given rise to a series of structural and functional studies, leading, among other things, to the discovery of the myosin interacting-heads motif (IHM). Further electron microscopy (EM) studies have shown the presence of IHM in frozen-hydrated and negatively stained thick filaments of striated, cardiac, and smooth muscle of bilaterians, most showing the IHM parallel to the filament axis. EM studies on negatively stained heavy meromyosin of different species have shown the presence of IHM on sponges, animals that lack muscle, extending the presence of IHM to metazoans. The IHM evolved about 800 MY ago in the ancestor of Metazoa, and independently with functional differences in the lineage leading to the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (Mycetozoa). This motif conveys important functional advantages, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation and ATP energy-saving mechanisms. Recent interest has focused on human IHM structure in order to understand the structural basis underlying various conditions and situations of scientific and medical interest: the hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, overfeeding control, aging and hormone deprival muscle weakness, drug design for schistosomiasis control, and conditioning exercise physiology for the training of power athletes.",

It is also critically involved in regulating growth of protozoa such as Dictyostelium discoideum, Leishmania donovani, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma evansi. Selective inhibition of Hsp90 has also been explored as an intervention strategy against important human diseases such as cancer, malaria, or trypanosomiasis. Giardia lamblia, a simple protozoan parasite of humans and animals, is an important cause of diarrheal disease with significant morbidity and some mortality in tropical countries. Here we show that the G. lamblia cytosolic hsp90 (glhsp90) is split in two similar sized fragments located 777 kb apart on the same scaffold. Intrigued by this unique arrangement, which appears to be specific for the Giardiinae, we have investigated the biosynthesis of GlHsp90. We used genome sequencing to confirm the split nature of the giardial hsp90. However, a specific antibody raised against the peptide detected a product with a mass of about 80 kDa, suggesting a post-transcriptional rescue of the genomic defect. We show evidence for the joining of the two independent Hsp90 transcripts in-trans to one long mature mRNA presumably by RNA splicing. The splicing junction carries hallmarks of classical cis-spliced introns, suggesting that the regular cis-splicing machinery may be sufficient for repair of the open reading frame. A complementary 26-nt sequence in the \"intron\" regions adjacent to the splice sites may assist in positioning the two pre-mRNAs for processing. This is the first example of post-transcriptional rescue of a split gene by trans-splicing.",

        "abstract": "The organization of microtubule arrays in the plant cell cortex involves interactions with the plasma membrane, presumably through protein bridges. We have used immunochemistry and monoclonal antibody 6G5 against a candidate bridge protein, a 90-kD tubulin binding protein (p90) from tobacco BY-2 membranes, to characterize the protein and isolate the corresponding gene. Screening an Arabidopsis cDNA expression library with the antibody 6G5 produced a partial clone encoding phospholipase D (PLD), and a full-length gene was obtained by sequencing a corresponding expressed sequence tag clone. The predicted protein of 857 amino acids contains the active sites of a phospholipid-metabolizing enzyme and a Ca(2+)-dependent lipid binding domain and is identical to Arabidopsis PLD delta. Two amino acid sequences obtained by Edman degradation of the tobacco p90 are identical to corresponding segments of a PLD sequence from tobacco. Moreover, immunoprecipitation using the antibody 6G5 and tobacco BY-2 protein extracts gave significant PLD activity, and PLD activity of tobacco BY-2 membrane proteins was enriched 6.7-fold by tubulin-affinity chromatography. In a cosedimentation assay, p90 bound and decorated microtubules. In immunofluorescence microscopy of intact tobacco BY-2 cells or lysed protoplasts, p90 colocalized with cortical microtubules, and taxol-induced microtubule bundling was accompanied by corresponding reorganization of p90. Labeling of p90 remained along the plasma membrane when microtubules were depolymerized, although detergent extraction abolished the labeling. Therefore, p90 is a specialized PLD that associates with membranes and microtubules, possibly conveying hormonal and environmental signals to the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells use dynamins-mechano-chemical GTPases--to drive the division of endosymbiotic organelles. Here we probe early steps of mitochondrial and chloroplast endosymbiosis by tracing the evolution of dynamins. We develop a parsimony-based phylogenetic method for protein sequence reconstruction, with deep time resolution. Using this, we demonstrate that dynamins diversify through the punctuated transformation of sequence segments on the scale of secondary-structural elements. We find examples of segments that have remained essentially unchanged from the 1.8-billion-y-old last eukaryotic common ancestor to the present day. Stitching these together, we reconstruct three ancestral dynamins: The first is nearly identical to the ubiquitous mitochondrial division dynamins of extant eukaryotes, the second is partially preserved in the myxovirus-resistance--like dynamins of metazoans, and the third gives rise to the cytokinetic dynamins of amoebozoans and plants and to chloroplast division dynamins. The reconstructed sequences, combined with evolutionary models and published functional data, suggest that the ancestral mitochondrial division dynamin also mediated vesicle scission. This bifunctional protein duplicated into specialized mitochondrial and vesicle variants at least three independent times--in alveolates, green algae, and the ancestor of fungi and metazoans-accompanied by the loss of the ancient prokaryotic mitochondrial division protein FtsZ. Remarkably, many extant species that retain FtsZ also retain the predicted ancestral bifunctional dynamin. The mitochondrial division apparatus of such organisms, including amoebozoans, red algae, and stramenopiles, seems preserved in a near-primordial form.",

        "abstract": "The detection of cell cycle proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains may represent an early event leading to neurodegeneration. To identify cell cycle modifiers with anti-Abeta properties, we assessed the effect of Differentiation-Inducing Factor-1 (DIF-1), a unique, small-molecule from Dictyostelium discoideum, on the proteolysis of the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) in a variety of different cell types. We show that DIF-1 slows cell cycle progression through G0/G1 that correlates with a reduction in cyclin D1 protein levels. Western blot analysis of DIF-treated cells and conditioned medium revealed decreases in the levels of secreted APP, mature APP, and C-terminal fragments. Assessment of conditioned media by sandwich ELISA showed reduced levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42, also demonstrating that treatment with DIF-1 effectively decreases the ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40. In addition, DIF-1 significantly diminished APP phosphorylation at residue T668. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis of APP residue Thr668 to alanine or glutamic acid abolished the effect of DIF-1 on APP proteolysis and restored secreted levels of Abeta. Finally, DIF-1 prevented the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments induced by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, and calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN). Our findings suggest that DIF-1 affects G0/G1-associated amyloidogenic processing of APP by a gamma-secretase-, proteasome- and calpain-insensitive pathway, and that this effect requires the presence of residue Thr668.",

        "abstract": "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) mediates protein translocation across the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae - the causative agent of cholera. All V. cholerae strains examined to date harbor gene clusters encoding a T6SS. Structural similarity and sequence homology between components of the T6SS and the T4 bacteriophage cell-puncturing device suggest that the T6SS functions as a contractile molecular syringe to inject effector molecules into prokaryotic and eukaryotic target cells. Regulation of the T6SS is critical. A subset of V. cholerae strains, including the clinical O37 serogroup strain V52, express T6SS constitutively. In contrast, pandemic strains impose tight control that can be genetically disrupted: mutations in the quorum sensing gene luxO and the newly described regulator gene tsrA lead to constitutive T6SS expression in the El Tor strain C6706. In this report, we examined environmental V. cholerae isolates from the Rio Grande with regard to T6SS regulation. Rough V. cholerae lacking O-antigen carried a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the global T6SS regulator VasH and did not display virulent behavior towards Escherichia coli and other environmental bacteria. In contrast, smooth V. cholerae strains engaged constitutively in type VI-mediated secretion and displayed virulence towards prokaryotes (E. coli and other environmental bacteria) and a eukaryote (the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum). Furthermore, smooth V. cholerae strains were able to outcompete each other in a T6SS-dependent manner. The work presented here suggests that constitutive T6SS expression provides V. cholerae with an advantage in intraspecific and interspecific competition.",

The cells within the biofilm are surrounded by ECM which provides structural integrity and protection. During an infection, this protection is mainly against cells of the immune system and antifungal drugs. <i>A. fumigatus</i> forms biofilms during static growth on a solid substratum and in chronic aspergillosis infections. It is important to understand how, and which, <i>A. fumigatus</i> signal transduction pathways are important for the adhesion and biofilm formation in a host during infection. Here we investigated the role of MAP kinases and protein phosphatases in biofilm formation. The loss of the MAP kinases MpkA, MpkC and SakA had an impact on the cell surface and the ECM during biofilm formation and reduced the adherence of <i>A. fumigatus</i> to polystyrene and fibronectin-coated plates. The phosphatase null mutants \u0394<i>sitA</i> and \u0394<i>ptcB,</i> involved in regulation of MpkA and SakA phosphorylation, influenced cell wall carbohydrate exposure. Moreover, we characterized the <i>A. fumigatus</i> protein phosphatase PphA. The <i>\u0394pphA</i> strain was more sensitive to cell wall-damaging agents, had increased \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan and reduced chitin, decreased conidia phagocytosis by <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> and reduced adhesion and biofilm formation. Finally, \u0394<i>pphA</i> strain was avirulent in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and increased the released of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) from bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs).

        "abstract": "Myosin motor proteins convert chemical energy into force and movement through their interactions with nucleotide and filamentous actin (F-actin). The evolutionarily conserved lysine-265 (K265) of the myosin-2 motor from Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) is proposed to be a key residue in an allosteric communication pathway that mediates actin-nucleotide coupling. To better understand the role of K265, point mutations were introduced within the Dd myosin-2 M765-2R framework, replacing this lysine with alanine (K265A), glutamic acid (K265E) or glutamine (K265Q), and the functional and kinetic properties of the resulting myosin motors were assessed. The alanine and glutamic acid substitutions reduced actin-activated ATPase activity, slowed the in vitro sliding velocity and attenuated the inhibitory potential of the allosteric myosin inhibitor pentabromopseudilin (PBP). However, glutamine substitution did not substantially change these parameters. Structural modelling suggests that K265 interacts with D590 and Q633 to establish a pivotal allosteric branching point. Based on our results, we propose: (1) that the K265-D590 interaction functions to reduce myosins basal ATPase activity in the absence of F-actin, and (2) that the dynamic formation of the K265-Q633 salt bridge upon actin cleft closure regulates the activation of product release by actin filaments.",

        "abstract": "Photoreactive compounds are important tools in life sciences that allow precisely timed covalent crosslinking of ligands and targets. Using a unique technique we have synthesized azidoblebbistatin, which is a derivative of blebbistatin, the most widely used myosin inhibitor. Without UV irradiation azidoblebbistatin exhibits identical inhibitory properties to those of blebbistatin. Using UV irradiation, azidoblebbistatin can be covalently crosslinked to myosin, which greatly enhances its in vitro and in vivo effectiveness. Photo-crosslinking also eliminates limitations associated with the relatively low myosin affinity and water solubility of blebbistatin. The wavelength used for photo-crosslinking is not toxic for cells and tissues, which confers a great advantage in in vivo tests. Because the crosslink results in an irreversible association of the inhibitor to myosin and the irradiation eliminates the residual activity of unbound inhibitor molecules, azidoblebbistatin has a great potential to become a highly effective tool in both structural studies of actomyosin contractility and the investigation of cellular and physiological functions of myosin II. We used azidoblebbistatin to identify previously unknown low-affinity targets of the inhibitor (EC(50) \u2265 50 \u03bcM) in Dictyostelium discoideum, while the strongest interactant was found to be myosin II (EC(50) = 5 \u03bcM). Our results demonstrate that azidoblebbistatin, and potentially other azidated drugs, can become highly useful tools for the identification of strong- and weak-binding cellular targets and the determination of the apparent binding affinities in in vivo conditions.",

In this work, we found that the absence of EnhC resulted in defective intracellular growth when dissemination of intracellular bacteria to neighbouring cells was expected to occur. No such defect was observed during growth within the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Culture supernatants containing the secreted products of infected macrophages added to host cells restricted the growth of the DeltaenhC strain, while tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), at concentrations similar to those found in macrophage culture supernatants, could reproduce the growth restriction exerted by culture supernatants on L. pneumophilaDeltaenhC. The absence of EnhC also caused defective trafficking of the Legionella-containing vacuole in TNF-alpha-treated macrophages. EnhC was shown to be an envelope-associated protein largely localized to the periplasm, with its expression induced in post-exponential phase, as is true for many virulence-associated proteins. Furthermore, the absence of EnhC appeared to affect survival under stress conditions, as the DeltaenhC mutant was more susceptible to H(2)O(2) treatment than the wild-type strain. EnhC therefore is a unique virulence factor that is required for growth specifically when macrophages have heightened potential to restrict microbial replication.",

        "abstract": "We identify the SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase (STUbL) family of proteins and propose that STUbLs selectively ubiquitinate sumoylated proteins and proteins that contain SUMO-like domains (SLDs). STUbL recruitment to sumoylated/SLD proteins is mediated by tandem SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) within the STUbLs N-terminus. STUbL-mediated ubiquitination maintains sumoylation pathway homeostasis by promoting target protein desumoylation and/or degradation. Thus, STUbLs establish a novel mode of communication between the sumoylation and ubiquitination pathways. STUbLs are evolutionarily conserved and include: Schizosaccharomyces pombe Slx8-Rfp (founding member), Homo sapiens RNF4, Dictyostelium discoideum MIP1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Slx5-Slx8. Cells lacking Slx8-Rfp accumulate sumoylated proteins, display genomic instability, and are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. These phenotypes are suppressed by deletion of the major SUMO ligase Pli1, demonstrating the specificity of STUbLs as regulators of sumoylated proteins. Notably, human RNF4 expression restores SUMO pathway homeostasis in fission yeast lacking Slx8-Rfp, underscoring the evolutionary functional conservation of STUbLs. The DNA repair factor Rad60 and its human homolog NIP45, which contain SLDs, are candidate STUbL targets. Consistently, Rad60 and Slx8-Rfp mutants have similar DNA repair defects.",

The wide range of applications as well as the important functions these structures play in almost all biological processes highlight the need for a detailed understanding of the factors that control coiled-coil folding and oligomerization. Here, we address the important and unresolved question why the presence of particular oligomerization-state determinants within a coiled coil does frequently not correlate with its topology. We found an unexpected, general link between coiled-coil oligomerization-state specificity and trigger sequences, elements that are indispensable for coiled-coil formation. By using the archetype coiled-coil domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 as a model system, we show that well-established trimer-specific oligomerization-state determinants switch the peptide's topology from a dimer to a trimer only when inserted into the trigger sequence. We successfully confirmed our results in two other, unrelated coiled-coil dimers, ATF1 and cortexillin-1. We furthermore show that multiple topology determinants can coexist in the same trigger sequence, revealing a delicate balance of the resulting oligomerization state by position-dependent forces. Our experimental results should significantly improve the prediction of the oligomerization state of coiled coils. They therefore should have major implications for the rational design of coiled coils and consequently many applications using these popular oligomerization domains.",

        "title": "Phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic NEET proteins uncovers a link between a key gene duplication event and the evolution of vertebrates.",
        "abstract": "NEET proteins belong to a unique family of iron-sulfur proteins in which the 2Fe-2S cluster is coordinated by a CDGSH domain that is followed by the \"NEET\" motif. They are involved in the regulation of iron and reactive oxygen metabolism, and have been associated with the progression of diabetes, cancer, aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their important biological functions, the evolution and diversification of eukaryotic NEET proteins are largely unknown. Here we used the three members of the human NEET protein family (CISD1, mitoNEET; CISD2, NAF-1 or Miner 1; and CISD3, Miner2) as our guides to conduct a phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic NEET proteins and their evolution. Our findings identified the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum's CISD proteins as the closest to the ancient archetype of eukaryotic NEET proteins. We further identified CISD3 homologs in fungi that were previously reported not to contain any NEET proteins, and revealed that plants lack homolog(s) of CISD3. Furthermore, our study suggests that the mammalian NEET proteins, mitoNEET (CISD1) and NAF-1 (CISD2), emerged via gene duplication around the origin of vertebrates. Our findings provide new insights into the classification and expansion of the NEET protein family, as well as offer clues to the diverged functions of the human mitoNEET and NAF-1 proteins.",

        "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging cause of nosocomial infections. The isolation of strains resistant to multiple antibiotics is increasing at alarming rates. Although A. baumannii is considered as one of the more threatening \"superbugs\" for our healthcare system, little is known about the factors contributing to its pathogenesis. In this work we show that A. baumannii ATCC 17978 possesses an O-glycosylation system responsible for the glycosylation of multiple proteins. 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry methods identified seven A. baumannii glycoproteins, of yet unknown function. The glycan structure was determined using a combination of MS and NMR techniques and consists of a branched pentasaccharide containing N-acetylgalactosamine, glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and a derivative of glucuronic acid. A glycosylation deficient strain was generated by homologous recombination. This strain did not show any growth defects, but exhibited a severely diminished capacity to generate biofilms. Disruption of the glycosylation machinery also resulted in reduced virulence in two infection models, the amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum and the larvae of the insect Galleria mellonella, and reduced in vivo fitness in a mouse model of peritoneal sepsis. Despite A. baumannii genome plasticity, the O-glycosylation machinery appears to be present in all clinical isolates tested as well as in all of the genomes sequenced. This suggests the existence of a strong evolutionary pressure to retain this system. These results together indicate that O-glycosylation in A. baumannii is required for full virulence and therefore represents a novel target for the development of new antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "We determined the 1.17 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of a hybrid peptide based on sequences from coiled-coil regions of the proteins GCN4 and cortexillin I. The peptide forms a parallel homodimeric coiled-coil, with C(alpha) backbone geometry similar to GCN4 (rmsd value 0.71 A). Three stabilizing interactions have been identified: a unique hydrogen bonding-electrostatic network not previously observed in coiled-coils, and two other hydrophobic interactions involving leucine residues at positions e and g from both g-a' and d-e' interchain interactions with the hydrophobic core. This is also the first report of the quantitative significance of these interactions. The GCN4/cortexillin hybrid surprisingly has two interchain Glu-Lys' ion pairs that form a hydrogen bonding network with the Asn residues in the core. This network, which was not observed for the reversed Lys-Glu' pair in GCN4, increases the combined stability contribution of each Glu-Lys' salt bridge across the central Asn15-Asn15' core to approximately 0.7 kcal/mole, compared to approximately 0.4 kcal mole(-1) from a Glu-Lys' salt bridge on its own. In addition to electrostatic and hydrogen bonding stabilization of the coiled-coil, individual leucine residues at positions e and g in the hybrid peptide also contribute to stability by 0.7 kcal/mole relative to alanine. These interactions are of critical importance to understanding the stability requirements for coiled-coil folding and in modulating the stability of de novo designed macromolecules containing this motif.",

The discoidin domain has been identified in mammalian milk fat globule membrane proteins, blood coagulation factors, and receptor tyrosine kinases, where it may facilitate cell aggregation, adhesion, or cell-cell recognition. Here we show that ACLP is a secreted protein that associates with the extracellular matrix (ECM). During mouse embryogenesis, ACLP is abundantly expressed in the ECM of collagen-rich tissues, including the vasculature, dermis, and the developing skeleton. We deleted the ACLP gene in mice by homologous recombination. The majority of ACLP(-/-) mice die perinatally due to gastroschisis, a severe disruption of the anterior abdominal wall and herniation of the abdominal organs. ACLP(-/-) mice that survived to adulthood developed nonhealing skin wounds. Following injury by a dermal punch biopsy, ACLP(-/-) mice exhibited deficient wound healing compared with controls. In addition, dermal fibroblasts isolated from ACLP(-/-) 18.5-day-postconception embryos exhibited a reduced proliferative capacity compared with wild-type cells. These results indicate that ACLP is an ECM protein that is essential for embryonic development and dermal wound healing processes.",

        "abstract": "Fusion proteins containing the Src homology (SH)3 domains of Dictyostelium myosin IB (myoB) and IC (myoC) bind a 116-kD protein (p116), plus nine other proteins identified as the seven member Arp2/3 complex, and the alpha and beta subunits of capping protein. Immunoprecipitation reactions indicate that myoB and myoC form a complex with p116, Arp2/3, and capping protein in vivo, that the myosins bind to p116 through their SH3 domains, and that capping protein and the Arp2/3 complex in turn bind to p116. Cloning of p116 reveals a protein dominated by leucine-rich repeats and proline-rich sequences, and indicates that it is a homologue of Acan 125. Studies using p116 fusion proteins confirm the location of the myosin I SH3 domain binding site, implicate NH(2)-terminal sequences in binding capping protein, and show that a region containing a short sequence found in several G-actin binding proteins, as well as an acidic stretch, can activate Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation. p116 localizes along with the Arp2/3 complex, myoB, and myoC in dynamic actin-rich cellular extensions, including the leading edge of cells undergoing chemotactic migration, and dorsal, cup-like, macropinocytic extensions. Cells lacking p116 exhibit a striking defect in the formation of these macropinocytic structures, a concomitant reduction in the rate of fluid phase pinocytosis, a significant decrease in the efficiency of chemotactic aggregation, and a decrease in cellular F-actin content. These results identify a complex that links key players in the nucleation and termination of actin filament assembly with a ubiquitous barbed end-directed motor, indicate that the protein responsible for the formation of this complex is physiologically important, and suggest that previously reported myosin I mutant phenotypes in Dictyostelium may be due, at least in part, to defects in the assembly state of actin. We propose that p116 and Acan 125, along with homologues identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and man, be named CARMIL proteins, for capping protein, Arp2/3, and myosin I linker.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protist parasite of warm-blooded animals that causes disease by proliferating intracellularly in muscle and the central nervous system. Previous studies showed that a prolyl 4-hydroxylase related to animal HIF\u03b1 prolyl hydroxylases is required for optimal parasite proliferation, especially at low O2. We also observed that Pro-154 of Skp1, a subunit of the Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box protein (SCF)-class of E3-ubiquitin ligases, is a natural substrate of this enzyme. In an unrelated protist, Dictyostelium discoideum, Skp1 hydroxyproline is modified by five sugars via the action of three glycosyltransferases, Gnt1, PgtA, and AgtA, which are required for optimal O2-dependent development. We show here that TgSkp1 hydroxyproline is modified by a similar pentasaccharide, based on mass spectrometry, and that assembly of the first three sugars is dependent on Toxoplasma homologs of Gnt1 and PgtA. Reconstitution of the glycosyltransferase reactions in extracts with radioactive sugar nucleotide substrates and appropriate Skp1 glycoforms, followed by chromatographic analysis of acid hydrolysates of the reaction products, confirmed the predicted sugar identities as GlcNAc, Gal, and Fuc. Disruptions of gnt1 or pgtA resulted in decreased parasite growth. Off target effects were excluded based on restoration of the normal glycan chain and growth upon genetic complementation. By analogy to Dictyostelium Skp1, the mechanism may involve regulation of assembly of the SCF complex. Understanding the mechanism of Toxoplasma Skp1 glycosylation is expected to help develop it as a drug target for control of the pathogen, as the glycosyltransferases are absent from mammalian hosts.",

        "abstract": "Stable, single alpha-helix (SAH) domains are widely distributed in the proteome, including in myosins, but their functions are unknown. To test whether SAH domains can act as levers, we replaced four of the six calmodulin-binding IQ motifs in the levers of mouse myosin 5a (Myo5) with the putative SAH domain of Dictyostelium myosin MyoM of similar length. The SAH domain was inserted between the IQ motifs and the coiled coil in a Myo5 HMM construct in which the levers were truncated from six to two IQ motifs (Myo5-2IQ). Electron microscopy of this chimera (Myo5-2IQ-SAH) showed the SAH domain was straight and 17 nm long as predicted, restoring the truncated lever to the length of wild-type (Myo5-6IQ). The powerstroke (of 21.5 nm) measured in the optical trap was slightly less than that for Myo5-6IQ but much greater than for Myo5-2IQ. Myo5-2IQ-SAH moved processively along actin at physiological ATP concentrations with similar stride and run lengths to Myo5-6IQ in in-vitro single molecule assays. In comparison, Myo5-2IQ is not processive under these conditions. Solution biochemical experiments indicated that the rear head did not mechanically gate the rate of ADP release from the lead head, unlike Myo5-6IQ. These data show that the SAH domain can form part of a functional lever in myosins, although its mechanical stiffness might be lower. More generally, we conclude that SAH domains can act as stiff structural extensions in aqueous solution and this structural role may be important in other proteins.",

        "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control important aspects of asexual and sexual development in eukaryotic organisms. We have identified a predicted GPCR in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa with similarity to cyclic AMP-receptor like GPCRs from Dictyostelium discoideum and GCR1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of gpr-1 is highest in female reproductive structures, and deletion of gpr-1 leads to defects during sexual development. Unfertilized female structures (protoperithecia) from Deltagpr-1 strains are weakly pigmented, small, and submerged in the agar. The perithecia produced after fertilization have deformed beaks that lack ostioles, the openings through which ascospores are discharged. Localization studies using a GPR-1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed that GPR-1 is targeted to female reproductive structures. Genetic epistasis experiments with the three Galpha genes were inconclusive due to the early block in mating exhibited by Deltagna-1 strains. Phenotypic analysis of mutants from a high-throughput N. crassa knockout project allowed identification of BEK-1, a homeodomain transcription factor that is a potential target of GPR-1. The perithecial defects of Deltabek-1 strains are similar to those of the Deltagpr-1 strain, and epistasis analysis indicates that bek-1 could function downstream of gpr-1 during postfertilization events. The effect must be posttranscriptional, as bek-1 transcript levels are not affected in Deltagpr-1 strains. The lack of ostioles in Deltagpr-1 and Deltabek-1 mutants has an undesirable effect on the ability to spread progeny (ascospores) by the normal ejection mechanism and would severely compromise the fitness of these strains in nature.",

        "abstract": "Studies of mice suggest that pneumococcal proteins, including PspA, pneumolysin, PsaA, and CbpA, are promising vaccine candidates. To determine whether these proteins are good mucosal immunogens in humans, adenoidal lymphocytes from 20 children who had adenoidectomies were isolated and tested by ELISpot for antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Cells were also cultured for 7 days in the presence of a concentrated culture supernatant (CCS) from a type 14 strain of pneumococcus which contained secreted pneumococcal proteins, including PspA, pneumolysin, PsaA, and CbpA, and then tested by ELISpot. ELISpot assays done on freshly isolated cells detected ASCs to all four antigens in most children studied. However, there were differences both between antigens and between isotypes. The densities of immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCs against both PsaA and CbpA were significantly higher than those of ASCs for PspA and PdB (pneumolysin toxoid B) (P < 0.001). For all antigens, the numbers of IgA ASCs tended to be lower than those of both IgG and IgM ASCs. The numbers of anti-CbpA and -PsaA IgA ASCs were higher than those of anti-PdB IgA ASCs (P < 0.01). Concentrations of IgA antibodies to PspA and PsaA in saliva correlated with the numbers of IgA ASCs to PspA and PsaA in freshly isolated adenoidal cells, but no such correlation was found between salivary IgG antibody concentrations and IgG ASCs to the four antigens in adenoidal cells. In cultured cells, anti-PspA, -PsaA, and -CbpA IgG ASCs proliferated significantly, but only two of eight samples showed >2-fold increases in anti-CbpA and -PspA IgA ASCs after CCS stimulation. The results suggest that CbpA, PsaA, and PspA may be good upper respiratory mucosal antigens in children. Adenoids may be important inductive sites for memory IgG responses and important sources of salivary IgA. Some protein antigens may also prime for mucosal IgA memory. These data support the effort to explore mucosal immunization against pneumococcal infection.",

Here we report that the neuronal Ca2+-binding protein 1 (CaBP1) modulates Ca(v)2.1 channels in a manner that is markedly different from modulation by CaM. CaBP1 enhances inactivation, causes a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and does not support Ca2+-dependent facilitation of Ca(v)2.1 channels. These inhibitory effects of CaBP1 do not require Ca2+, but depend on the CaM-binding domain in the alpha1 subunit of Ca(v)2.1 channels (alpha12.1). CaBP1 binds to the CaM-binding domain, co-immunoprecipitates with alpha12.1 from transfected cells and brain extracts, and colocalizes with alpha12.1 in discrete microdomains of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Our results identify an interaction between Ca2+ channels and CaBP1 that may regulate Ca2+-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity by inhibiting Ca2+ influx into neurons.",

        "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has complex, naturally variable behavioral responses to environmental oxygen, food, and other animals. C. elegans detects oxygen through soluble guanylate cyclase homologs (sGCs) and responds to it differently depending on the activity of the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1: npr-1(lf) and naturally isolated npr-1(215F) animals avoid high oxygen and aggregate in the presence of food; npr-1(215V) animals do not. We show here that hyperoxia avoidance integrates food with npr-1 activity through neuromodulation of a distributed oxygen-sensing network. Hyperoxia avoidance is stimulated by sGC-expressing oxygen-sensing neurons, nociceptive neurons, and ADF sensory neurons. In npr-1(215V) animals, the switch from weak aerotaxis on food to strong aerotaxis in its absence requires close regulation of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the ADF neurons; high levels of ADF serotonin promote hyperoxia avoidance. In npr-1(lf) animals, food regulation is masked by increased activity of the oxygen-sensing neurons. Hyperoxia avoidance is also regulated by the neuronal TGF-beta homolog DAF-7, a secreted mediator of crowding and stress responses. DAF-7 inhibits serotonin synthesis in ADF, suggesting that ADF serotonin is a convergence point for regulation of hyperoxia avoidance. Coalitions of neurons that promote and repress hyperoxia avoidance generate a subtle and flexible response to environmental oxygen.",

        "abstract": "We identified in the Entamoeba histolytica genome a family of over 80 putative transmembrane kinases (TMKs). The TMK extracellular domains had significant similarity to the intermediate subunit (Igl) of the parasite Gal/GalNAc lectin. The closest homolog to the E. histolytica TMK kinase domain was a cytoplasmic dual-specificity kinase, SplA, from Dictyostelium discoideum. Sequence analysis of the TMK family demonstrated similarities to both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. TMK genes from each of six phylogenetic groups were expressed as mRNA in trophozoites, as assessed by spotted oligoarray and real-time PCR assays, suggesting nonredundant functions of the TMK groups for sensing and responding to extracellular stimuli. Additionally, we observed changes in the expression profile of the TMKs in continuous culture. Antisera produced against the conserved kinase domain identified proteins of the expected molecular masses of the expressed TMKs. Confocal microscopy with anti-TMK kinase antibodies revealed a focal distribution of the TMKs on the cytoplasmic face of the trophozoite plasma membrane. We conclude that E. histolytica expresses members of each subgroup of TMKs. The presence of multiple receptor kinases in the plasma membrane offers for the first time a potential explanation of the ability of the parasite to respond to the changing environment of the host.",

Basal disk differentiation and robust stalk formation require the morphogen DIF-1, synthesized by the polyketide synthase StlB, the des-methyl-DIF-1 methyltransferase DmtA, and the chlorinase ChlA, which are conserved throughout Dictyostelia. To understand how the basal disk and other innovations evolved in group 4, we sequenced and annotated the Polysphondylium violaceum (Pvio) genome, performed cell type-specific transcriptomics to identify cell-type marker genes, and developed transformation and gene knock-out procedures for Pvio. We used the novel methods to delete the Pvio stlB gene. The Pvio stlB- mutants formed misshapen curly sorogens with thick and irregular stalks. As fruiting body formation continued, the upper stalks became more regular, but structures contained 40% less spores. The stlB- sorogens overexpressed a stalk gene and underexpressed a (pre)spore gene. Normal fruiting body formation and sporulation were restored in Pvio stlB- by including DIF-1 in the supporting agar. These data indicate that, although conserved, stlB and its product(s) acquired both a novel role in the group 4 Dictyostelia and a role opposite to that in its sister group.",

Lack of highly active and specific tyrosine ammonia-lyases has previously been a limitation in metabolic engineering approaches. We therefore identified 22 sequences in silico using synteny information and aiming for sequence divergence. We performed a comparative in vivo study, expressing the genes intracellularly in bacteria and yeast. When produced heterologously, some enzymes resulted in significantly higher production of p-coumaric acid in several different industrially important production organisms. Three novel enzymes were found to have activity exclusively for phenylalanine, including an enzyme from the low-GC Gram-positive bacterium Brevibacillus laterosporus, a bacterial-type enzyme from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, and a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from the moss Physcomitrella patens (producing 230 \u03bcM cinnamic acid per unit of optical density at 600 nm [OD600]) in the medium using Escherichia coli as the heterologous host). Novel tyrosine ammonia-lyases having higher reported substrate specificity than previously characterized enzymes were also identified. Enzymes from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus and Flavobacterium johnsoniae resulted in high production of p-coumaric acid in Escherichia coli (producing 440 \u03bcM p-coumaric acid OD600 unit(-1) in the medium) and in Lactococcus lactis. The enzymes were also efficient in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where p-coumaric acid accumulation was improved 5-fold over that in strains expressing previously characterized tyrosine ammonia-lyases.",

Wild-type PakB displayed a cytosolic distribution with a modest enrichment at the leading edge of migrating cells and at macropinocytic and phagocytic cups, sites consistent with a role in activating myosin I. PakB fused at the N terminus to green fluorescent protein was proteolyzed in cells, resulting in removal of the catalytic domain. C-terminal truncated PakB and activated PakB lacking the p21-binding domain strongly localized to the cell cortex, to macropinocytic cups, to the posterior of migrating cells, and to the cleavage furrow of dividing cells. These data indicate that in its open, active state, the N terminus of PakB forms a tight association with cortical actin filaments. PakB-null cells displayed no significant behavioral defects, but cells expressing activated PakB were unable to complete cytokinesis when grown in suspension and exhibited increased rates of phagocytosis and pinocytosis.",

Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility. Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins, Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene.",

        "abstract": "The reliability of evolutionary reconstructions based on the fossil record critically depends on our knowledge of the factors affecting the fossilization of soft-bodied organisms. Despite considerable research effort, these factors are still poorly understood. In order to elucidate the main prerequisites for the preservation of soft-bodied organisms, we conducted long-term (1-5\u00a0years) taphonomic experiments with the model crustacean <i>Artemia salina</i> buried in five different sediments. The subsequent analysis of the carcasses and sediments revealed that, in our experimental settings, better preservation was associated with the fast deposition of aluminum and silicon on organic tissues. Other elements such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, which can also accumulate quickly on the carcasses, appear to be much less efficient in preventing decay. Next, we asked if the carcasses of uni- and multicellular organisms differ in their ability to accumulate aluminum ions on their surface. The experiments with the flagellate <i>Euglena gracilis</i> and the sponge <i>Spongilla lacustris</i> showed that aluminum ions are more readily deposited onto a multicellular body. This was further confirmed by the experiments with uni- and multicellular stages of the social ameba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. The results lead us to speculate that the evolution of cell adhesion molecules, which provide efficient cell-cell and cell-substrate binding, probably can explain the rich fossil record of soft-bodied animals, the comparatively poor fossil record of nonskeletal unicellular eukaryotes, and the explosive emergence of the Cambrian diversity of soft-bodied fossils.",

        "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of fatal chronic lung infections among individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). During the past 15 years, particularly aggressive strains transmitted among CF patients have been identified, initially in Europe and more recently in Canada. The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.",

Moreover, animal tissues undergoing regeneration also exhibit properties of embryonic systems such as the self-organization process that rebuilds tissue complexity and function. We speculated that the recreation in vitro of the biological, biophysical, and biomechanical conditions similar to those of a regenerative milieu could elicit the intrinsic capacity of differentiated cells to proceed to the development of a tissue-like structure. Here we show that, when primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts are cultured in a soft nanofiber scaffold, they establish a cellular network that causes an organized cell contraction,proliferation, and migration that ends in the formation of a symmetrically bilateral structure with a distinct central axis. A subset of mesodermal genes (brachyury, Sox9, Runx2) is upregulated during this morphogenetic process. The expression of brachyury was localized first at the central axis, extending then to both sides of the structure. The spontaneous formation of cartilage-like tissue mainly at the paraxial zone followed expression ofSox9 and Runx2. Because cellular self-organization is an intrinsic property of the tissues undergoing development,this model could lead to new ways to consider tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

The chemotaxis defect of WASp-deficient cells and its activation by Cdc42 in vivo suggest that WASp plays a role in directional sensing, however, its precise role in macrophage chemotaxis is still unclear. Using shRNA-mediated downregulation of WASp in the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW/LR5 (shWASp), we found that WASp was responsible for the initial wave of actin polymerization in response to global stimulation with CSF-1, which in Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae and carcinoma cells has been correlated with the ability to migrate towards chemoattractants. Real-time monitoring of shWASp cells, as well as WASp\u207b/\u207b bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), in response to a CSF-1 gradient revealed that the protrusions from WASp-deficient cells were directional, showing intact directional sensing. However, the protrusions from WASp-deficient cells demonstrated reduced persistence compared to their respective control shRNA and wild-type cells. Further examination showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of WASp was required for both the first wave of actin polymerization following global CSF-1 stimulation and proper directional responses towards CSF-1. Importantly, the PI3K, Rac1 and WAVE2 proteins were incorporated normally in CSF-1 - elicited protrusions in the absence of WASp, suggesting that membrane protrusion driven by the WAVE2 complex signaling is intact. Collectively, these results suggest that WASp and its phosphorylation play critical roles in coordinating the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements necessary for the persistence of protrusions required for directional migration of macrophages towards CSF-1.",

Ethanol has been found to increase the virulence of A. baumannii in Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans models of infection. To better understand the causes of this effect, we examined the transcriptional profile of A. baumannii grown in the presence or absence of ethanol using RNA-Seq. Using the Illumina/Solexa platform, a total of 43,453,960 reads (35 nt) were obtained, of which 3,596,474 mapped uniquely to the genome. Our analysis revealed that ethanol induces the expression of 49 genes that belong to different functional categories. A strong induction was observed for genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that ethanol is efficiently assimilated. In addition, we detected the induction of genes encoding stress proteins, including upsA, hsp90, groEL and lon as well as permeases, efflux pumps and a secreted phospholipase C. In stationary phase, ethanol strongly induced several genes involved with iron assimilation and a high-affinity phosphate transport system, indicating that A. baumannii makes a better use of the iron and phosphate resources in the medium when ethanol is used as a carbon source. To evaluate the role of phospholipase C (Plc1) in virulence, we generated and analyzed a deletion mutant for plc1. This strain exhibits a modest, but reproducible, reduction in the cytotoxic effect caused by A. baumannii on epithelial cells, suggesting that phospholipase C is important for virulence. Overall, our results indicate the power of applying RNA-Seq to identify key modulators of bacterial pathogenesis. We suggest that the effect of ethanol on the virulence of A. baumannii is multifactorial and includes a general stress response and other specific components such as phospholipase C.",

        "abstract": "Here we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) from Trypanosoma brucei (TbPDE2B). Using a bioinformatic approach, two different expressed sequence tag clones were identified and used to isolate the complete sequence of two identical PDE genes arranged in tandem. Each gene consists of 2,793 bases that predict a protein of 930 aa with a molecular mass of 103.2 kDa. Two GAF (for cGMP binding and stimulated PDEs, Anabaena adenylyl cyclases, and Escherichia coli FhlA) domains, similar to those contained in many signaling molecules including mammalian PDE2, PDE5, PDE6, PDE10, and PDE11, were located N-terminal to a consensus PDE catalytic domain. The catalytic domain is homologous to the catalytic domain of all 11 mammalian PDEs, the Dictyostelium discoideum RegA, and a probable PDE from Caenorhabditis elegans. It is most similar to the T. brucei PDE2A (89% identity). TbPDE2B has substrate specificity for cAMP with a K(m) of 2.4 microM. cGMP is not hydrolyzed by TbPDE2B nor does this cyclic nucleotide modulate cAMP PDE activity. The nonselective PDE inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, papaverine and pentoxifyline are poor inhibitors of TbPDE2B. Similarly, PDE inhibitors selective for the mammalian PDE families 2, 3, 5, and 6 (erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]-adenine, enoximone, zaprinast, and sildenafil) were also unable to inhibit this enzyme. However, dipyridamole was a reasonably good inhibitor of this enzyme with an IC50 of 27 microM. cAMP plays key roles in cell growth and differentiation in this parasite, and PDEs are responsible for the hydrolysis of this important second messenger. Therefore, parasite PDEs, including this one, have the potential to be attractive targets for selective drug design.",

        "abstract": "Long regulatory elements (LREs), such as CpG islands, polydA:dT tracts or AU-rich elements, are thought to play key roles in gene regulation but, as opposed to conventional binding sites of transcription factors, few methods have been proposed to formally and automatically characterize them. We present here a computational approach named DExTER (Domain Exploration To Explain gene Regulation) dedicated to the identification of candidate LREs (cLREs) and apply it to the analysis of the genomes of P. falciparum and other eukaryotes. Our analyses show that all tested genomes contain several cLREs that are somewhat conserved along evolution, and that gene expression can be predicted with surprising accuracy on the basis of these long regions only. Regulation by cLREs exhibits very different behaviours depending on species and conditions. In P. falciparum and other Apicomplexan organisms as well as in Dictyostelium discoideum, the process appears highly dynamic, with different cLREs involved at different phases of the life cycle. For multicellular organisms, the same cLREs are involved in all tissues, but a dynamic behavior is observed along embryonic development stages. In P. falciparum, whose genome is known to be strongly depleted of transcription factors, cLREs are predictive of expression with an accuracy above 70%, and our analyses show that they are associated with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation signals. Moreover, we assessed the biological relevance of one LRE discovered by DExTER in P. falciparum using an in vivo reporter assay. The source code (python) of DExTER is available at https://gite.lirmm.fr/menichelli/DExTER.",

        "abstract": "The Galpha protein Gpa1 governs the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and plays a central role in virulence and differentiation in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, but the signals and receptors that trigger this pathway were unknown. We identified seven putative proteins that share identity with known G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). One protein, Gpr4, shares limited sequence identity with the Dictyostelium discoideum cAMP receptor cAR1 and the Aspergillus nidulans GPCR protein GprH and also shares structural similarity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae receptor Gpr1. gpr4 mutants exhibited reduced capsule production and mating defects, similar to gpa1 mutants, and exogenous cAMP suppressed both gpr4 mutant phenotypes. Epistasis analysis provides further evidence that Gpr4 functions upstream of the Galpha subunit Gpa1. Gpr4-Gpr4 homomeric interactions were observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay, and Gpr4 was shown to physically interact with Gpa1 in the split-ubiquitin system. A Gpr4::DsRED fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane and methionine was found to trigger receptor internalization. The analysis of intracellular cAMP levels showed that gpr4 mutants still respond to glucose but not to certain amino acids, such as methionine. Amino acids might serve as ligands for Gpr4 and could contribute to engage the cAMP-PKA pathway. Activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway by glucose and amino acids represents a nutrient coincidence detection system shared in other pathogenic fungi.",

        "abstract": "Missense mutations in the membrane-binding actin-based motor protein, myosin-1a (Myo1a), have recently been linked to sensorineural deafness in humans. One of these mutations, E385D, impacts a residue in the switch II region of the motor domain that is present in virtually all members of the myosin superfamily. We sought to examine the impact of E385D on the function of Myo1a, both in terms of mechanochemical activity and ability to target to actin-rich microvilli in polarized epithelial cells. While E385D-Myo1a demonstrated actin-activated ATPase activity, the V(MAX) was reduced threefold relative to wild-type. Despite maintaining an active mechanochemical cycle, E385D-Myo1a was unable to move actin in the sliding filament assay. Intriguingly, when an enhanced-green-fluorescent-protein-tagged form of E385D-Myo1a was stably expressed in polarized epithelial cells, this mutation abolished the microvillar targeting normally demonstrated by wild-type Myo1a. Notably, these data are the first to suggest that mechanical activity is essential for proper localization of Myo1a in microvilli. These studies also provide a unique example of how even the most mild substitution of invariant switch II residues can effectively uncouple enzymatic and mechanical activity of the myosin motor domain.",

Biol. 260, 492-505), in the indirect flight muscle of Drosophila impaired its flight, even when three copies of the wild-type gene were present. Understanding how these strongly dominant negative mutant actins disrupt the function of wild-type actin would provide useful information about the molecular mechanism by which actin functions in vivo. Here, we expressed and purified six of these strongly dominant negative mutant actins in Dictyostelium and classified them into three groups based on their biochemical phenotypes. The first group, G156D, G156S, and G268D actins, showed impaired polymerization and a tendency to aggregate under conditions favoring polymerization. G63D actin of the second group was also unable to polymerize but, unlike those in the first group, remained soluble under polymerizing conditions. Kinetic analyses using G63D actin or G63D actin.gelsolin complexes suggested that the pointed end surface is defective, which would alter the polymerization kinetics of wild-type actin when mixed and could affect formation of thin filament structures in indirect flight muscle. The third group, R95C and E226K actins, was normal in terms of polymerization, but their motility on heavy meromyosin surfaces in the presence of tropomyosin-troponin indicated altered sensitivity to Ca(2+). Cofilaments in which R95C or E226K actins were copolymerized with a 3-fold excess of wild-type actin also showed altered Ca(2+) sensitivity in the presence of tropomyosin-troponin.",

        "abstract": "Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) depletion has been implicated in the therapeutic action of bipolar disorder drugs, including valproic acid (VPA). It is not currently known whether the effect of VPA on InsP3 depletion is related to the deleterious effects of teratogenicity or elevated viral replication, or if it occurs via putative inhibitory effects on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). In addition, the structural requirements of VPA-related compounds to cause InsP3 depletion are unknown. In the current study, we selected a set of 10 VPA congeners to examine their effects on InsP3 depletion, in vivo teratogenic potency, HIV replication, and GSK-3beta activity in vitro. We found four compounds that function to deplete InsP3 in the model eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, and these drugs all cause growth-cone enlargement in mammalian primary neurons, consistent with the effect of InsP3 depletion. No relationship was found between InsP3 depletion and teratogenic or elevated viral replication effects, and none of the VPA congeners were found to affect GSK-3beta activity. Structural requirements of VPA congers to maintain InsP3 depletion efficacy greater than that of lithium are a carboxylic-acid function without dependence on side-chain length, branching, or saturation. Noteworthy is the enantiomeric differentiation if a chiral center exists, suggesting that InsP3 depletion is mediated by a stereoselective mode of action. Thus, the effect of InsP3 depletion can be separated from that of teratogenic potency and elevated viral replication effect. We have used this to identify two VPA derivatives that share the common InsP3-depleting action of VPA, lithium and carbamazepine, but do not show the side effects of VPA, thus providing promising novel candidates for bipolar disorder treatment.",

In this study, we employed the proteome technology to analyze the SlyA regulons of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. In both cases, comparative analysis of the two-dimensional protein maps of a wild-type strain, a SlyA-overproducing derivative, and a corresponding slyA mutant revealed numerous proteins whose expression appeared to be either positively or negatively controlled by SlyA. Twenty of the putative SlyA-induced proteins and 13 of the putative SlyA-repressed proteins of the tested EIEC strain were identified by mass spectrometry. The former proteins included several molecular chaperones (GroEL, GroES, DnaK, GrpE, and CbpA), proteins involved in acid resistance (HdeA, HdeB, and GadA), the \"starvation lipoprotein\" (Slp), cytolysin ClyA (HlyE or SheA), and several enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, whereas most of the latter proteins proved to be biosynthetic enzymes. Consistently, the resistance of the EIEC slyA mutant to heat and acid stress was impaired compared to that of the wild-type strain. Furthermore, the implication of SlyA in the regulation of several of the identified E. coli proteins was confirmed at the level of transcription with lacZ fusions. Twenty-three of the Salmonella serovar Typhimurium proteins found to be affected by SlyA were also identified by mass spectrometry. With the exception of GroEL these differed from those identified in the EIEC strain and included proteins involved in various processes. The data suggest that gene regulation by SlyA might be crucial for intracellular survival and/or replication of both EIEC and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium in phagocytic host cells.",

        "abstract": "Expression of the bone sialoprotein (BSP) gene, a marker of bone formation, is largely restricted to cells in mineralized tissues. Recent studies have shown that the Cbfa1 (also known as Runx2, AML-3, and PEBP2alphaA) transcription factor supports commitment and differentiation of progenitor cells to hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts. This study addresses the functional involvement of Cbfa sites in expression of the Gallus BSP gene. Gel mobility shift analyses with nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells revealed that multiple Cbfa consensus sequences are functional Cbfa DNA binding sites. Responsiveness of the 1.2-kb Gallus BSP promoter to Cbfa factors Cbfa1, Cbfa2, and Cbfa3 was assayed in osseous and nonosseous cells. Each of the Cbfa factors mediated repression of the wild-type BSP promoter, in contrast to their well known activation of various hematopoietic and skeletal phenotypic genes. Suppression of BSP by Cbfa factors was not observed in BSP promoters in which Cbfa sites were deleted or mutated. Expression of the endogenous BSP gene in Gallus osteoblasts was similarly downregulated by forced expression of Cbfa factors. Our data indicate that Cbfa repression of the BSP promoter does not involve the transducin-like enhancer (TLE) proteins. Neither coexpression of TLE1 or TLE2 nor the absence of the TLE interaction motif of Cbfa1 (amino acids 501 to 513) influenced repressor activity. However, removal of the C terminus of Cbfa1 (amino acids 362 to 513) relieved suppression of the BSP promoter. Our results, together with the evolutionary conservation of the seven Cbfa sites in the Gallus and human BSP promoters, suggest that suppressor activity by Cbfa is of significant physiologic consequence and may contribute to spatiotemporal expression of BSP during bone development.",

        "title": "Early Vertebrate Evolution of the Host Restriction Factor Tetherin.",
        "abstract": "Tetherin is an interferon-inducible restriction factor targeting a broad range of enveloped viruses. Its antiviral activity depends on an unusual topology comprising an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) followed by an extracellular coiled-coil region and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. One of the two membrane anchors is inserted into assembling virions, while the other remains in the plasma membrane of the infected cell. Thus, tetherin entraps budding viruses by physically bridging viral and cellular membranes. Although tetherin restricts the release of a large variety of diverse human and animal viruses, only mammalian orthologs have been described to date. Here, we examined the evolutionary origin of this protein and demonstrate that tetherin orthologs are also found in fish, reptiles, and birds. Notably, alligator tetherin efficiently blocks the release of retroviral particles. Thus, tetherin emerged early during vertebrate evolution and acquired its antiviral activity before the mammal/reptile divergence. Although there is only limited sequence homology, all orthologs share the typical topology. Two unrelated proteins of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum also adopt a tetherin-like configuration with an N-terminal TMD and a C-terminal GPI anchor. However, these proteins showed no evidence for convergent evolution and failed to inhibit virion release. In summary, our findings demonstrate that tetherin emerged at least 450 million years ago and is more widespread than previously anticipated. The early evolution of antiviral activity together with the high topology conservation but low sequence homology suggests that restriction of virus release is the primary function of tetherin.",

We sought to elucidate the role of novel <i>D. discoideum</i> GTPase RabS. Cell lines over-expressing DdRabS and expressing DdRabS N137I (dominant negative (DN)) proteins were generated, and it was determined that DdRabS localized to endosomes, ER-Golgi membranes, and the contractile vacuole system. It appeared to function in vesicular trafficking, and the secretion of lysosomal enzymes. Interestingly, microscopic analysis of GFP-tagged DdRabS (DN) cells showed differential localization to lysosomes and endosomes compared to GFP-tagged DdRabS overexpressing cells. Both cell lines over-secreted lysosomal glycosidase enzymes, especially \u03b2-glucosidase. Furthermore, DdRabS overexpressing cells were defective in aggregation due to decreased cell\u207bcell cohesion and sensitivity to cAMP, leading to abnormal chemotactic migration, the inability to complete development, and increased induced cell death. These data support a role for DdRabS in trafficking along the vesicular and biosynthetic pathways. We hypothesize that overexpression of DdRabS may interfere with GTP activation of related proteins essential for normal development resulting in a cascade of defects throughout these processes.",

DIF-1 and 3 have also been reported to have tumor inhibiting properties; however, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of these compounds remain poorly defined. Herein, we show that DIF-3 rapidly triggers Ca2+ release and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the absence of cytochrome c and Smac release and without caspase activation. Consistently with these findings, we also detected no evidence of apoptosis in cells treated with DIF-3 but instead found that this compound induced autophagy. In addition, DIF-3 promoted mitochondrial fission in K562 and HeLa cells, as assessed by electron and confocal microscopy analysis. Importantly, DIF-3 mediated the phosphorylation and redistribution of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) from the cytoplasmic to the microsomal fraction of K562 cells. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA silencing of DRP1 not only inhibited mitochondrial fission but also protected K562 cells from DIF-3-mediated cell death. Furthermore, DIF-3 potently inhibited the growth of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant K562 cells. It also inhibited tumor formation in athymic mice engrafted with an imatinib-resistant CML cell line. Finally, DIF-3 exhibited a clear selectivity toward CD34+ leukemic cells from CML patients, compared with CD34- cells. In conclusion, we show that the potent anti-leukemic effect of DIF-3 is mediated through the induction of mitochondrial fission and caspase-independent cell death. Our findings may have important therapeutic implications, especially in the treatment of tumors that exhibit defects in apoptosis regulation.",

        "abstract": "Hem1 (Hematopoietic protein 1) is a hematopoietic cell-specific member of the Hem family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. Orthologues of Hem1 in Dictyostelium discoideum, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans are essential for cytoskeletal reorganization, embryonic cell migration, and morphogenesis. However, the in vivo functions of mammalian Hem1 are not known. Using a chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify novel genes involved in immune cell functions, we positionally cloned a nonsense mutation in the Hem1 gene. Hem1 deficiency results in defective F-actin polymerization and actin capping in lymphocytes and neutrophils caused by loss of the Rac-controlled actin-regulatory WAVE protein complex. T cell development is disrupted in Hem1-deficient mice at the CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) to CD4(+)CD8(+) (double positive) cell stages, whereas T cell activation and adhesion are impaired. Hem1-deficient neutrophils fail to migrate in response to chemotactic agents and are deficient in their ability to phagocytose bacteria. Remarkably, some Rac-dependent functions, such as Th1 differentiation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally in Hem1-deficient mice, whereas the production of Th17 cells are enhanced. These results demonstrate that Hem1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development, function, and homeostasis by controlling a distinct pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas NF-kappaB-dependent transcription proceeds independently of Hem1 and F-actin polymerization.",

Renal expression of the PRKX gene is developmentally regulated and restricted to the ureteric bud epithelium of the fetal metanephric kidney. Aberrant adult kidney expression of PRKX was found in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. PRKX kinase expression markedly activated migration of cultured renal epithelial cells in the presence of cAMP; this effect was blocked by cell treatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 and was not observed in PKA-transfected cells. In addition, expression of PRKX kinase activated branching morphogenesis of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in collagen gels even in the absence of cAMP and/or hepatocyte growth factor, an effect not seen with either PKA expression or expression of a mutant, kinase-inactivated PRKX. These results suggest that the PRKX kinase may regulate epithelial morphogenesis during mammalian kidney development. Because another member of the PRKX gene family (the Dictyostelium discoideum gene KAPC-DICDI) also plays a role in cellular migration, these studies suggest that regulation of morphogenesis may be a distinctive property of these genes that has been conserved in evolution that is not shared with PKA family genes.",

Using an in vitro motility assay, we show that Unc104 uses a lipid binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to dock onto membrane cargo. Through its PH domain, Unc104 can transport phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-containing liposomes with similar properties to native vesicles. Interestingly, liposome movement by monomeric Unc104 motors shows a very steep dependence on PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration (Hill coefficient of approximately 20), even though liposome binding is noncooperative. This switch-like transition for movement can be shifted to lower PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentrations by the addition of cholesterol/sphingomyelin or GM1 ganglioside/cholera toxin, conditions that produce raft-like behavior of Unc104 bound to lipid bilayers. These studies suggest that clustering of Unc104 in PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing rafts provides a trigger for membrane transport.",

The modA gene was previously linked to in vivo competitiveness of P. aeruginosa by a genetic screening in the rat lung. This gene encodes a subunit of transporter ModABC, which is responsible for extracellular uptake of molybdate. This compound is essential for molybdoenzymes, including nitrate reductases. Since anaerobic growth conditions are known to occur during CF chronic lung infection, inactivation of a molybdate transporter could inhibit proliferation through the inactivation of denitrification enzymes.

        "abstract": "The small molecule EMD 57033 has been shown to stimulate the actomyosin ATPase activity and contractility of myofilaments. Here, we show that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. EMD 57033-binding protects myosin against heat stress and thermal denaturation. In the presence of EMD 57033, ATP hydrolysis, coupling between actin and nucleotide binding sites, and actin affinity in the presence of ATP are increased more than 10-fold. Addition of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated \u03b2-cardiac myosin is followed by refolding and reactivation of ATPase and motile activities. In heat-stressed cardiomyocytes expression of the stress-marker atrial natriuretic peptide is suppressed by EMD 57033. Thus, EMD 57033 displays a much wider spectrum of activities than those previously associated with small, drug-like compounds. Allosteric effectors that mediate refolding and enhance enzymatic function have the potential to improve the treatment of heart failure, myopathies, and protein misfolding diseases.

        "abstract": "Cell differentiation is traditionally monitored with a few marker genes, which may bias results. To understand the evolution and regulation of the spore, stalk, cup and basal disc cells in Dictyostelia, we previously performed RNAseq on purified cell-types of taxon-group representative dictyostelids. Using promoter-<i>lacZ</i> constructs in <i>D. discoideum</i>, we here investigate the spatio-temporal expression pattern of 29 cell-type specific genes. Genes selected for spore- or cup-specificity in RNAseq were validated as such by <i>lacZ</i> expression, but genes selected for stalk-specificity showed variable additional expression in basal disc, early cup or prestalk populations. We measured responses of 25 genes to 15 single or combined regimes of induction by stimuli known to regulate cell differentiation. The outcomes of these experiments were subjected to hierarchical clustering to identify whether common modes of regulation were correlated with specific expression patterns. The analysis identified a cluster combining the spore and cup genes, which shared upregulation by 8-bromo cyclic AMP and down-regulation by Differentiation Inducing Factor 1 (DIF-1). Most stalk-expressed genes combined into a single cluster and shared strong upregulation by cyclic di-guanylate (c-di-GMP), and synergistic upregulation by combined DIF-1 and c-di-GMP. There was no clustering of genes expressed in other soma besides the stalk, but two genes that were only expressed in the stalk did not respond to any stimuli. In contrast to current models, the study indicates the existence of a stem-cell like soma population in slugs, whose members only acquire ultimate cell fate after progressing to their terminal location during fruiting body morphogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Indirect somatic genetic rescue (SGR) of a germline mutation is thought to be rare in inherited Mendelian disorders. Here, we establish that acquired mutations in the EIF6 gene are a frequent mechanism of SGR in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a leukemia predisposition disorder caused by a germline defect in ribosome assembly. Biallelic mutations in the SBDS or EFL1 genes in SDS impair release of the anti-association factor eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit, a key step in the translational activation of ribosomes. Here, we identify diverse mosaic somatic genetic events (point mutations, interstitial deletion, reciprocal chromosomal translocation) in SDS hematopoietic cells that reduce eIF6 expression or disrupt its interaction with the 60S subunit, thereby conferring a selective advantage over non-modified cells. SDS-related somatic EIF6 missense mutations that reduce eIF6 dosage or eIF6 binding to the 60S subunit suppress the defects in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis across multiple SBDS-deficient species including yeast, Dictyostelium and Drosophila. Our data suggest that SGR is a universal phenomenon that may influence the clinical evolution of diverse Mendelian disorders and support eIF6 suppressor mimics as a therapeutic strategy in SDS.",

        "abstract": "Resistance to phagocyte killing is an important virulence factor in mycobacteria. Dictyostelium has been used to study the interaction between phagocytes and bacteria, given its similarity to the mammalian macrophage. Here, we investigated the genes responsible for virulence to Dictyostelium by screening 1728 transposon mutants of the Mycobacterium marinum NTUH-M6094 strain. A total of 30 mutants that permissive for Dictyostelium growth were identified. These mutants revealed interruptions in 20 distinct loci. Of the 20 loci, six genes (losA, mmar_2318, mmar_2319, wecE, mmar_2323 and mmar_2353) were located in the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) synthesis cluster. LOS are antigenic glycolipids and the core LOS structure from LOS-I to LOS-IV have been reported to exist in M. marinum. Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) glycolipid profiles revealed that deletion of mmar_2318 or mmar_2319 resulted in the accumulation of LOS-III and deficiency of LOS-IV. Deletion and complementation of mmar_2318 or mmar_2319 confirmed that these genes both contributed to virulence toward Dictyostelium but not entry and replication inside Dictyostelium. Co-incubation with a murine macrophage cell line J774a.1 or PMA-induced human monocytic cell line THP-1 demonstrated that mmar_2318 or mmar_2319 deletion mutant could grow in macrophages, and their initial entry rate was not affected in J774a.1 but significantly increased in THP-1. In conclusion, although mmar_2319 has been reported to involve LOS biosynthesis in a previous study, we identified a new gene, mmar_2318 that is also involved in the biosynthesis of LOS. Deletion of mmar_2318 or mmar_2319 both exhibits reduction of virulence toward Dictyostelium and increased entry into THP-1 cells.",

In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge about the cell-substratum adhesion in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, present an inventory of the involved proteins, and draw parallels with the situation in animal cells. The emerging picture indicates that, while retaining the basic molecular architecture common to their animal relatives, the adhesion complexes in free-living amoeboid cells have evolved to enable less specific interactions with diverse materials encountered in their natural habitat in the deciduous forest soil. Dissection of molecular mechanisms that underlay short lifetime of the cell-substratum attachments and high turnover rate of the adhesion complexes in <i>Dictyostelium</i> should provide insight into a similarly modified adhesion phenotype that accompanies the mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in tumor metastasis.",

Independently from reduced uptake, L. pneumophila proliferates more efficiently in PI3K-null than in wild-type cells. PI3K inactivation also neutralizes resistance to infection conferred by constitutively expressing the endo-lysosomal iron transporter Nramp1. We have shown this to be due to altered recruitment of the V-H(+) ATPase, but not Nramp1, in the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) early during infection.1 As further evidence for impaired LCV acidification we examine here the effects of disrupting the small G protein RacH on Legionella infection.",

        "abstract": "Polarity, which refers to the molecular or structural asymmetry in cells, is essential for diverse cellular functions. <i>Dictyostelium</i> has proven to be a valuable system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cell polarity. Previous studies in <i>Dictyostelium</i> have revealed a range of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins that function at the leading edge to promote pseudopod extension and migration. In contrast, how proteins are localized to the trailing edge is not well understood. By screening for asymmetrically localized proteins, we identified a novel trailing-edge protein we named Teep1. We show that a charged surface formed by two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains in Teep1 is necessary and sufficient for targeting it to the rear of cells. Combining biochemical and imaging analyses, we demonstrate that Teep1 interacts preferentially with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> <i>in vitro</i> and simultaneous elimination of these lipid species in cells blocks the membrane association of Teep1. Furthermore, a leading-edge localized myotubularin phosphatase likely mediates the removal of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> from the front, as well as the formation of a back-to-front gradient of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.

Both endogenous Src1 and GFP-Src1 are localized to the NE during the entire cell cycle. Immuno-electron microscopy and light microscopy after differential detergent treatment indicated that Src1 resides in the INM. FRAP experiments with GFP-Src1 cells suggested that at least a fraction of the protein could be stably engaged in forming the nuclear lamina together with the Dictyostelium lamin NE81. Both a BioID proximity assay and mis-localization of soluble, truncated mRFP-Src1 at cytosolic clusters consisting of an intentionally mis-localized mutant of GFP-NE81 confirmed an interaction of Src1 and NE81. Expression GFP-Src1(1-646), a fragment C-terminally truncated after the first transmembrane domain, disrupted interaction of nuclear membranes with the nuclear lamina, as cells formed protrusions of the NE that were dependent on cytoskeletal pulling forces.

One of them is the conserved CDK5RAP2 protein. Here we focus on the role of <i>Dictyostelium</i> CDK5RAP2 for maintenance of centrosome integrity, its interaction partners and its dynamic behavior during interphase and mitosis. GFP-CDK5RAP2 is present at the centrosome during the entire cell cycle except from a short period during prophase, correlating with the normal dissociation of the corona at this stage. RNAi depletion of CDK5RAP2 results in complete disorganization of centrosomes and microtubules suggesting that CDK5RAP2 is required for organization of the corona and its association to the core structure. This is in line with the observation that overexpressed GFP-CDK5RAP2 elicited supernumerary cytosolic MTOCs. The phenotype of CDK5RAP2 depletion was very reminiscent of that observed upon depletion of CP148, another scaffolding protein of the corona. BioID interaction assays revealed an interaction of CDK5RAP2 not only with the corona markers CP148, &gamma;-tubulin, and CP248, but also with the core components Cep192, CP75, and CP91. Furthermore, protein localization studies in both depletion strains revealed that CP148 and CDK5RAP2 cooperate in corona organization.",

        "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are self-reproducing organelles with their own DNA and they play a central role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by respiration. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondria also have critical and multiple functions in the initiation of cell differentiation, cell-type determination, cell movement, and pattern formation. This has been most strikingly realized in development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium. For example, the expression of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (mt-rps4) gene is required for the initial differentiation. The Dictyostelium homologue (Dd-TRAP1) of TRAP-1 (tumor necrosis receptor-associated protein 1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp90 family, allows the prompt transition of cells from growth to differentiation through a novel prestarvation factor (PSF-3) in growth medium. Moreover, a cell-type-specific organelle named a prespore-specific vacuole (PSV) is constructed by mitochondrial transformation with the help of the Golgi complex. Mitochondria are also closely involved in a variety of cellular activities including CN-resistant respiration and apoptosis. These mitochondrial functions are reviewed in this article, with special emphasis on the regulation of Dictyostelium development.",

We identified <i>pikfyve</i> as the defective gene in a <i>Dictyostelium</i> mutant that failed to form spores.

This response is independent of hetero-trimeric G-proteins, the putative IP3 receptor IplA and all P2X channels. We show, unexpectedly, that it is abolished in mutants of the polycystin-type transient receptor potential channel, TrpP. Responses to the chemoattractants cyclic-AMP and folic acid are unaffected in TrpP mutants. We report that the DIF morphogens, cyclic-di-GMP, GABA, glutamate and adenosine all induce strong cytoplasmic calcium responses, likewise independently of TrpP. Thus, TrpP is dedicated to purinergic signalling. ATP treatment causes cell blebbing within seconds but this does not require TrpP, implicating a separate purinergic receptor. We could detect no effect of ATP on chemotaxis and TrpP mutants grow, chemotax and develop almost normally in standard conditions. No gating ligand is known for the human homologue of TrpP, polycystin-2, which causes polycystic kidney disease.

Recently, RapC has been reported to be involved in cytokinesis, cell migration, and multicellular development. Here, we compare the functions of RapA and RapC using cells expressing or lacking Rap proteins, and confirm that RapA and RapC have opposite functions in cell spreading, adhesion, and migration. On the other hand, RapC has a unique function in cytokinesis and multicellular development. Activated RapA appears to stimulate spreading and adhesion of the cells to the substrate, possibly resulting in a decrease in the migration speed of the cells during chemotaxis without affecting the directionality, whereas RapC suppresses cell spreading and adhesion, thereby increasing the migration speed. Cells lacking RapC were defective in cytokinesis and multicellular development and showed multinucleation and formation of multiple tips from a mound during development. At the C-terminus, RapC has an additional stretch of amino acids, which is not found in RapA. The mechanism through which RapA and RapC perform their opposite functions in diverse cellular processes should be characterized further to understand the Rap signaling pathways in detail. <b>ABBREVIATIONS:</b> GAP; GTPase-activating proteins; GEF; guanine nucleotide exchanging factor; WT; wild type; CA; constitutively active; DN; dominantly negative.",

We found that this GTP/GDP cycle for DdRab2 is crucial for normal Dictyostelium development and cell-cell adhesion. Similar to Rab5 and Rab7 in C. elegans, we found that DdRab2 plays a role in programmed cell death, possibly in the phagocytic removal of apoptotic corpses.",

        "abstract": "Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles in the development of eukaryotic organisms through the regulation of signal transduction pathways stimulated by external signals. MAPK signaling pathways have been associated with the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and chemotaxis, indicating MAPKs contribute to a diverse set of developmental processes. In most eukaryotes, the diversity of external signals is likely to far exceed the diversity of MAPKs, suggesting that multiple signaling pathways might share MAPKs. Do different signaling pathways converge before MAPK function or can MAPKs maintain signaling specificity through interactions with specific proteins? The genetic and biochemical analysis of MAPK pathways in simple eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium offers opportunities to investigate functional specificity of MAPKs in G protein-mediated signal transduction pathways. This review considers the regulation and specificity of MAPK function in pathways that control Dictyostelium growth and development.",

        "abstract": "In aerobic organisms, oxygen is essential for efficient energy production, and it acts as the last acceptor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and as regulator of gene expression. However, excessive oxygen can lead to production of deleterious reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the directed migration of single cells or cell clumps from hypoxic areas toward a region of optimal oxygen concentration, named aerotaxis, can be considered an adaptive mechanism that plays a major role in biological and pathological processes. One relevant example is the development of O<sub>2</sub> gradients when tumors grow beyond their vascular supply, leading frequently to metastasis. In higher eukaryotic organisms, aerotaxis has only recently begun to be explored, but genetically amenable model organisms suitable to dissect this process remain an unmet need. In this regard, we sought to assess whether <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells, which are an established model for chemotaxis and other motility processes, could sense oxygen gradients and move directionally in their response. By assessing different physical parameters, our findings indicate that both growing and starving <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells under hypoxic conditions migrate directionally toward regions of higher O<sub>2</sub> concentration. This migration is characterized by a specific pattern of cell arrangement. A thickened circular front of high cell density (<i>corona</i>) forms in the cell cluster and persistently moves following the oxygen gradient. Cells in the colony center, where hypoxia is more severe, are less motile and display a rounded shape. Aggregation-competent cells forming streams by chemotaxis, when confined under hypoxic conditions, undergo stream or aggregate fragmentation, giving rise to multiple small loose aggregates that coordinately move toward regions of higher O<sub>2</sub> concentration. By testing a panel of mutants defective in chemotactic signaling, and a catalase-deficient strain, we found that the latter and the pkbR1 <sup><i>null</i></sup> exhibited altered migration patterns. Our results suggest that in Dictyostelium, like in mammalian cells, an intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide favors the migration toward optimal oxygen concentration. Furthermore, differently from chemotaxis, this oxygen-driven migration is a G protein-independent process.",

        "abstract": "Over time we have come to appreciate that the complex regulation of Rho GTPases involves additional mechanisms beyond the activating role of RhoGEFs, the inactivating function of RhoGAPs and the sequestering activity of RhoGDIs. One class of regulatory mechanisms includes direct modifications of Rho proteins such as isoprenylation, phosphorylation and SUMOylation. Rho GTPases can also regulate each other by means of crosstalk signaling, which is again mostly mediated by GEFs, GAPs and GDIs. More complex mutual regulation ensues when and where two or more Rho proteins activate a common molecular target, i.e., share a common effector. We have recently unraveled a reciprocal mechanism wherein spatiotemporal dynamics of Rac1 activity during migration of Dictyostelium cells is apparently regulated by antagonizing interactions of Rac1-GTP with two distinct effectors. By monitoring specific fluorescent probes, activated Rac1 is simultaneously present at the leading edge, where it participates in Scar/WAVE-mediated actin polymerization, and at the trailing edge, where it induces formation of a DGAP1/cortexillin actin-bundling complex. Strikingly, in addition to their opposed localization, the two populations of activated Rac1 also display opposite kinetics of recruitment to the plasma membrane upon stimulation by chemoattractants. These findings with respect to Rac1 in Dictyostelium suggest a novel principle for regulation of Rho GTPase activity that might also play a role in other cell types and for other Rho family members.",

Profilin, Arp/2/3 and WASH identified by mass spectrometry were found to colocalise with model Hirano bodies. Due to their roles in actin regulation, we selected these proteins for further investigation. Inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex by CK666 prevented formation of model Hirano bodies. Since Arp2/3 activation occurs via the WASH or WAVE complex, we next investigated how these proteins affect Hirano body formation. Whereas model Hirano bodies could form in WASH-deficient cells, they failed to form in cells lacking HSPC300, a member of the WAVE complex. We identified other proteins required for Hirano body formation that include profilin and VASP, an actin nucleation factor. In the case of VASP, both its G- and F-actin binding domains were required for model Hirano body formation. Collectively, our results indicate that de novo actin polymerization is required to form model Hirano bodies.",

Here, we demonstrate that <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells move directionally in response to an electric field (EF) with specific acceleration/deceleration kinetics of directionality and migration speed. Detailed analyses of the migration kinetics suggest that migration speed and directionality are separately regulated by G\u03b2 and RasG, respectively, in EF-directed cell migration. Cells lacking G\u03b2, which is essential for all chemotactic responses in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, showed EF-directed cell migration with the same increase in directionality in an EF as wild-type cells. However, these cells failed to show induction of the migration speed upon EF stimulation as much as wild-type cells. Loss of RasG, a key regulator of chemoattractant-directed cell migration, resulted in almost complete loss of directionality, but similar acceleration/deceleration kinetics of migration speed as wild-type cells. These results indicate that G\u03b2 and RasG are required for the induction of migration speed and directionality, respectively, in response to an EF, suggesting separation of migration speed and directionality even with intact feedback loops between mechanical and signaling networks.",

The concentrations of several intracellular proteins rise rapidly reaching their maximum levels approximately 5-10 seconds, after which they return to prestimulus levels. This response, which is found in many other chemotaxing cells, is an example of a step disturbance rejection, a process known to biologists as perfect adaptation. Unlike other cells, however, the initial first peak observed in the chemoattractant-induced response of Dictyostelium cells is then followed by a slower, smaller phase peaking approximately one to two minutes after the stimulus. Until recently, the nature of this biphasic response has been poorly understood. Moreover, the origin for the second phase is unknown. In this paper we conjecture the existence of a feedback path between the response and stimulus. Using a mathematical model of the chemoattractant-induced response in cells, and standard tools from control engineering, we show that positive feedback may elicit this second peak.",

        "abstract": "Sirtuin interacts with many regulatory proteins involved in energy homeostasis, DNA repair, cell survival, and lifespan extension. We investigated the functional roles of Sir2D during early <i>Dictyostelium</i> development upon starvation. We found that ectopic expression of Sir2D accelerated development among three Sirtuins containing highly homologous catalytic domain sequences to mouse Sirt1. Sir2D expression upregulated adenylate cyclase A (aca) mRNA expression 2, 4 and 6 h after starvation. We have previously reported that nicotinamide, a Sirt1 inhibitor, treatment delayed the development and decreased the expression of aca at 4 h after starvation. Sir2D expressing cells showed resistance against the nicotinamide effect. RNAi-mediated Sir2D knockdown cells were generated, and their development was also delayed. Aca expression was decreased 4 h after starvation. Sir2D expression restored the developmental impairment of Sir2D knockdown cells. The induction of aca upon starvation starts with transcriptional activation of MybB. The ectopic expression of MybB accelerated the development and increased the expression of aca 2 and 4 h after starvation but did not restore the phenotype of Sir2D knockdown cells. Sir2D expression had no effects on MybB-null mutant cells during early development. Thus, MybB is necessary for the upregulation of aca by Sir2D, and Sir2D is necessary for the full induction of aca after 4 h by MybB. MybB was coimmunoprecipitated with Sir2D, suggesting an interaction between MybB and Sir2D. These results suggest that Sir2D regulates aca expression through interaction with the MybB transcription factor early in <i>Dictyostelium</i> development upon starvation.",

The Rho-Ras hetero-oligomers directly and specifically stimulate mTORC2 activity toward AKT in cells and after biochemical reconstitution using purified proteins in\u00a0vitro. The Rho-Ras hetero-oligomers do not activate ERK/MAPK, another kinase that functions downstream of GPCRs and Ras. Human KRas4B functionally replace Dictyostelium Ras in mTORC2 activation. In contrast to GDP-Rho, GTP-Rho antagonizes mTORC2-AKT signaling by inhibiting the oligomerization of GDP-Rho with GTP-Ras. These data reveal that GPCR-stimulated hetero-oligomerization of Rho and Ras provides a critical regulatory step that controls mTORC2-AKT signaling.",

In fact, there are several deduced sites phosphorylated by PKC in ZYG1 protein. Thereupon, we designed the present work to examine whether or not ZYG1 is actually phosphorylated by PKC and localized at the regions of cell-cell contacts where cell fusion occurs. These were ascertained, suggesting that ZYG1 might be the target protein for PKC. A humanized version of zyg1 cDNA (mzyg1) was introduced into myoblasts to know if ZYG1 is also effective in cell fusion of myoblasts. Quite interestingly, enforced expression of ZYG1 in myoblasts was found to induce markedly their cell fusion, thus strongly suggesting the existence of a common signaling pathway for cell fusion beyond the difference of species.",

The diet was assumed to be functioning through the effect of reduced carbohydrate intake regulating cellular energy state, thus giving rise to seizure control. From this assumption, the generation of ketones during starvation provided an attractive mechanism for this altered energy state; however, many years of research has sought and largely failed to correlate seizure control and ketone levels. Due to this focus on ketones, few studies have examined a role for free fatty acids, as metabolic intermediates between the triglycerides provided in the diet and ketones, in seizure control. Recent discoveries have now suggested that the medium-chain fats, delivered through the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet, may provide a key therapeutic mechanism of the diet in seizure control. Here we describe an unusual pathway leading to this discovery, beginning with the use of a tractable non-animal model-<i>Dictyostelium</i>, through to the demonstration that medium-chain fats play a direct role in seizure control, and finally the identification of a mechanism of action of these fats and related congeners leading to reduced neural excitability and seizure control.",

To govern the interactions with host cells, L. pneumophila employs the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system and more than 250 translocated \"effector proteins\" that presumably subvert host signaling and vesicle trafficking pathways. Some of the effector proteins anchor through distinct PIs to the cytosolic face of LCVs and promote the interaction with host vesicles and organelles, catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange of small GTPases, or bind to PI-metabolizing enzymes, such as OCRL1. The PI 5-phosphatase OCRL1 and its Dictyostelium homologue Dd5P4 restrict intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Moreover, OCRL1/Dd5P4, PI 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and PI4KIII\u03b2 regulate LCV formation and localization of the effector protein SidC, which selectively decorates the LCV membrane. SidC and its 20-kDa \"P4C\" fragment are robust and specific probes for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, and SidC can be targeted to purify intact LCVs by immuno-magnetic separation. Taken together, bacterial PI-binding effectors as well as host PIs and PI-modulating enzymes play a pivotal role for intracellular replication of L. pneumophila, and the PI-binding effectors are valuable tools for the analysis of eukaryotic PI lipids.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms of drug action has been the primary focus for pharmacological researchers, traditionally using rodent models. However, non-sentient model systems are now increasingly being used as an alternative approach to better understand drug action or targets. One of these model systems, the social amoeba Dictyostelium, enables the rapid ablation or over-expression of genes, and the subsequent use of isogenic cell culture for the analysis of cell signalling pathways in pharmacological research. The model also supports an increasingly important ethical view of research, involving the reduction, replacement and refinement of animals in biomedical research. This review outlines the use of Dictyostelium in understanding the pharmacological action of two commonly used bipolar disorder treatments (valproic acid and lithium). Both of these compounds regulate mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and inositol phospholipid-based signalling by unknown means. Analysis of the molecular pathways targeted by these drugs in Dictyostelium and translation of discoveries to animal systems has helped to further understand the molecular mechanisms of these bipolar disorder treatments.",

There are two models for membrane supply to support cell division: (1) unfolding of small surface membrane reservoirs such as microvilli or wrinkles and (2) exocytosis of intracellular vesicles. Here, we precisely measured the total cell surface area in dividing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells, flattened by the agar overlay that eliminated the complexity of unfolding surface membrane reservoirs. Because the cells divided normally under the agar overlay, unfolding of surface membrane reservoirs was not required for cell division. Under the agar overlay, the total cell surface area slightly decreased from the interphase to the metaphase and then increased about 20% during cytokinesis. Both endocytosis and exocytosis were suppressed in the early mitotic phase but recovered during cytokinesis. The imbalance of endocytosis and exocytosis could contribute to the changes observed in the cell surface area. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis was also substantially suppressed during cytokinesis, but contrary to previous reports in cultured animal cells, it did not significantly contribute to the regulation of the cell surface area. Furrowing during cytokinesis was indispensable for the cell membrane increase, and vice versa.",

        "abstract": "Like most eukaryotes, the pre-metazoan social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i> depends on the SCF (Skp1/cullin-1/F-box protein) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases to regulate its proteome. In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, starvation induces a transition from unicellular feeding to a multicellular slug that responds to external signals to culminate into a fruiting body containing terminally differentiated stalk and spore cells. These transitions are subject to regulation by F-box proteins and O<sub>2</sub>-dependent posttranslational modifications of Skp1. Here we examine in greater depth the essential role of FbxwD and Vwa1, an intracellular vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin (VIT) and von Willebrand factor-A (vWFA) domain containing protein that was found in the FbxwD interactome by co-immunoprecipitation. Reciprocal co-IPs using gene-tagged strains confirmed the interaction and similar changes in protein levels during multicellular development suggested co-functioning. FbxwD overexpression and proteasome inhibitors did not affect Vwa1 levels suggesting a non-substrate relationship. Forced FbxwD overexpression in slug tip cells where it is normally enriched interfered with terminal cell differentiation by a mechanism that depended on its F-box and RING domains, and on Vwa1 expression itself. Whereas <i>vwa1</i>-disruption alone did not affect development, overexpression of either of its three conserved domains arrested development but the effect depended on Vwa1 expression. Based on structure predictions, we propose that the Vwa1 domains exert their negative effect by artificially activating Vwa1 from an autoinhibited state, which in turn imbalances its synergistic function with FbxwD. Autoinhibition or homodimerization might be relevant to the poorly understood tumor suppressor role of the evolutionarily related VWA5A/BCSC-1 in humans.",

        "abstract": "Class-1 PI3-kinases are major regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, whose precise contributions to chemotaxis, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis remain unresolved. We used systematic genetic ablation to examine this question in growing Dictyostelium cells. Mass spectroscopy shows that a quintuple mutant lacking the entire genomic complement of class-1 PI3-kinases retains only 10% of wild-type PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels. Chemotaxis to folate and phagocytosis of bacteria proceed normally in the quintuple mutant but macropinocytosis is abolished. In this context PI3-kinases show specialized functions, only one of which is directly linked to gross PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels: macropinosomes originate in patches of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, with associated F-actin-rich ruffles, both of which depend on PI3-kinase 1/2 (PI3K1/2) but not PI3K4, whereas conversion of ruffles into vesicles requires PI3K4. A biosensor derived from the Ras-binding domain of PI3K1 suggests that Ras is activated throughout vesicle formation. Binding assays show that RasG and RasS interact most strongly with PI3K1/2 and PI3K4, and single mutants of either Ras have severe macropinocytosis defects. Thus, the fundamental function of PI3-kinases in growing Dictyostelium cells is in macropinocytosis where they have two distinct functions, supported by at least two separate Ras proteins.",

Previous reports have shown that actin and myosin II accumulate around the wound and that the constriction of this purse-string closes the membrane pore. Here, we developed a microsurgical wound assay to assess wound repair in Dictyostelium cells. Fluorescent dye that had been incorporated into the cells leaked out for only 2-3\u2005sec after wounding, and a GFP-derived, fluorescent Ca(2+) sensor showed that intracellular Ca(2+) transiently increased immediately after wounding. In the absence of external Ca(2+), the cell failed to repair itself. During the repair process, actin accumulated at the wounded sites but myosin II did not. The wounds were repaired even in myosin II null cells to a comparable degree as the wild-type cells, suggesting that myosin II does not contribute to wound repair. Thus, the actomyosin purse-string constriction model is not a common mechanism for wound repair in eukaryotic cells, and this discrepancy may arise from the difference in cell size.",

Central to eukaryotic chemotaxis is the molecular mechanism by which chemoattractant-mediated activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) induces symmetry breaking in the activated downstream signaling pathways. Studies with mainly Dictyostelium and mammalian neutrophils as experimental systems have shown that chemotaxis is mediated by a complex network of signaling pathways. Recently, several labs have used extensive and efficient proteomic approaches to further unravel this dynamic signaling network. Together these studies showed the critical role of the interplay between heterotrimeric G-protein subunits and monomeric G proteins in regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements during chemotaxis. Here we highlight how these proteomic studies have provided greater insight into the mechanisms by which the heterotrimeric G protein cycle is regulated, how heterotrimeric G proteins-induced symmetry breaking is mediated through small G protein signaling, and how symmetry breaking in G protein signaling subsequently induces cytoskeleton rearrangements and cell migration.",

Standardizing image analysis was found to be highly challenging: the amount of human judgment required for parameter optimization, algorithm tweaking, training and data pre-processing steps forms serious challenges for reproducibility. To bring automation and help remove bias from live-cell image analysis, we developed a self-supervised learning (SSL) method that recursively trains itself directly from motion in live-cell microscopy images without any end-user input, thus providing objective cell segmentation. Here, we highlight this SSL method applied to characterizing the engineered <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells of the original IV&V program. This approach is highly generalizable, accepting images from any cell type or optical modality without the need for manual training or parameter optimization. This method represents an important step toward automated bioimage analysis software and reflects broader efforts to design accessible measurement technologies to enhance reproducibility in synthetic biology research.",

In this article, we review some of the recent progress made in understanding molecular mechanisms of cellular level adaptation. We take the minimalist (or the physicist) approach and study the simplest systems that exhibit generic adaptive behaviors. We focus on understanding the basic biochemical interaction networks in living matter that are responsible for adaptation dynamics. By combining theoretical modeling with quantitative experimentation, we demonstrate universal features in adaptation as well as important differences in different cellular systems, including chemotaxis in bacterium cells (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) and eukaryotic cells (<i>Dictyostelium</i>).

Protists belong to multiple taxonomic groups; they are widely distributed geographically and in all environments. Their ability to discriminate among con- and heterospecifics has been documented during the past decade. Here we discuss exemplar cases of taxa-, clone-, and possible kin-discrimination in five major lineages: Mycetozoa (<i>Dictyostelium</i>, <i>Polysphondylium</i>), Dikarya (<i>Saccharomyces</i>), Ciliophora (<i>Tetrahymena</i>), Apicomplexa (<i>Plasmodium</i>) and Archamoebae (<i>Entamoeba</i>). We summarize the proposed genetic mechanisms involved in discrimination-mediated aggregation (self versus different), including the <i>csA</i>, <i>FLO</i> and <i>trg</i> (formerly <i>lag</i>) genes, and the Proliferation Activation Factors (PAFs), which facilitate clustering in some protistan taxa. We caution about the experimental challenges intrinsic to studying recognition in protists, and highlight the opportunities for exploring the ecology and evolution of complex forms of cell-cell communication, including social behavior, in a polyphyletic, still superficially understood group of organisms. Because unicellular eukaryotes are the evolutionary precursors of multicellular life, we infer that their mechanisms of taxa-, clone-, and possible kin-discrimination gave origin to the complex diversification and sophistication of traits associated with species and kin recognition in plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates.",

Attractant gradients may be imposed by external sources, or self-generated, when cells create their own steep local gradients by breaking down a prevalent, broadly distributed attractant. Here we show that chemotaxis works far more robustly toward self-generated gradients. Cells can only respond efficiently to a restricted range of attractant concentrations; if attractants are too dilute, their gradients are too shallow for cells to sense, but if they are too high, all receptors become saturated and cells cannot perceive spatial differences. Self-generated gradients are robust because cells maintain the attractant at optimal concentrations. A wave can recruit varying numbers of steered cells, and cells can take time to break down attractant before starting to migrate. Self-generated gradients can therefore operate over a greater range of attractant concentrations, larger distances, and longer times than imposed gradients. The robustness is further enhanced at low cell numbers if attractants also act as mitogens, and at high attractant concentrations if the enzymes that break down attractants are themselves induced by constant attractant levels.",

However, the mechanisms of those spatially-defined interactions have not been fully elucidated. If the structures of actin filaments differ in different parts of a cell, as suggested by previous <i>in vitro</i> structural studies, ABPs may distinguish these structural differences and interact with specific actin filaments in the cell. To test this hypothesis, we followed the translocation of the actin binding domain of filamin (ABD<sub>FLN</sub>) fused with photoswitchable fluorescent protein (mKikGR) in polarized <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. When ABD<sub>FLN</sub>-mKikGR was photoswitched in the middle of a polarized cell, photoswitched ABD<sub>FLN</sub>-mKikGR rapidly translocated to the rear of the cell, even though actin filaments were abundant in the front. The speed of translocation (>3 \u03bcm/s) was much faster than that of the retrograde flow of cortical actin filaments. Rapid translocation of ABD<sub>FLN</sub>-mKikGR to the rear occurred normally in cells lacking GAPA, the only protein, other than actin, known to bind ABD<sub>FLN</sub>. We suggest that ABD<sub>FLN</sub> recognizes a certain feature of actin filaments in the rear of the cell and selectively binds to them, contributing to the posterior localization of filamin.",

These behaviours depend on excitable networks that enable amoebas to produce propagating waves of the chemoattractant cAMP, and to respond by directional movement. cAMP additionally regulates cell differentiation throughout development, with differentiation and cell movement being coordinated by interaction of the stalk inducer c-di-GMP with the adenylate cyclase that generates cAMP oscillations. Evolutionary studies indicate how the manifold roles of cAMP in multicellular development evolved from a role as intermediate for starvation-induced encystation in the unicellular ancestor.

OGT activity, which may compete with that of kinases, is involved in signaling in animals and plants, and abnormalities in OGT activities have been associated with type 2 diabetes. Here, we show that ogt genes that predict enzymes with characteristic tetratricopeptide repeats and a spindly domain are present in some protists (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and Dictyostelium) but are absent from the majority of protists examined (e.g., Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, Entamoeba, and Trichomonas). Similarly, ogt genes are present in some fungi but are absent from numerous other fungi, suggesting that secondary loss is an important contributor to the evolution of ogt genes. Nucleocytosolic extracts of Giardia and Cryptosporidium show OGT activity, and recombinant Giardia and Cryptosporidium OGTs are active in yeast and bacteria, respectively. These results suggest the possibility that O-GlcNAc modification of nucleocytosolic proteins also has function(s) in simple eukaryotes.",

Two classes of mechanisms are known to promote cooperation: 'partner choice', where a cooperator preferentially interacts with cooperative over cheating partners; and 'partner fidelity feedback', where repeated interactions between individuals ensure that cheaters suffer as their cooperative partners languish (see, for example, Momeni et al., 2013). However when both mechanisms can act, differentiating them has generated controversy. Here, I resolve this controversy by noting that selection can operate on organismal and sub-organismal 'entities' such that partner fidelity feedback at sub-organismal level can appear as partner choice at organismal level. I also show that cooperation between multicellular eukaryotes and mitochondria is promoted by partner fidelity feedback and partner choice between sub-organismal entities, in addition to being promoted by partner fidelity feedback between hosts and symbionts, as was previously known.",

        "abstract": "Amoeboid cell movement and migration are wide-spread across various cell types and species. Microscopy-based analysis of the model systems <i>Dictyostelium</i> and neutrophils over the years have uncovered generality in their overall cell movement pattern. Under no directional cues, the centroid movement can be quantitatively characterized by their persistence to move in a straight line and the frequency of re-orientation. Mathematically, the cells essentially behave as a persistent random walker with memory of two characteristic time-scale. Such quantitative characterization is important from a cellular-level ethology point of view as it has direct connotation to their exploratory and foraging strategies. Interestingly, outside the amoebozoa and metazoa, there are largely uncharacterized species in the excavate taxon Heterolobosea including amoeboflagellate <i>Naegleria</i>. While classical works have shown that these cells indeed show typical amoeboid locomotion on an attached surface, their quantitative features are so far unexplored. Here, we analyzed the cell movement of <i>Naegleria gruberi</i> by employing long-time phase contrast imaging that automatically tracks individual cells. We show that the cells move as a persistent random walker with two time-scales that are close to those known in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and neutrophils. Similarities were also found in the shape dynamics which are characterized by the appearance, splitting and annihilation of the curvature waves along the cell edge. Our analysis based on the Fourier descriptor and a neural network classifier point to importance of morphology features unique to <i>Naegleria</i> including complex protrusions and the transient bipolar dumbbell morphologies.",

Here we report on the characterization of a novel retrotransposon called kangaroo from the multicellular green alga, Volvox carteri. kangaroo elements are highly mobile and their expression is developmentally regulated. They probably integrate via double-stranded, closed-circle DNA intermediates through the action of an encoded recombinase related to the lambda-site-specific integrase. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that kangaroo elements are closely related to other unorthodox retrotransposons including PAT (from a nematode), DIRS-1 (from Dictyostelium), and DrDIRS1 (from zebrafish). PAT and kangaroo both contain split direct repeat (SDR) termini, and here we show that DIRS-1 and DrDIRS1 elements contain terminal features structurally related to SDRs. Thus, these mobile elements appear to define a third class of retrotransposons (the DIRS1 group) that are unified by common structural features, genes, and integration mechanisms, all of which differ from those of LTR and conventional non-LTR retrotransposons.",

A. castellanii is the only, studied to date, Amoebozoan that does not belong to Mycetozoa but possesses STATs. A sequence of the A. castellanii STAT protein includes domains similar to those of the Dictyostelium STAT proteins: a coiled coil (characteristic for Dictyostelium STAT coiled coil), a STAT DNA-binding domain and a Src-homology domain. The search for protein sequences homologous to A. castellanii STAT revealed 17 additional sequences from lower eukaryotes. Interestingly, all of these sequences come from Amoebozoa organisms that belong to either Mycetozoa (slime molds) or Centramoebida. We showed that there are four separated clades within the slime mold STAT proteins. The A. castellanii STAT protein branches next to a group of STATc proteins from Mycetozoa. We also demonstrate that Amoebozoa form a distinct monophyletic lineage within the STAT protein world that is well separated from the other groups.",

A wide variety of cells ranging from the unicellular Dictyostelium to human cells in tissues proceed through highly similar, stereotypical cell shape changes during cell division. Typically, cells first round up forming a cleavage furrow in the middle, which constricts resulting in the formation of two daughter cells. Tight control of cytokinesis is essential for proper segregation of genetic and cellular materials, and its failure is deleterious to cell viability. Thus, biological systems have developed elaborate mechanisms to ensure high fidelity of cytokinesis, including the existence of multiple biochemical and mechanical pathways regulated through feedback. In this review, we focus on the built-in redundancy of the cytoskeletal machinery that allows cells to divide successfully in a variety of biological and mechanical contexts. Using Dictyostelium cytokinesis as an example, we demonstrate that the crosstalk between biochemical and mechanical signaling through feedback ensures correct assembly and function of the cell division machinery.",

A deletion mutation in Smek2 leads to DIHC via impaired glycolysis in the livers of ExHC rats. The intracellular role of Smek2 remains obscure. We used microarrays to investigate Smek2 functions with ExHC and ExHC.BN-Dihc2<sup>BN</sup> congenic rats that harbor a non-pathological Smek2 allele from Brown-Norway rats on an ExHC background. Microarray analysis revealed that Smek2 dysfunction leads to extremely low sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh) expression in the liver of ExHC rats. Sarcosine dehydrogenase demethylates sarcosine, a byproduct of homocysteine metabolism. The ExHC rats with dysfunctional Sardh developed hypersarcosinemia and homocysteinemia, a risk factor for atherosclerosis, with or without dietary cholesterol. The mRNA expression of Bhmt, a homocysteine metabolic enzyme and the hepatic content of betaine (trimethylglycine), a methyl donor for homocysteine methylation were low in ExHC rats. Results suggest that homocysteine metabolism rendered fragile by a shortage of betaine results in homocysteinemia, and that Smek2 dysfunction causes abnormalities in sarcosine and homocysteine metabolism.",

        "abstract": "The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila replicates in phagocytes within a specific compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Formation of LCVs is a complex process requiring the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system and more than 100 translocated effector proteins, which putatively subvert cellular signaling and vesicle trafficking pathways. Phosphoinositide (PI) glycerolipids are pivotal regulators of signal transduction and membrane dynamics in eukaryotes. Recently, a number of Icm/Dot substrates were found to anchor to the LCV membrane by binding to PIs. One of these effectors, SidC, specifically interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate [PtdIns(4)P]. Using an antibody against SidC and magnetic beads coupled to a secondary antibody, intact LCVs were purified by immuno-magnetic separation, followed by density centrifugation. This purification strategy is in principle applicable to any pathogen vacuole that carries specific markers. The LCV proteome determined by LC-MS/MS revealed 566 host proteins, including novel components of the endosomal pathway, as well as the early and late secretory trafficking pathways. Thus, LCV formation is a robust process that involves many (functionally redundant) Icm/Dot substrates, as well as the interaction with different host cell vesicle trafficking pathways.",

        "abstract": "Entamoeba histolytica is one of the least understood protists in terms of taxa, clone, and kin discrimination/recognition ability. However, the capacity to tell apart same or self (clone/kin) from different or nonself (nonclone/nonkin) has long been demonstrated in pathogenic eukaryotes like Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, free-living social amebas (Dictyostelium, Polysphondylium), budding yeast (Saccharomyces), and in numerous bacteria and archaea (prokaryotes). Kin discrimination/recognition is explained under inclusive fitness theory; that is, the reproductive advantage that genetically closely related organisms (kin) can gain by cooperating preferably with one another (rather than with distantly related or unrelated individuals), minimizing antagonism and competition with kin, and excluding genetic strangers (or cheaters\u00a0=\u00a0noncooperators that benefit from others' investments in altruistic cooperation). In this review, we rely on the outcomes of in\u00a0vitro pairwise discrimination/recognition encounters between seven Entamoeba lineages to discuss the biological significance of taxa, clone, and kin discrimination/recognition in a range of generalist and specialist species (close or distantly related phylogenetically). We then focus our discussion on the importance of these laboratory observations for E.\u00a0histolytica's life cycle, host infestation, and implications of these features of the amebas' natural history for human health (including mitigation of amebiasis).",

        "abstract": "Most myosins have a positively charged loop 2 with a cluster of lysine residues that bind to the negatively charged N-terminal segment of actin. However, the net charge of loop 2 of very fast Chara myosin is zero and there is no lysine cluster in it. In contrast, Chara myosin has a highly positively charged loop 3. To elucidate the role of these unique surface loops of Chara myosin in its high velocity and high actin-activated ATPase activity, we have undertaken mutational analysis using recombinant Chara myosin motor domain. It was found that net positive charge in loop 3 affected V(max) and K(app) of actin activated ATPase activity, while it affected the velocity only slightly. The net positive charge in loop 2 affected K(app) and the velocity, although it did not affect V(max). Our results suggested that Chara myosin has evolved to have highly positively charged loop 3 for its high ATPase activity and have less positively charged loop 2 for its high velocity. Since high positive charge in loop 3 and low positive charge in loop 2 seem to be one of the reasons for Chara myosin's high velocity, we manipulated charge contents in loops 2 and 3 of Dictyostelium myosin (class II). Removing positive charge from loop 2 and adding positive charge to loop 3 of Dictyostelium myosin made its velocity higher than that of the wild type, suggesting that the charge strategy in loops 2 and 3 is widely applicable.",

        "abstract": "Bacteria trigger host defense and inflammatory processes, such as cytokine production, pyroptosis, and the chemotactic migration of immune cells toward the source of infection. However, a number of pathogens interfere with these immune functions by producing specific so-called \"effector\" proteins, which are delivered to host cells via dedicated secretion systems. Air-borne Legionella pneumophila bacteria trigger an acute and potential fatal inflammation in the lung termed Legionnaires' disease. The opportunistic pathogen L. pneumophila is a natural parasite of free-living amoebae, but also replicates in alveolar macrophages and accidentally infects humans. The bacteria employ the intracellular multiplication/defective for organelle trafficking (Icm/Dot) type IV secretion system and as many as 300 different effector proteins to govern host-cell interactions and establish in phagocytes an intracellular replication niche, the Legionella-containing vacuole. Some Icm/Dot-translocated effector proteins target cell-autonomous immunity or cell migration, i.e., they interfere with (i) endocytic, secretory, or retrograde vesicle trafficking pathways, (ii) organelle or cell motility, (iii) the inflammasome and programed cell death, or (iv) the transcription factor NF-\u03baB.

        "abstract": "Macrophages represent the most functionally versatile cells in the animal body. In addition to recognizing and destroying pathogens, macrophages remove senescent and exhausted cells, promote wound healing, and govern tissue and metabolic homeostasis. In addition, many specialized populations of tissue-resident macrophages exhibit highly specialized functions essential for the function of specific organs. Sometimes, however, macrophages cease to perform their protective function and their seemingly incomprehensible response to certain stimuli leads to pathology. In this study, we address the question of the origin of the functional versatility of macrophages. To this end, we have searched for the evolutionary origin of macrophages themselves and for the emergence of their characteristic properties. We hypothesize that many of the characteristic features of proinflammatory macrophages evolved in the unicellular ancestors of animals, and that the functional repertoire of macrophage-like amoebocytes further expanded with the evolution of multicellularity and the increasing complexity of tissues and organ systems. We suggest that the entire repertoire of macrophage functions evolved by repurposing and diversification of basic functions that evolved early in the evolution of metazoans under conditions barely comparable to that in tissues of multicellular organisms. We believe that by applying this perspective, we may find an explanation for the otherwise counterintuitive behavior of macrophages in many human pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Malaria parasites have small extremely AT-rich genomes: microsatellite repeats (1-9 bp) comprise 11% of the genome and genetic variation in natural populations is dominated by repeat changes in microsatellites rather than point mutations. This experiment was designed to quantify microsatellite mutation patterns in Plasmodium falciparum. We established 31 parasite cultures derived from a single parasite cell and maintained these for 114-267\u2009days with frequent reductions to a single cell, so parasites accumulated mutations during \u223c13,207 cell divisions. We Illumina sequenced the genomes of both progenitor and end-point mutation accumulation (MA) parasite lines in duplicate to validate stringent calling parameters. Microsatellite calls were 99.89% (GATK), 99.99% (freeBayes), and 99.96% (HipSTR) concordant in duplicate sequence runs from independent sequence libraries, whereas introduction of microsatellite mutations into the reference genome revealed a low false negative calling rate (0.68%). We observed 98 microsatellite mutations. We highlight several conclusions: microsatellite mutation rates (3.12\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7 to 2.16\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8/cell division) are associated with both repeat number and repeat motif like other organisms studied. However, 41% of changes resulted from loss or gain of more than one repeat: this was particularly true for long repeat arrays. Unlike other eukaryotes, we found no insertions or deletions that were not associated with repeats or homology regions. Overall, microsatellite mutation rates are among the lowest recorded and comparable to those in another AT-rich protozoan (Dictyostelium). However, a single infection (>1011 parasites) will still contain over 2.16\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 to 3.12\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 independent mutations at any single microsatellite locus.",

Such reaction varies according to cell type: there are both fast- and slow-crawling cells. In response to periodic stretching of the elastic substratum, the intracellular stress fibers in slow-crawling cells, such as fibroblasts, rearrange themselves perpendicular to the direction of stretching, with the result that the shape of the cells extends in that direction; whereas fast-crawling cells, such as neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells and Dictyostelium cells, which have no stress fibers, migrate perpendicular to the stretching direction. Fish epidermal keratocytes are another type of fast-crawling cell. However, they have stress fibers in the cell body, which gives them a typical slow-crawling cell structure. In response to periodic stretching of the elastic substratum, intact keratocytes rearrange their stress fibers perpendicular to the direction of stretching in the same way as fibroblasts and migrate parallel to the stretching direction, while blebbistatin-treated stress fiber-less keratocytes migrate perpendicular to the stretching direction, in the same way as seen in HL-60 cells and Dictyostelium cells. Our results indicate that keratocytes have a hybrid mechanosensing system that comprises elements of both fast- and slow-crawling cells, to generate the polarity needed for migration.",

        "abstract": "In macropinocytosis, cells take up micrometre-sized droplets of medium into internal vesicles. These vesicles are acidified and fused to lysosomes, their contents digested and useful compounds extracted. Indigestible contents can be exocytosed. Macropinocytosis has been known for approaching 100 years and is described in both metazoa and amoebae, but not in plants or fungi. Its evolutionary origin goes back to at least the common ancestor of the amoebozoa and opisthokonts, with apparent secondary loss from fungi. The primary function of macropinocytosis in amoebae and some cancer cells is feeding, but the conserved processing pathway for macropinosomes, which involves shrinkage and the retrieval of membrane to the cell surface, has been adapted in immune cells for antigen presentation. Macropinocytic cups are large actin-driven processes, closely related to phagocytic cups and pseudopods and appear to be organized around a conserved signalling patch of PIP3, active Ras and active Rac that directs actin polymerization to its periphery. Patches can form spontaneously and must be sustained by excitable kinetics with strong cooperation from the actin cytoskeleton. Growth-factor signalling shares core components with macropinocytosis, based around phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and we suggest that it evolved to take control of ancient feeding structures through a coupled growth factor receptor.

The two structurally different states that were observed in experiments correspond to the stable fixed points in the bistable regime of this model.

The Lqs system comprises the autoinducer synthase LqsA, the homologous sensor kinases LqsS and LqsT, as well as a prototypic response regulator termed LqsR. These components produce, detect, and respond to the \u03b1-hydroxyketone signaling molecule LAI-1 (<i>Legionella</i> autoinducer-1, 3-hydroxypentadecane-4-one). LAI-1-mediated signal transduction through the sensor kinases converges on LqsR, which dimerizes upon phosphorylation. The Lqs system regulates the bacterial growth phase switch, pathogen-host cell interactions, motility, natural competence, filament production, and expression of a chromosomal \"fitness island.\" Yet, LAI-1 not only mediates bacterial intra-species signaling, but also modulates the motility of eukaryotic cells through the small GTPase Cdc42 and thus promotes inter-kingdom signaling. Taken together, the low molecular weight compound LAI-1 produced by <i>L. pneumophila</i> and sensed by the bacteria as well as by eukaryotic cells plays a major role in pathogen-host cell interactions.",

We developed a computer algorithm to identify pseudopodia, and analyzed how pseudopodia of Dictyostelium cells are guided toward cAMP. Surprisingly, the direction of a pseudopod is not actively oriented toward the gradient, but is always perpendicular to the local cell curvature. The gradient induces a bias in the position where the pseudopod emerges: pseudopodia more likely emerge at the side of the cell closer to the gradient where perpendicular pseudopodia are pointed automatically toward the chemoattractant. A mutant lacking the formin dDia2 is not spherical but has many invaginations. Although pseudopodia still emerge at the side closer to the gradient, the surface curvature is so irregular that many pseudopodia are not extended toward cAMP. The results imply that the direction of the pseudopod extension, and therefore also the direction of cell movement, is dominated by two aspects: the position at the cell surface where a pseudopod emerges, and the local curvature of the membrane at that position.",

We have recently reported that phosphorylation is not required for complex activation. Rather, it occurs after Scar/WAVE has been activated, and acts as a modulator. Neither chemoattractant signaling nor Erk2 affects the amount of phosphorylation, though in Dictyostelium it is promoted by cell-substrate adhesion. We now report that cell-substrate adhesion also promotes Scar/WAVE2 phosphorylation in mammalian cells, suggesting that the process is evolutionarily conserved.",

However, there are two fundamental problems for most of these analyses; only transfers from prokaryotes are analyzed and the screening procedures applied assume that gene transfer is rare for eukaryotes. Directed studies of the impact of gene transfer on diverse eukaryotic lineages produce a much more complex picture. Many gene families are affected by multiple transfer events from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and transfers between eukaryotic lineages are routinely detected. This suggests that the assumptions applied in traditional phylogenomic approaches are too na\u00efve and result in many false negatives. This issue was recently addressed by identifying and analyzing the evolutionary history of 49 patchily distributed proteins shared between Dictyostelium and bacteria. The vast majority of these gene families showed strong indications of gene transfers, both between and within the three domains of life. However, only one of these was previously reported as a gene transfer candidate using a traditional phylogenomic approach. This clearly illustrates that more realistic assumptions are urgently needed in genome-wide studies of eukaryotic gene transfer.",

Two important questions about this polymorphism remain unresolved: how is it created, and how is it maintained.

Upon transmission of Legionella pneumophila to the lung, the pathogens employ an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to grow in LCVs within alveolar macrophages, thus triggering a severe pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. LCV formation is a complex and robust process, which requires the bacterial Icm/Dot type IV secretion system and involves the amazing number of 300 different translocated effector proteins. LCVs interact with the host cell's endosomal and secretory vesicle trafficking pathway. Accordingly, in a proteomics approach as many as 12 small Rab GTPases implicated in endosomal and secretory vesicle trafficking were identified and validated as LCV components. Moreover, the small GTPase Ran and its effector protein RanBP1 have been found to decorate the pathogen vacuole. Ran regulates nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, spindle assembly, and cytokinesis, as well as the organization of non-centrosomal microtubules. In L. pneumophila-infected amoebae or macrophages, Ran and RanBP1 localize to LCVs, and the small GTPase is activated by the Icm/Dot substrate LegG1. Ran activation by LegG1 leads to microtubule stabilization and promotes intracellular pathogen vacuole motility and bacterial growth, as well as chemotaxis and migration of Legionella-infected cells.",

Here we study this problem in the context of the two models of spatially coupled oscillators: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) and a generalization of the CGLE in which oscillators are coupled through an external medium (emCGLE). We focus on external control drives that vary in both space and time. We find that the spatial distribution of the drive signal controls the frequency ranges over which oscillators synchronize to the drive and that boundary conditions strongly influence synchronization to external drives for the CGLE. Our calculations also show that the emCGLE has a low density regime in which a broad range of frequencies can be synchronized for low drive amplitudes. We study the bifurcation structure of these models and find that they are very similar to results for the driven Kuramoto model, a system with no spatial structure. We conclude by discussing qualitative implications of our results for controlling coupled oscillator systems such as the social amoebae Dictyostelium and populations of Belousov Zhabotinsky (BZ) catalytic particles using spatially structured external drives.",

Application of exogenous EFs of similar magnitude as those found <i>in vivo</i> can direct migration, growth, and division in most cell types, ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. These EF effects have therapeutic potential, for instance, in accelerating wound healing or improving nerve repair.

        "abstract": "Propagating actin waves are dynamic supramolecular structures formed by the self-assembly of proteins within living cells. They are built from actin filaments together with single-headed myosin, the Arp23 complex, and coronin in a defined three-dimensional order. The function of these waves in structuring the cell cortex is studied on the substrate-attached surface of Dictyostelium cells by the use of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Actin waves separate two areas of the cell cortex from each other, which are distinguished by the arrangement of actin filaments. The Arp23 complex dominates in the area enclosed by a wave, where it has the capacity of building dendritic structures, while the proteins prevailing in the external area, cortexillin I and myosin-II, bundle actin filaments and arrange them in antiparallel direction. Wave propagation is accompanied by transitions in the state of actin with a preferential period of 5 min. Wave generation is preceded by local fluctuations in actin assembly, some of the nuclei of polymerized actin emanating from clathrin-coated structures, others emerging independently. The dynamics of phase transitions has been analyzed to provide a basis for modeling the nonlinear interactions that produce spatio-temporal patterns in the actin system of living cells.",

(2) The waves propagate by treadmilling with a recovery of actin incorporation after photobleaching of less than 10 seconds. (3) The waves are associated with actin-binding proteins in an ordered 3-dimensional organization: with myosin-IB at the front and close to the membrane, the Arp2/3 complex throughout the wave, and coronin at the cytoplasmic face and back of the wave. Coronin is a marker of disassembling actin structures. (4) The waves separate two areas of the cell cortex that differ in actin structure and phosphoinositide composition of the membrane.

Here, we present a 2.25 \u00c5 pre-powerstroke state (ADP\u22c5VO<sub>4</sub>) crystal structure of the human nonmuscle myosin-2C motor domain, one of the slowest myosins characterized. In combination with integrated mutagenesis, ensemble-solution kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulation approaches, the structure reveals an allosteric communication pathway that connects the distal end of the motor domain with the active site. Disruption of this pathway by mutation of hub residue R788, which forms the center of a cluster of interactions connecting the converter, the SH1-SH2 helix, the relay helix, and the lever, abolishes nonmuscle myosin-2 specific kinetic signatures. Our results provide insights into structural changes in the myosin motor domain that are triggered upon F-actin binding and contribute critically to the mechanochemical behavior of stress fibers, actin arcs, and cortical actin-based structures.",

        "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that thrives in fresh water habitats, either as planktonic form or as part of biofilms. The bacteria also grow intracellularly in free-living protozoa as well as in mammalian alveolar macrophages, thus triggering a potentially fatal pneumonia called \"Legionnaires' disease.\" To establish its intracellular niche termed the \"Legionella-containing vacuole\" (LCV), L. pneumophila employs a type IV secretion system and translocates ~300 different \"effector\" proteins into host cells. The pathogen switches between two distinct forms to grow in its extra- or intracellular niches: transmissive bacteria are virulent for phagocytes, and replicative bacteria multiply within their hosts. The switch between these forms is regulated by different metabolic cues that signal conditions favorable for replication or transmission, respectively, causing a tight link between metabolism and virulence of the bacteria. Amino acids represent the prime carbon and energy source of extra- or intracellularly growing L. pneumophila. Yet, the genome sequences of several Legionella spp. as well as transcriptome and proteome data and metabolism studies indicate that the bacteria possess broad catabolic capacities and also utilize carbohydrates such as glucose. Accordingly, L. pneumophila mutant strains lacking catabolic genes show intracellular growth defects, and thus, intracellular metabolism and virulence of the pathogen are intimately connected. In this review we will summarize recent findings on the extra- and intracellular metabolism of L. pneumophila using genetic, biochemical and cellular microbial approaches. Recent progress in this field sheds light on the complex interplay between metabolism, differentiation and virulence of the pathogen.",

These are regulated by coordinated signaling acting through G-protein coupled receptors and kinases such as PKB/AKT and SGK, as well as the actin cytoskeletal machinery. Here we show that both <i>Dictyostelium</i> PKB and SGK kinases (encoded by <i>pkbA</i> and <i>pkgB</i>) are dispensable for chemotaxis towards folate. However, both are involved in the regulation of pseudopod formation and thus cell motility. Cells lacking <i>pkbA</i> and <i>pkgB</i> showed a substantial drop in cell speed. Actin polymerization is perturbed in <i>pkbA-</i> and reduced in <i>pkgB-</i> and <i>pkbA-/pkgB-</i> mutants. The Scar/WAVE complex, key catalyst of pseudopod formation, is recruited normally to the fronts of all mutant cells (<i>pkbA</i>-, <i>pkgB</i>- and <i>pkbA</i>-/<i>pkgB</i>-), but is unexpectedly unable to recruit the Arp2/3 complex in cells lacking SGK. Consequently, loss of SGK causes a near-complete loss of normal actin pseudopodia, though this can be rescued by overexpression of PKB. Hence both PKB and SGK are required for correct assembly of F-actin and recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex by the Scar/WAVE complex during pseudopodia formation.",

While some cell movement is random, directed movement stimulated by extracellular signals is our focus here. This involves a sequence of steps in which cells first detect extracellular chemical and/or mechanical signals via membrane receptors that activate signal transduction cascades and produce intracellular signals. These intracellular signals control the motile machinery of the cell and thereby determine the spatial localization of the sites of force generation needed to produce directed motion. Understanding how force generation within cells and mechanical interactions with their surroundings, including other cells, are controlled in space and time to produce cell-level movement is a major challenge, and involves many issues that are amenable to mathematical modelling.",

One known way in which ancient natural forces affect development, phylogeny and physiology is through gravitational effects that have evolved as mechanotransduction, seen in the lung, kidney and bone, linking as molecular homologies to skin and brain. Tracing the ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes that have facilitated mechanotransduction identifies specific homologous cell-types and functional molecular markers for lung homeostasis that reveal how and why complex physiologic traits have evolved from the unicellular to the multicellular state. Such data are reinforced by their reverse-evolutionary patterns in chronic degenerative diseases. The physiologic responses of model organisms like Dictyostelium and yeast to gravity provide deep comparative molecular phenotypic homologies, revealing mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) as the final common pathway for vertical integration of vertebrate physiologic evolution; mTOR integrates calcium/lipid epistatic balance as both the proximate and ultimate positive selection pressure for vertebrate physiologic evolution. The commonality of all vertebrate structure-function relationships can be reduced to calcium/lipid homeostatic regulation as the fractal unit of vertebrate physiology, demonstrating the primacy of the unicellular state as the fundament of physiologic evolution.",

Whereas pseudopod extension by actin polymerization has been intensively researched, less attention has been paid to how the rest of the actin cytoskeleton such as the actin cortex contributes to cell migration. In this study, cortical actin and myosin II filaments were simultaneously observed in migrating Dictyostelium cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The cortical actin and myosin II filaments remained stationary with respect to the substratum as the cells advanced. However, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments and direct observation of filaments showed that they rapidly turned over. When the cells were detached from the substratum, the actin and myosin filaments displayed a vigorous retrograde flow. Thus, when the cells migrate on the substratum, the cortical cytoskeleton firmly holds the substratum to generate the motive force instead. The present studies also demonstrate how myosin II localizes to the rear region of the migrating cells. The observed dynamic turnover of actin and myosin II filaments contributes to the recycling of their subunits across the whole cell and enables rapid reorganization of the cytoskeleton.",

However, recent interest has focused on 'self-generated' gradients, in which cell populations create their own local gradients as they move. Here, we consider the interplay between chemoattractants and single cells. To achieve this, we extend a recently developed computational model to incorporate breakdown of extracellular attractants by membrane-bound enzymes. Model equations are parametrized, using the published estimates from <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells chemotaxing towards cyclic AMP. We find that individual cells can substantially modulate their local attractant field under physiologically appropriate conditions of attractant and enzymes. This means the attractant concentration perceived by receptors can be a small fraction of the ambient concentration. This allows efficient chemotaxis in chemoattractant concentrations that would be saturating without local breakdown. Similar interactions in which cells locally mould a stimulus could function in many types of directed cell motility, including haptotaxis, durotaxis and even electrotaxis.",

Visual- and beta-arrestins have a two-lobe, immunoglobulin-like, beta-strand sandwich structure. The recent resolution of the crystal structure of VPS26, one of the retromer subunits, unexpectedly evidences an arrestin fold in this protein, which is otherwise unrelated to arrestins. From a functional point of view, VPS26 is involved in the retrograde transport of the mannose 6-P receptor from the endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. In addition to the group of genuine arrestins and Vps26, mammalian cells harbor a vast repertoire of proteins that are related to arrestins on the basis of their PFAM Nter and Cter arrestin- domains, which are named Arrestin Domain- Containing proteins (ADCs). The biological role of ADC proteins is still poorly understood. The three subfamilies have been merged into an arrestin-related protein clan.This paper provides an overall analysis of arrestin clan proteins. The structures and functions of members of the subfamilies are reviewed in mammals and model organisms such as Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, Saccharomyces and Dictyostelium.",

Signaling pathways capable of short-term adaptation are found in systems as diverse as the high osmolarity response of yeast, gradient sensing in Dictyostelium, and the cytokine response in vertebrates. Using mathematical analysis and computational experiments, we compare different feedback architectures in terms of response amplitude and duration, ability to adapt, and response to variable stimulus levels. Our analysis reveals three important features of these systems: 1), multiple step signaling cascades improve sensitivity to low doses by an effect distinct from signal amplification; 2), some feedback architectures act as signal transducers converting stimulus strength into response duration; and 3), feedback deactivation acts as a dose-dependent switch between transient and sustained responses. Finally, we present characteristic features for each form of feedback regulation that can aid in their identification.",

Several point mutations within the SH1 helix in human myosin IIs have been shown to cause diseases. To reveal whether these SH1 helix mutations affect not only motile activities but also thermal properties of myosin II, here we introduced the E683K or R686C point mutation into the SH1 helix in <i>Dictyostelium</i> myosin II. Thermal inactivation as well as thermal aggregation rates of these mutant proteins demonstrated that these mutations decreased the thermal stability of myosin II. Temperature dependence of sliding velocities of actin filaments showed that these mutations also reduced the activation energy of a rate-limiting process involved in actin movement. Given that these mutations are likely to alter coupling between the subdomains, and thus their thermal fluctuations, we propose that the SH1 helix is a key structural element that determines the flexibility and thermal properties of the myosin motor. These characteristics of the SH1 helix may contribute to the pathogenesis of the human diseases caused by mutations within this structural element.",

        "abstract": "The morphological diversity of animals, fungi, plants, and other multicellular organisms stems from the fact that each lineage acquired multicellularity independently. A prerequisite for each origin of multicellularity was the evolution of mechanisms for stable cell-cell adhesion or attachment. Recent advances in comparative genomics and phylogenetics provide critical insights into the evolutionary foundations of cell adhesion. Reconstructing the evolution of cell junction proteins in animals and their unicellular relatives exemplifies the roles of co-option and innovation. Comparative studies of volvocine algae reveal specific molecular changes that accompanied the evolution of multicellularity in Volvox. Comparisons between animals and Dictyostelium show how commonalities and differences in the biology of unicellular ancestors influenced the evolution of adhesive mechanisms. Understanding the unicellular ancestry of cell adhesion helps illuminate the basic cell biology of multicellular development in modern organisms.",

The Rho-family GTPases are a key convergence point of these pathways. Their effectors include actin regulators such as formins, members of the WASP/WAVE family and the Arp2/3 complex, and the myosin II motor protein. Pathways that link to the Rho GTPases include Ras GTPases, TorC2, and PI3K. Many of the molecules involved form gradients within cells, which define the front and rear of migrating cells, and are also established in related cellular behaviors such as neuronal growth cone extension and cytokinesis. The signaling molecules that regulate migration can be integrated to provide a model of network function. The network displays biochemical excitability seen as spontaneous waves of activation that propagate along the cell cortex. These events coordinate cell movement and can be biased by external cues to bring about directed migration.",

The mechanisms that maintain those PIP3 domains in three-dimensional space remain elusive, due to limitations in observation and analysis techniques. Recently, a strong relation between the cell geometry, the spatial confinement of the membrane, and the excitable signal transduction system has been revealed by H\u00f6rning and Shibata (2019) using a novel 3D spatiotemporal analysis methodology that enables the study of membrane signaling on the entire membrane (H\u00f6rning and Shibata, 2019). Here, using 3D spatial fluctuation and phase map analysis on actin polymerization inhibited <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells, we reveal a spatial asymmetry of PIP3 signaling on the membrane that is mediated by the contact perimeter of the plasma membrane - the spatial boundary around the cell-substrate adhered area on the plasma membrane. We show that the contact perimeter guides PIP3 waves and acts as a pinning site of PIP3 phase singularities, that is, the center point of spiral waves. The contact perimeter serves as a diffusion influencing boundary that is regulated by a cell size- and shape-dependent curvature. Our findings suggest an underlying mechanism that explains how local curvature can favor actin polymerization when PIP3 domains get pinned at the curved protrusive membrane edges in amoeboid cells.",

Motors are adapted to their function, in part, by tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of steps in this cycle. However, it remains unclear how sequence encodes these differences, since biochemically distinct motors often have nearly indistinguishable crystal structures. We hypothesized that sequences produce distinct biochemical phenotypes by modulating the relative probabilities of an ensemble of conformations primed for different functional roles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the distribution of conformations for 12 myosin motor domains by building Markov state models (MSMs) from an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing motors reveals shifts in the balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop conformations that predict experimentally measured duty ratios and ADP release rates better than sequence or individual structures. This result demonstrates the power of an ensemble perspective for interrogating sequence-function relationships.",

In this study, we found that the Dot/Icm effector Lem8 (Lpg1290) is a protease whose activity is catalyzed by a Cys-His-Asp motif known to be associated with diverse biochemical activities. Intriguingly, we found that Lem8 interacts with the host regulatory protein 14-3-3\u03b6, which activates its protease activity. Furthermore, Lem8 undergoes self-cleavage in a process that requires 14-3-3\u03b6.

It has long been documented that the LCV is associated with mitochondria and a number of Dot/Icm effectors have been shown to target to this organelle. Yet, the biochemical function and host cell target of most of these effectors remain unknown. Here, we found that the Dot/Icm substrate Ceg3 (Lpg0080) is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that localizes to the mitochondria in host cells where it attacks ADP/ATP translocases by ADP-ribosylation, and blunts their ADP/ATP exchange activity.

Unlike its animal counterparts, Skp1 from <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is hydroxylated by an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PhyA), and the resulting hydroxyproline can subsequently be modified by a five-sugar chain. A similar modification is found in the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i>, where it regulates SCF assembly and O<sub>2</sub>-dependent development. Homologous glycosyltransferases assemble a similar core trisaccharide in both organisms, and a bifunctional \u03b1-galactosyltransferase from CAZy family GT77 mediates the addition of the final two sugars in <i>Dictyostelium</i>, generating Gal\u03b11, 3Gal\u03b11,3Fuc\u03b11,2Gal\u03b21,3GlcNAc\u03b11-. Here, we found that <i>Toxoplasma</i> utilizes a cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase from an ancient clade of CAZy family GT32 to catalyze transfer of the fourth sugar. Catalytically active Glt1 was required for the addition of the terminal disaccharide in cells, and cytosolic extracts catalyzed transfer of [<sup>3</sup>H]glucose from UDP-[<sup>3</sup>H]glucose to the trisaccharide form of Skp1 in a <i>glt1</i>-dependent fashion. Recombinant Glt1 catalyzed the same reaction, confirming that it directly mediates Skp1 glucosylation, and NMR demonstrated formation of a Glc\u03b11,3Fuc linkage. Recombinant Glt1 strongly preferred the full core trisaccharide attached to Skp1 and labeled only Skp1 in <i>glt1</i>\u0394 extracts, suggesting specificity for Skp1. <i>glt1</i>-knock-out parasites exhibited a growth defect not rescued by catalytically inactive Glt1, indicating that the glycan acts in concert with the first enzyme in the pathway, PhyA, in cells. A genomic bioinformatics survey suggested that Glt1 belongs to the ancestral Skp1 glycosylation pathway in protists and evolved separately from related Golgi-resident GT32 glycosyltransferases.",

        "abstract": "Recently, it has been reported that the cells of the immune system, as well as Dictyostelium amoebae, can swim in a bulk fluid by changing their shape repeatedly. We refer to this motion as amoeboid swimming. Here, we explore how the propulsion and the deformation of the cell emerge as an interplay between the active forces that the cell employs to activate the shape changes and the passive, viscoelastic response of the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the surrounding environment. We introduce a model in which the cell is represented by an elastic capsule enclosing a viscous liquid. The motion of the cell is activated by time-dependent forces distributed along its surface. The model is solved numerically using the boundary integral formulation. The cell can swim in a fluid medium using cyclic deformations or strokes. We measure the swimming velocity of the cell as a function of the force amplitude, the stroke frequency, and the viscoelastic properties of the cell and the medium. We show that an increase in the shear modulus leads both to a regular slowdown of the swimming, which is more pronounced for more deflated swimmers, and to a tendency toward cell buckling. For a given stroke frequency, the swimming velocity shows a quadratic dependence on force amplitude for small forces, as expected, but saturates for large forces. We propose a scaling relationship for the dependence of swimming velocity on the relevant parameters that qualitatively reproduces the numerical results and allows us to define regimes in which the cell motility is dominated by elastic response or by the effective cortex viscosity. This leads to an estimate of the effective cortex viscosity of 10<sup>3</sup> Pa \u22c5 s for which the two effects are comparable, which is close to that provided by several experiments.",

This pioneering research had an animal behavior approach. During the 2000s, work on taxa-, clone- and kin-discrimination and recognition in protists produced genetic and molecular evidence that unicellular organisms (e.g. Saccharomyces, Dictyostelium, Polysphondylium, Tetrahymena, Entamoeba and Plasmodium) could distinguish between same (self or clone) and different (diverse clones), as well as among conspecifics of close or distant genetic relatedness. Here, we discuss some of the research on the genetics of kin discrimination/recognition and highlight the scientific progress made by switching emphasis from investigating multicellular to unicellular systems (and backwards). We document how studies with protists are helping us to understand the microscopic, cellular origins and evolution of the mechanisms of kin discrimination/recognition and their significance for the advent of multicellularity. We emphasize that because protists are among the most ancient organisms on Earth, belong to multiple taxonomic groups and occupy all environments, they can be central to reexamining traditional hypotheses in\u00a0the field of kin recognition, reformulating concepts, and generating new knowledge.",

        "abstract": "African trypanosomes, parasites that cause human sleeping sickness, undergo a density-dependent differentiation in the bloodstream of their mammalian hosts. This process is driven by a released parasite-derived factor that causes parasites to accumulate in G1 and become quiescent. This is accompanied by morphological transformation to 'stumpy' forms that are adapted to survival and further development when taken up in the blood meal of tsetse flies, the vector for trypanosomiasis. Although the soluble signal driving differentiation to stumpy forms is unidentified, a recent genome-wide RNAi screen identified many of the intracellular signalling and effector molecules required for the response to this signal. These resemble components of nutritional starvation and quiescence pathways in other eukaryotes, suggesting that parasite development shares similarities with the adaptive quiescence of organisms such as yeasts and Dictyostelium in response to nutritional starvation and stress. Here, the trypanosome signalling pathway is discussed in the context of these conserved pathways and the possible contributions of opposing 'slender retainer' and 'stumpy inducer' arms described. As evolutionarily highly divergent eukaryotes, the organisation and conservation of this developmental pathway can provide insight into the developmental cycle of other protozoan parasites, as well as the adaptive and programmed developmental responses of all eukaryotic cells.",

        "abstract": "Studies in the model systems, <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae and HL-60 neutrophils, have shown that local Ras activity directly regulates cell motility or polarity. Localized Ras activation on the membrane is spatiotemporally regulated by its activators, RasGEFs, and inhibitors, RasGAPs, which might be expected to create a stable 'front' and 'back', respectively, in migrating cells. Focusing on C2GAPB in amoebae and RASAL3 in neutrophils, we investigated how Ras activity along the cortex controls polarity. Since existing gene knockout and overexpression studies can be circumvented, we chose optogenetic approaches to assess the immediate, local effects of these Ras regulators on the cell cortex. In both cellular systems, optically targeting the respective RasGAPs to the cell front extinguished existing protrusions and changed the direction of migration, as might be expected. However, when the expression of C2GAPB was induced globally, amoebae polarized within hours. Furthermore, within minutes of globally recruiting either C2GAPB in amoebae or RASAL3 in neutrophils, each cell type polarized and moved more rapidly. Targeting the RasGAPs to the cell backs exaggerated these effects on migration and polarity. Overall, in both cell types, RasGAP-mediated polarization was brought about by increased actomyosin contractility at the back and sustained, localized F-actin polymerization at the front. These experimental results were accurately captured by computational simulations in which Ras levels control front and back feedback loops. The discovery that context-dependent Ras activity on the cell cortex has counterintuitive, unanticipated effects on cell polarity can have important implications for future drug-design strategies targeting oncogenic Ras.",

Previously, we found that chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells preferentially bleb from concave regions, where membrane tension facilitates membrane-cortex detachment. Now, through a novel modeling approach based on actual cell contours, we use cell geometry to predict where blebs will form in migrating cells. We find that cell geometry alone, and by implication, physical forces in the membrane, is sufficient to predict the location of blebs in rounded cells moving in a highly resistive environment. The model is less successful with more polarized cells moving against less resistance, but can be greatly improved by positing a front-to-back gradient in membrane-cortex adhesion. In accord with this prediction, we find that Talin, which links membrane and cortex, forms such a front-to-back gradient. Thus our model provides a means of dissecting out the role of physical forces in controlling where blebs form, and shows that in certain circumstances they could be the major determining factor.",

Pum2 transcripts were expressed in all murine tissues examined, suggesting the gene influences processes common to many cell types. Like all Puf family members, PUM2 contains a C-terminal RNA-binding domain related to the Drosophila Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD). Two features found in the amino-terminus of PUM2, regions rich in serine and glutamine/alanine-rich regions, were also identified in most Puf family members. RNA sequences capable of binding with high affinity (6.5 nM) to a 48-kDa recombinant protein containing the PUM2 PUM-HD were isolated by using an iterative amplification-selection protocol (SELEX). The consensus sequence [UGUANAUARNNNNBBBBSCCS] of the PUM2 binding element (PBE) is related to, but distinct from, the 3' end of the Drosophila Nanos response element. The characterization of PUM2 and potential RNA-binding site will assist efforts to assess the extent and mechanism by which mammalian genes are regulated at a posttranscriptional level.",

        "abstract": "The contractile vacuole (CV) is a dynamic organelle that enables Dictyostelium amoeba and other protist to maintain osmotic homeostasis by expelling excess water. In the present study, we have uncovered a mechanism that coordinates the mechanics of the CV with myosin II, regulated by VwkA, an unconventional protein kinase that is conserved in an array of protozoa. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VwkA fusion proteins localize persistently to the CV during both filling and expulsion phases of water. In vwkA null cells, the established CV marker dajumin still localizes to the CV, but these structures are large, spherical and severely impaired for discharge. Furthermore, myosin II cortical localization and assembly are abnormal in vwkA null cells. Parallel analysis of wild-type cells treated with myosin II inhibitors or of myosin II null cells also results in enlarged CVs with impaired dynamics. We suggest that the myosin II cortical cytoskeleton, regulated by VwkA, serves a critical conserved role in the periodic contractions of the CV, as part of the osmotic protective mechanism of protozoa.",

        "abstract": "The polarized distribution of F-actin is important in providing the driving force for directional migration in mammalian leukocytes and Dictyostelium cells, in which compartmentation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphatidylinositol phosphatase is critical for the establishment of cell polarity. Since monospores from the red alga Porphyra yezoensis are a real example of migrating plant cells, the involvement of the cytoskeleton and PI3K was investigated during their early development. Our results indicate that the asymmetrical localization of F-actin at the leading edge is fixed by the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis in migrating monospores, which is PI3K-dependent and protein synthesis-independent. After migration, monospores adhere to the substratum and then become upright, developing into multicellular thalli via the establishment of the apical-basal axis. In this process, F-actin usually accumulates at the bottom of the basal cell and development after migration requires new protein synthesis. These findings suggest that the establishment of anterior-posterior and apical-basal axes are differentially regulated during the early development of monospores. Our results also indicate that PI3K-dependent F-actin asymmetry is evolutionally conserved in relation to the establishment of cell polarity in migrating eukaryotic cells.",

        "abstract": "Osteoclasts form a specialized cell-matrix adhesion structure, known as the \"sealing zone\", during bone resorption. The sealing zone is a dynamic actin-rich structure that defines the resorption area of the bone. The detailed dynamics and fine structure of the sealing zone have been elusive. Osteoclasts plated on glass do not form a sealing zone, but generate a separate supra-molecular structure called the \"podosome belt\". Podosomes are integrin-based adhesion complexes involved in matrix adhesion, cell migration, matrix degradation, and mechanosensing. Invadopodia, podosome-like protrusions in cancer cells, are involved in cell invasion into other tissues by promoting matrix degradation. Both podosomes and invadopodia exhibit actin pattern transitions during maturation. We previously found that Arp2/3-dependent actin flow occurs in all observed assembly patterns of podosomes in osteoclasts on glass. It is known that the actin wave in <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells exhibits a similar pattern transition in its evolution. Because of significant advances in our understanding regarding the mechanism of podosomes/invadopodia formation over the last decade, we revisited the structure and function of the sealing zone in this review, highlighting the possible involvement of self-organized actin waves in the organogenesis of the sealing zone.",

        "abstract": "Formins, proteins defined by the presence of an FH2 domain and their ability to nucleate linear F-actin de novo, play a key role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Initially thought to primarily regulate actin, recent studies have highlighted a role for formins in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, and most recently have uncovered the ability of some formins to coordinate the organization of both the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. While biochemical analyses of this family of proteins have yielded many insights into how formins regulate diverse cytoskeletal reorganizations, we are only beginning to appreciate how and when these functional properties are relevant to biological processes in a developmental or organismal context. Developmental genetic studies in fungi, Dictyostelium, vertebrates, plants and other model organisms have revealed conserved roles for formins in cell polarity, actin cable assembly and cytokinesis. However, roles have also been discovered for formins that are specific to particular organisms. Thus, formins perform both global and specific functions, with some of these roles concurring with previous biochemical data and others exposing new properties of formins. While not all family members have been examined across all organisms, the analyses to date highlight the significance of the flexibility within the formin family to regulate a broad spectrum of diverse cytoskeletal processes during development.",

Although treating the cell as a 2D entity has proven effective in understanding how cells locomote, and in identifying defects in a variety of mutant and abnormal cells, there are cases in which 3D reconstruction and analysis are essential. Here, we describe advanced computer-assisted 3D reconstruction and motion analysis programs for both individual live, crawling cells and developing embryos.

Because all images are converted to mathematical representations, a variety of motility and dynamic morphology parameters can be computed that have proven quite valuable in the identification of mutant behaviors.

        "abstract": "Small GTPases are the key to actin cytoskeleton signaling, which opens the lock of effector proteins to forward the signal downstream in several cellular pathways. Actin cytoskeleton assembly is associated with cell polarity, adhesion, movement and other functions in eukaryotic cells. Rho proteins, specifically Cdc42 and Rac, are the primary regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in higher and lower eukaryotes. Effector proteins, present in an inactive state gets activated after binding to the GTP bound Cdc42/Rac to relay a signal downstream. Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif is an essential conserved sequence found in effector proteins to interact with Cdc42 or Rac. A diverse range of Cdc42/Rac and their effector proteins have evolved from lower to higher eukaryotes. The present study has identified and further classified CRIB containing effector proteins in lower eukaryotes, focusing on parasitic protozoans causing neglected tropical diseases and taking human proteins as a reference point to the highest evolved organism in the evolutionary trait. Lower eukaryotes' CRIB containing proteins fall into conventional effector molecules, PAKs (p21 activated kinase), Wiskoit-Aldrich Syndrome proteins family, and some have unique domain combinations unlike any known proteins. We also highlight the correlation between the effector protein isoforms and their selective specificity for Cdc42 or Rac proteins during evolution. Here, we report CRIB containing effector proteins; ten in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and <i>Entamoeba</i>, fourteen in <i>Acanthamoeba</i>, one in <i>Trypanosoma</i> and <i>Giardia</i>. CRIB containing effector proteins that have been studied so far in humans are potential candidates for drug targets in cancer, neurological disorders, and others. Conventional CRIB containing proteins from protozoan parasites remain largely elusive and our data provides their identification and classification for further in-depth functional validations. The tropical diseases caused by protozoan parasites lack combinatorial drug targets as effective paradigms. Targeting signaling mechanisms operative in these pathogens can provide greater molecules in combatting their infections.",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotic cells, including neutrophils and <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells, are able to undergo correlated random migration in the absence of directional cues while reacting to shallow gradients of chemoattractants with exquisite precision. Although progress has been made with regard to molecular identities, it remains elusive how molecular mechanics are integrated with cell mechanics to initiate and manipulate cell motility. Here, we propose a two dimensional (2D) cell migration model wherein a multilayered dynamic seesaw mechanism is accompanied by a mechanical strain-based inhibition mechanism. In biology, these two mechanisms can be mapped onto the biochemical feedback between phosphoinositides (PIs) and Rho GTPase and the mechanical interplay between filamin A (FLNa) and FilGAP. Cell migration and the accompanying morphological changes are demonstrated in numerical simulations using a particle-spring model, and the diffusion in the cell membrane are simulations using a one dimensional (1D) finite differences method (FDM). The fine balance established between endogenous signaling and a mechanically governed inactivation scheme ensures the endogenous cycle of self-organizing pseudopods, accounting for the correlated random migration. Furthermore, this model cell manifests directional and adaptable responses to shallow graded signaling, depending on the overwhelming effect of the graded stimuli guidance on strain-based inhibition. Finally, the model cell becomes trapped within an obstacle-ridden spatial region, manifesting a shuttle run for local explorations and can chemotactically \"escape\", illustrating again the balance required in the complementary signaling pathways.",

Theoretical studies have suggested the possible coexistence of traveling and standing waves in excitable systems. Here, we demonstrate the direct transformation of a traveling into a standing wave and establish conditions for the stability of this conversion. This theory combines excitable wave stopping and the emergence of a family of standing waves at zero velocity, without altering diffusion parameters. Experimentally, we show the existence of this phenomenon on the cell cortex of some <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian mutant strains. We further predict a template that encompasses a spectrum of protrusive phenotypes, including pseudopodia and filopodia, through transitions between traveling and standing waves, allowing the cell to switch between excitability and bistability. Overall, this suggests that a previously-unidentified method of pattern formation, in which traveling waves spread, stop, and turn into standing waves that rearrange to form stable patterns, governs cell motility.",

In the presence of traveling chemical waves, however, amoebae migrate counter to the running wave. Such behavior, referred to as diffusing wave paradox, suggests the existence of adaptation and directional memory. Here we experimentally investigate the response of phototactic self-propelled microparticles to traveling light-pulses. Despite their entirely memory-less (i.e., strictly local) response to the environment, we observe the same phenomenological behavior, i.e., particle motion counter to the pulse direction. Our findings are supported by a minimal model which considers active particle reorientations within local light gradients. The complex and robust behavior of synthetic active particles to spatially and temporally varying stimuli enables new strategies for achieving collective behavior and can be used for the design of micro-robotic systems with limited signal-processing capabilities.",

In this study, an isoform of Atg8 was identified and characterized in Acanthamoeba castellanii (AcAtg8b). AcAtg8b protein was found to encode 132 amino acids and to be longer than AcAtg8 protein, which encoded 117 amino acids. Real-time PCR analysis showed high expression levels of AcAtg8b and AcAtg8 during encystation. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that AcAtg8b is involved in the formation of the autophagosomal membrane. Chemically synthesized siRNA against AcAtg8b reduced the encystation efficiency of Acanthamoeba, confirming that AcAtg8b, like AcAtg8, is an essential component of cyst formation in Acanthamoeba. Our findings suggest that Acanthamoeba has doubled the number of Atg8 gene copies to ensure the successful encystation for survival when 1 copy is lost. These 2 types of Atg8 identified in Acanthamoeba provide important information regarding autophagy formation, encystation mechanism, and survival of primitive, cyst-forming protozoan parasites.",

Expression of wild type CRN7 in CRN7 deficient cells rescued these defects, whereas proteins with mutations in the CRIB motifs which were associated with altered Rac binding were effective to varying degrees. The presence of one functional CRIB was sufficient to reestablish phagocytosis, cell motility and development.

The Rho small GTP(guanosine 5'-tri phosphate)ases have been shown to regulate cell polarity; however, its mechanism of emergence has yet to be clarified. We first developed a reaction-diffusion model of the Rho GTPases, which exhibits switch-like reversible response to a gradient of extracellular signals, exclusive accumulation of Cdc42 and Rac, or RhoA at the maximal or minimal intensity of the signal, respectively, and tracking of changes of a signal gradient by the polarized peak. The previous cell polarity models proposed by Subramanian and Narang show similar behaviors to our Rho GTPase model, despite the difference in molecular networks. This led us to compare these models, and we found that these models commonly share instability and a mass conservation of components. Based on these common properties, we developed conceptual models of a mass conserved reaction-diffusion system with diffusion-driven instability. These conceptual models retained similar behaviors of cell polarity in the Rho GTPase model. Using these models, we numerically and analytically found that multiple polarized peaks are unstable, resulting in a single stable peak (uniqueness of axis), and that sensitivity toward changes of a signal gradient is specifically restricted at the polarized peak (localized sensitivity). Although molecular networks may differ from one cell type to another, the behaviors of cell polarity in migrating cells seem similar, suggesting that there should be a fundamental principle. Thus, we propose that a mass conserved reaction-diffusion system with diffusion-driven instability is one of such principles of cell polarity.",

It transports a variety of cargoes and has numerous functions during spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. It is a large complex of about 1.4 MDa composed of six different subunits, interacting with a multitude of different partners. Most biochemical studies have been performed either with the native mammalian cytoplasmic dynein complex purified from tissue or, more recently, with recombinant dynein fragments from budding yeast and Dictyostelium. Hardly any information exists about the properties of human dynein. Moreover, experiments with an entire human dynein complex prepared from recombinant subunits with a well-defined composition are lacking. Here, we reconstitute a complete cytoplasmic dynein complex using recombinant human subunits and characterize its biochemical and motile properties. Using analytical gel filtration, sedimentation-velocity ultracentrifugation, and negative-stain electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the smaller subunits of the complex have an important structural function for complex integrity. Fluorescence microscopy experiments reveal that while engaged in collective microtubule transport, the recombinant human cytoplasmic dynein complex is an active, microtubule minus-end-directed motor, as expected. However, in contrast to recombinant dynein of nonmetazoans, individual reconstituted human dynein complexes did not show robust processive motility, suggesting a more intricate mechanism of processivity regulation for the human dynein complex. In the future, the comparison of reconstituted dynein complexes from different species promises to provide molecular insight into the mechanisms regulating the various functions of these large molecular machines.",

        "title": "Clueless, a conserved Drosophila gene required for mitochondrial subcellular localization, interacts genetically with parkin.",
        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has been linked to altered mitochondrial function. Mutations in parkin (park), the Drosophila ortholog of a human gene that is responsible for many familial cases of Parkinson's disease, shorten life span, abolish fertility and disrupt mitochondrial structure. However, the role played by Park in mitochondrial function remains unclear. Here, we describe a novel Drosophila gene, clueless (clu), which encodes a highly conserved tetratricopeptide repeat protein that is related closely to the CluA protein of Dictyostelium, Clu1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to similar proteins in diverse metazoan eukaryotes from Arabidopsis to humans. Like its orthologs, loss of Drosophila clu causes mitochondria to cluster within cells. We find that strong clu mutations resemble park mutations in their effects on mitochondrial function and that the two genes interact genetically. Conversely, mitochondria in park homozygotes become highly clustered. We propose that Clu functions in a novel pathway that positions mitochondria within the cell based on their physiological state. Disruption of the Clu pathway may enhance oxidative damage, alter gene expression, cause mitochondria to cluster at microtubule plus ends, and lead eventually to mitochondrial failure.",

        "abstract": "The replication-dependent histone mRNAs in metazoa are not polyadenylated, in contrast to the bulk of mRNA. Instead, they contain an RNA stem-loop (SL) structure close to the 3' end of the mature RNA, and this 3' end is generated by cleavage using a machinery involving the U7 snRNP and protein factors such as the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). This machinery of 3' end processing is related to that of polyadenylation as protein components are shared between the systems. It is commonly believed that histone 3' end processing is restricted to metazoa and green algae. In contrast, polyadenylation is ubiquitous in Eukarya. However, using computational approaches, we have now identified components of histone 3' end processing in a number of protozoa. Thus, the histone mRNA stem-loop structure as well as the SLBP protein are present in many different protozoa, including Dictyostelium, alveolates, Trypanosoma, and Trichomonas. These results show that the histone 3' end processing machinery is more ancient than previously anticipated and can be traced to the root of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree. We also identified histone mRNAs from both metazoa and protozoa that are polyadenylated but also contain the signals characteristic of histone 3' end processing. These results provide further evidence that some histone genes are regulated at the level of 3' end processing to produce either polyadenylated RNAs or RNAs with the 3' end characteristic of replication-dependent histone mRNAs.",

        "abstract": "Among animals, urochordates (e.g., ascidians) are unique in their ability to biosynthesize cellulose. In ascidians cellulose is synthesized in the epidermis and incorporated into a protective coat know as the tunic. A putative cellulose synthase-like gene was first identified in the genome sequences of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. We describe here a cellulose synthase gene from the ascidian Ciona savignyi that is expressed in the epidermis. The predicted C. savignyi cellulose synthase amino acid sequence showed conserved features found in all cellulose synthases, including plants, but was most similar to cellulose synthases from bacteria, fungi, and Dictyostelium discoidium. However, unlike other known cellulose synthases, the predicted C. savignyi polypeptide has a degenerate cellulase-like region near the carboxyl-terminal end. An expression construct carrying the C. savignyi cDNA was found to restore cellulose biosynthesis to a cellulose synthase (CelA) minus mutant of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, showing that the predicted protein has cellulose synthase activity. The lack of cellulose biosynthesis in all other groups of metazoans and the similarity of the C. savignyi cellulose synthase to enzymes from cellulose-producing organisms support the hypothesis that the urochordates acquired the cellulose biosynthetic pathway by horizontal transfer.",

        "abstract": "Navigation of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of infection to lymphoid organs is guided by concentration gradients of CCR7 ligands. How cells interpret chemokine gradients and how they couple directional sensing to polarization and persistent chemotaxis has remained largely elusive. Previous experimental systems were limited in the ability to control fast <i>de novo</i> formation of the final gradient slope, long-lasting stability of the gradient and to expose cells to dynamic stimulation. Here, we used a combination of microfluidics and quantitative <i>in vitro</i> live cell imaging to elucidate the chemotactic sensing strategy of DCs. The microfluidic approach allows us to generate soluble gradients with high spatio-temporal precision and to analyze actin dynamics, cell polarization, and persistent directional migration in both static and dynamic environments. We demonstrate that directional persistence of DC migration requires steady-state characteristics of the soluble gradient instead of temporally rising CCL19 concentration, implying that spatial sensing mechanisms control chemotaxis of DCs. Kymograph analysis of actin dynamics revealed that the presence of the CCL19 gradient is essential to stabilize leading edge protrusions in DCs and to determine directionality, since both cytoskeletal polarization and persistent chemotaxis are abrogated in the range of seconds when steady-state gradients are perturbed. In contrast to <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoeba, DCs are unable to decode oscillatory stimulation of soluble chemokine traveling waves into a directional response toward the wave source. These findings are consistent with the notion that DCs do not employ adaptive temporal sensing strategies that discriminate temporally increasing and decreasing chemoattractant concentrations in our setting. Taken together, in our experimental system DCs do not depend on increasing absolute chemokine concentration over time to induce persistent migration and do not integrate oscillatory stimulation. The observed capability of DCs to migrate with high directional persistence in stable gradients but not when subjected to periodic temporal cues, identifies spatial sensing as a key requirement for persistent chemotaxis of DCs.",

        "abstract": "p67 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein of the terminal lysosome of African trypanosomes. Its biosynthesis involves transport of an initial gp100 ER precursor to the lysosome, followed by cleavage to N-terminal (gp32) and C-terminal (gp42) subunits that remain non-covalently associated. p67 knockdown is lethal, but the only overt phenotype is an enlarged lysosome (~250 to >1000 nm). Orthologues have been characterized in Dictyostelium and mammals. These have processing pathways similar to p67, and are thought to have phospholipase B-like (PLBL) activity. The mouse PLBD2 crystal structure revealed that the PLBLs represent a subgroup of the larger N-terminal nucleophile (NTN) superfamily, all of which are hydrolases. NTNs activate by internal autocleavage mediated by a nucleophilic residue, i.e. Cys, Ser or Thr, on the upstream peptide bond to form N-terminal \u03b1 (gp32) and C-terminal \u03b2 (gp42) subunits that remain non-covalently associated. The N-terminal residue of the \u03b2 subunit is then catalytic in subsequent hydrolysis reactions. All PLBLs have a conserved Cys/Ser dipeptide at the \u03b1/\u03b2 junction (Cys241/Ser242 in p67), mutation of which renders p67 non-functional in RNAi rescue assays. p67 orthologues are found in many clades of parasitic protozoa, thus p67 is the founding member of a group of hydrolases that likely play a role broadly in the pathogenesis of parasitic infections.",

        "abstract": "Retrotransposons are genetic elements that are similar in structure and life cycle to retroviruses by replicating via an RNA intermediate and inserting into a host genome. The <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<i>S. cerevisiae</i>) Ty1-5 elements are long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that are members of the Ty1-<i>copia</i> (<i>Pseudoviridae</i>) or Ty3-<i>gypsy</i> (<i>Metaviridae</i>) families. Four of the five <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Ty elements are inserted into the genome upstream of RNA Polymerase (Pol) III-transcribed genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. This particular genomic locus provides a safe environment for Ty element insertion without disruption of the host genome and is a targeting strategy used by retrotransposons that insert into compact genomes of hosts such as <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i>. The mechanism by which Ty1 targeting is achieved has been recently solved due to the discovery of an interaction between Ty1 Integrase (IN) and RNA Pol III subunits. We describe the methods used to identify the Ty1-IN interaction with Pol III and the Ty1 targeting consequences if the interaction is perturbed. The details of Ty1 targeting are just beginning to emerge and many unexplored areas remain including consideration of the 3-dimensional shape of genome. We present a variety of other retrotransposon families that insert adjacent to Pol III-transcribed genes and the mechanism by which the host machinery has been hijacked to accomplish this targeting strategy. Finally, we discuss why retrotransposons selected Pol III-transcribed genes as a target during evolution and how retrotransposons have shaped genome architecture.",

        "abstract": "Oscillation regulates a wide variety of processes ranging from chemotaxis in Dictyostelium through segmentation in vertebrate development to circadian rhythms. Most studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying oscillation have focused on processes requiring a rhythmic change in gene expression, which usually exhibit a periodicity of >10 min. Mechanisms that control oscillation with shorter periods (<10 min), presumably independent of gene expression changes, are poorly understood. Oscillatory pollen tube tip growth provides an excellent model to investigate such mechanisms. It is well established that ROP1, a Rho-like GTPase from plants, plays an essential role in polarized tip growth in pollen tubes. In this article, we demonstrate that tip-localized ROP1 GTPase activity oscillates in the same frequency with growth oscillation, and leads growth both spatially and temporally. Tip growth requires the coordinate action of two ROP1 downstream pathways that promote the accumulation of tip-localized Ca2+ and actin microfilaments (F-actin), respectively. We show that the ROP1 activity oscillates in a similar phase with the apical F-actin but apparently ahead of tip-localized Ca2+. Furthermore, our observations support the hypothesis that the oscillation of tip-localized ROP activity and ROP-dependent tip growth in pollen tubes is modulated by the two temporally coordinated downstream pathways, an early F-actin assembly pathway and a delayed Ca2+ gradient-forming pathway. To our knowledge, our report is the first to demonstrate the oscillation of Rho GTPase signaling, which may be a common mechanism underlying the oscillation of actin-dependent processes such as polar growth, cell movement, and chemotaxis.",

While genetic studies have discovered important functions for them, the biochemistry behind these roles is often not fully characterized. A key obstacle in inositol phosphate research in mammalian cells has been the lack of straightforward techniques for their purification and analysis. Here we describe the ability of titanium dioxide (TiO2) beads to bind inositol phosphates. This discovery allowed the development of a new purification protocol that, coupled with gel analysis, permitted easy identification and quantification of InsP6 (phytate), its pyrophosphate derivatives InsP7 and InsP8, and the nucleotides ATP and GTP from cell or tissue extracts. Using this approach, InsP6, InsP7 and InsP8 were visualized in Dictyostelium extracts and a variety of mammalian cell lines and tissues, and the effects of metabolic perturbation on these were explored. TiO2 bead purification also enabled us to quantify InsP6 in human plasma and urine, which led to two distinct but related observations. Firstly, there is an active InsP6 phosphatase in human plasma, and secondly, InsP6 is undetectable in either fluid. These observations seriously question reports that InsP6 is present in human biofluids and the advisability of using InsP6 as a dietary supplement.",

Moreover, recent studies have suggested that structures besides lamellipodia, including lamella and filopodia, may have unappreciated roles in cell migration. CP has been postulated to be absent from filopodia, and thus its role in filopodial activity has remained unexplored. We report that silencing CP in both cultured mammalian B16F10 cells and in neurons of developing neocortex impaired cell migration. Moreover, we unexpectedly observed that low levels of CP were detectable in the majority of filopodia. CP depletion decreased filopodial length, altered filopodial shape, and reduced filopodial dynamics. Our results support an expansion of the potential roles that CP plays in cell motility by implicating CP in filopodia as well as in lamellipodia, both of which are important for locomotion in many types of migrating cells.",

Several modifications to the design of the target electrode were tested, and a linear electrode perpendicular to the direction of movement was found to increase the sensitivity and reliability of the assay. Using the optimized ECIS/taxis assay, the dose response of neutrophils and WBC 265-9C cells was established and compared to the Boyden chamber assay.

EPR spectra of BSL-myosin bound to actin in oriented muscle fibers showed sharp three-line spectra, indicating a well-defined orientation relative to the actin filament axis. Spectral analysis indicated that orientation of the spin label can be determined within <2.1\u00b0 accuracy, and comparison with existing structural data in the absence of nucleotide indicates that helix orientation can also be determined with <4.2\u00b0 accuracy.

In these eukaryotic taxa (collectively called Unikonts), autophagy is induced primarily through the Atg1/ULK1 complex in response to nutrient depletion. Autophagy has also been well-studied in non-unikont parasites, such as Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, and found important in their life-cycle transitions. However, how autophagy is induced in non-unikonts remains largely unrevealed. Using a bioinformatics approach, we examined the presence of Atg1 and of its complex in the genomes of 40 non-unikonts. We found that these genomes do not encode typical Atg1 proteins: BLAST and HMMER queries matched only with the kinase domain of Atg1, while other segments responsible for regulation and protein-binding were missing. Non-unikonts also lacked other components of the Atg1-inducing complex. Orthologs of an alternative autophagy inducer, Atg6 were found only in the half of the species, indicating that the other half may possess other inducing mechanisms. As key autophagy genes have differential expression patterns during life-cycle, we raise the possibility that autophagy in these protists is induced mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Understanding Atg1-independent autophagy induction mechanisms in these parasites may lead to novel pharmacological interventions, not affecting human Atg1-dependent autophagy.",

        "abstract": "Cells can use self recognition to achieve cooperative behaviors. Self-recognition genes are thought to principally evolve in tandem with partner self-recognition alleles. However, other constraints on protein evolution could exist. Here, we have identified an interaction outside self-recognition loci that could constrain the sequence variation of a self-recognition protein. We show that during collective swarm expansion in Proteus mirabilis, self-recognition signaling co-opts SdaC, a serine transporter. Serine uptake is crucial for bacterial survival and colonization. Single-residue variants of SdaC reveal that self recognition requires an open conformation of the protein; serine transport is dispensable. A distant ortholog from Escherichia coli is sufficient for self recognition; however, a paralogous serine transporter, YhaO, is not. Thus, SdaC couples self recognition and serine transport, likely through a shared molecular interface. Self-recognition proteins may follow the framework of a complex interaction network rather than an isolated two-protein system. Understanding the molecular and ecological constraints on self-recognition proteins lays the groundwork for insights into the evolution of self recognition and emergent collective behaviors. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteria can receive secret messages from kin during migration. For Proteus mirabilis, these messages are necessary for virulence in multispecies infections. We show that a serine transporter, conserved among gammaproteobacteria, enables self-recognition. Molecular co-option of nutrient uptake could limit the sequence variation of these message proteins. SdaC is the primary transporter for l-serine, a vital metabolite for colonization during disease. Unlike many self-recognition receptors, SdaC is sufficiently conserved between species to achieve recognition. The predicted open conformation is shared by transport and recognition.

        "abstract": "Skp1 is an adapter that links F-box proteins to cullin-1 in the Skp1/cullin-1/F-box (SCF) protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that targets specific proteins for polyubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation. Skp1 from the amoebozoan <i>Dictyostelium</i> forms a stable homodimer <i>in vitro</i> with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 2.5 \u03bcM as determined by sedimentation velocity studies yet is monomeric in crystal complexes with F-box proteins. To investigate the molecular basis for the difference, we determined the solution NMR structure of a doubly truncated Skp1 homodimer (Skp1\u0394\u0394). The solution structure of the Skp1\u0394\u0394 dimer reveals a 2-fold symmetry with an interface that buries \u223c750 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> of predominantly hydrophobic surface. The dimer interface overlaps with subsite 1 of the F-box interaction area, explaining why only the Skp1 monomer binds F-box proteins (FBPs). To confirm the model, Rosetta was used to predict amino acid substitutions that might disrupt the dimer interface, and the F97E substitution was chosen to potentially minimize interference with F-box interactions. A nearly full-length version of Skp1 with this substitution (Skp1\u0394F97E) behaved as a stable monomer at concentrations of \u2264500 \u03bcM and actively bound a model FBP, mammalian Fbs1, which suggests that the dimeric state is not required for Skp1 to carry out a basic biochemical function. Finally, Skp1\u0394F97E is expected to serve as a monomer model for high-resolution NMR studies previously hindered by dimerization.",

        "abstract": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyses the last step in acyl-CoA-dependent triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis and is an important determinant of cellular oil content and quality. In this study, a gene, designated TaDGAT2, encoding a type 2 DGAT (DGAT2)-related enzyme was identified from the oleaginous marine protist Thraustochytrium aureum. The deduced TaDGAT2 sequence contains a ~460 amino acid domain most closely related to DGAT2s from Dictyostelium sp. (45-50% identity). Recombinant TaDGAT2 restored TAG biosynthesis to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae H1246 TAG-deficient mutant, and microsomes from the complemented mutant displayed DGAT activity with C16 and C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglycerol substrates. To examine its biotechnological potential, TaDGAT2 was expressed under control of a strong seed-specific promoter in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and the high linoleic acid fad3fae1 mutant. In both backgrounds, little change was detected in seed oil content, but a striking increase in oleic acid content of seeds was observed. This increase was greatest in fad3fae1 seeds, where relative amounts of oleic acid increased nearly 2-fold to >50% of total fatty acids. In addition, >2-fold increase in oleic acid levels was detected in the triacylglycerol sn-2 position and in the major seed phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that increased seed oleic acid content mediated by TaDGAT2 is influenced in part by the fatty acid composition of host cells and occurs not by enhancing oleic acid content at the TAG sn-3 position directly but by increasing total oleic acid levels in seeds, presumably by limiting flux through phosphatidylcholine-based desaturation reactions.",

        "abstract": "The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a highly regulated fashion is a hallmark of members of the NADPH oxidase (Nox) family of enzymes. Nox enzymes are present in most eukaryotic groups such as the amebozoid, fungi, algae and plants, and animals, in which they are involved in seemingly diverse biological processes. However, a comprehensive survey of Nox functions throughout biology reveals common functional themes. Noxes are often activated in response to stressful conditions such as nutrient starvation, physical damage, or pathogen attack. Although the end result varies depending on the organism and tissue, Nox-produced ROS mediate the response to the adverse stimuli, such as innate immunity responses in plants and animals or cell differentiation in Dictyostelium, fungi, and plants. These responses involve ROS-mediated signaling mechanisms occurring at intracellular or cell-to-cell levels and sometimes involve cell wall or extracellular matrix cross-linking. Indeed, Noxes are involved in local and systemic signaling from plants to fish and in cross-linking of the plant hair-cell wall, synthesis of the nematode cuticle, and formation of the sea urchin fertilization envelope. The extensive use of Nox enzymes in biology to regulate cell-to-cell signaling and morphogenesis suggests that additional functions in mammalian signaling and development remain to be discovered.",

        "abstract": "The cotton bollworm <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> H\u00fcbner (<i>Lepidoptera: Noctuidae</i>) is an important pest of many crops that has developed resistance to almost all groups of insecticides used for its management. Insecticide resistance was often related to Transposable Element (TE) insertions near specific genes. In the present study, we deeply retrieve and annotate TEs in the <i>H. armigera</i> genome using the Pipeline to Retrieve and Annotate Transposable Elements, PiRATE. The results have shown that the TE library consists of 8521 sequences representing 236,132 TE copies, including 3133 Full-Length Copies (FLC), covering 12.86% of the <i>H. armigera</i> genome. These TEs were classified as 46.71% Class I and 53.29% Class II elements. Among Class I elements, Short and Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs and LINEs) are the main families, representing 21.13% and 19.49% of the total TEs, respectively. Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) and Dictyostelium transposable element (DIRS) are less represented, with 5.55% and 0.53%, respectively. Class II elements are mainly Miniature Inverted Transposable Elements (MITEs) (49.11%), then Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) (4.09%). Superfamilies of Class II elements, i.e., Transib, P elements, CACTA, Mutator, PIF-harbinger, Helitron, Maverick, Crypton and Merlin, were less represented, accounting for only 1.96% of total TEs. In addition, we highlighted TE insertions in insecticide resistance genes and we successfully identified nine TE insertions belonging to RTE, R2, CACTA, Mariner and hAT superfamilies. These insertions are hosted in genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CyP450), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter belonging to the G and C1 family members. These insertions could therefore be involved in insecticide resistance observed in this pest.",

        "abstract": "Inositol pyrophosphates are highly energetic inositol polyphosphate molecules present in organisms from slime molds and yeast to mammals. Distinct classes of enzymes generate different forms of inositol pyrophosphates. The biosynthesis of these substances principally involves phosphorylation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP\u2086) to generate the pyrophosphate IP\u2087. Initial insights into functions of these substances derived primarily from yeast, which contain a single isoform of IP\u2086 kinase (yIP\u2086K), as well as from the slime mold Dictyostelium. Mammalian functions for inositol pyrophosphates have been investigated by using cell lines to establish roles in various processes, including insulin secretion and apoptosis. More recently, mice with targeted deletion of IP\u2086K isoforms as well as the related inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) have substantially enhanced our understanding of inositol polyphosphate physiology. Phenotypic alterations in mice lacking inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP\u2086K1) reveal signaling roles for these molecules in insulin homeostasis, obesity, and immunological functions. Inositol pyrophosphates regulate these processes at least in part by inhibiting activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt. Similar studies of IP\u2086K2 establish this enzyme as a cell death inducer acting by stimulating the proapoptotic protein p53. IPMK is responsible for generating the inositol phosphate IP\u2085 but also has phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity--that participates in activation of Akt. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding the physiological functions of the inositol pyrophosphates based in substantial part on studies in mice with deletion of IP\u2086K isoforms. These findings highlight the interplay of IPMK and IP\u2086K in regulating growth factor and nutrient-mediated cell signaling.",

        "abstract": "The means by which a polypeptide chain acquires its unique 3-D structure is a fundamental question in biology. During its synthesis on the ribosome, a nascent chain (NC) emerges vectorially and will begin to fold in a cotranslational fashion. The complex environment of the cell, coupled with the gradual emergence of the ribosome-tethered NC during its synthesis, imposes conformational restraints on its folding landscape that differ from those placed on an isolated protein when stimulated to fold following denaturation in solution. To begin to examine cotranslational folding as it would occur within a cell, we produce highly selective, isotopically labeled NCs bound to isotopically silent ribosomes in vivo. We then apply NMR spectroscopy to study, at a residue specific level, the conformation of NCs consisting of different fractional lengths of the polypeptide chain corresponding to a given protein. This combined approach provides a powerful means of generating a series of snapshots of the folding of the NC as it emerges from the ribosome. Application of this strategy to the NMR analysis of the progressive synthesis of an Ig-like domain reveals the existence of a partially folded ribosome-bound species that is likely to represent an intermediate species populated during the cotranslational folding process.",

        "abstract": "Deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II) is an endonuclease with optimal activity at low pH, localized within the lysosomes of higher eukaryotes. The origin of this enzyme remains in dispute, and its phylogenetic distribution leaves many questions about its subsequent evolutionary history open. Earlier studies have documented its presence in various metazoans, as well as in Dictyostelium, Trichomonas and, anomalously, a single genus of bacteria (Burkholderia). This study makes use of searches of the genomes of various organisms against known DNase II query sequences, in order to determine the likely point of origin of this enzyme among cellular life forms. Its complete absence from any other bacteria makes prokaryotic origin unlikely. Convincing evidence exists for DNase II homologs in Alveolates such as Paramecium, Heterokonts such as diatoms and water molds, and even tentative matches in green algae. Apparent absences include red algae, plants, fungi, and a number of parasitic organisms. Based on this phylogenetic distribution and hypotheses of eukaryotic relationships, the most probable explanation is that DNase II has been subject to multiple losses. The point of origin is debatable, though its presence in Trichomonas and perhaps in other evolutionarily basal \"Excavate\" protists such as Reclinomonas, strongly support the hypothesis that DNase II arose as a plesiomorphic trait in eukaryotes. It probably evolved together with phagocytosis, specifically to facilitate DNA degradation and bacteriotrophy. The various absences in many eukaryotic lineages are accounted for by loss of phagotrophic function in intracellular parasites, in obligate autotrophs, and in saprophytes.",

        "abstract": "In migrating eukaryotic cells, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), filamentous actin (F-actin), and monomeric Rho GTPases are key components of a complex positive-feedback system that maintains and amplifies a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate signal at the leading edge of the cell. This lipid signal is required for cell polarization and movement. In leukocytes and Dictyostelium, activation or inhibition of any one of these components leads to the activation or inhibition, respectively, of the others via undefined feedback interactions. The role of Ca(2+) signals in migrating leukocytes is controversial, and there has been no indication that Ca(2+) participates in positive feedback. Here, we demonstrate that an extracellular Ca(2+) influx is required for positive feedback at the leading edge of spontaneously polarized macrophages. Inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx leads to loss of leading-edge PI3K activity, disassembly of F-actin, cessation of ruffling, and decay of chemoattractant signals. Conversely, increasing cytosolic Ca(2+) enhances membrane ruffling, PI3K activity, and F-actin accumulation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that an extracellular Ca(2+) influx is an essential component, together with PI3K and F-actin, of the positive-feedback cycle that maintains leading-edge structure and ruffling activity and that supports the chemoattractant response. Strikingly, the Ca(2+)-sensitive enzyme protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) is enriched at the leading edge, and its enrichment is sensitive to blockade of Ca(2+) influx, to inhibition of PI3K activity, and to F-actin depolymerization. These findings support the working hypothesis that a local, leading-edge Ca(2+) signal recruits PKCalpha as a central player in the positive-feedback loop.",

        "abstract": "Studies of online database(s) showed that convincing examples of eukaryote PPKs derived from bacteria type PPK1 and PPK2 enzymes are rare and currently confined to a few simple eukaryotes. These enzymes probably represent several separate horizontal transfer events. Retention of such sequences may be an advantage for tolerance to stresses such as desiccation or nutrient depletion for simple eukaryotes that lack more sophisticated adaptations available to multicellular organisms. We propose that the acquisition of encoding sequences for these enzymes by horizontal transfer enhanced the ability of early plants to colonise the land. The improved ability to sequester and release inorganic phosphate for carbon fixation by photosynthetic algae in the ocean may have accelerated or even triggered global glaciation events. There is some evidence for DNA sequences encoding PPKs in a wider range of eukaryotes, notably some invertebrates, though it is unclear that these represent functional genes.Polyphosphate (poly P) is found in all cells, carrying out a wide range of essential roles. Studied mainly in prokaryotes, the enzymes responsible for synthesis of poly P in eukaryotes (polyphosphate kinases PPKs) are not well understood. The best characterised enzyme from bacteria known to catalyse the formation of high molecular weight polyphosphate from ATP is PPK1 which shows some structural similarity to phospholipase D. A second bacterial PPK (PPK2) resembles thymidylate kinase. Recent reports have suggested a widespread distribution of these bacteria type enzymes in eukaryotes.",

They are composed of a large N-terminal motor domain with ATPase and actin binding sites and C-terminal neck and tail regions, whose functional roles and structural context in the protein are less well characterized. The tail regions of myosins I, IV, VII, XII, and XV each contain a putative SH3 domain that may be involved in protein-protein interactions. SH3 domains are reported to bind proline-rich motifs, especially \"PxxP\" sequences, and such interactions serve regulatory functions. The activity of Src, PI3, and Itk kinases, for example, is regulated by intramolecular interactions between their SH3 domain and internal proline-rich sequences. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to reveal the structure of a protein construct from Dictyostelium myosin VII (DdM7) spanning A1620-T1706, which contains its SH3 domain and adjacent proline-rich region. The SH3 domain forms the signature beta-barrel architecture found in other SH3 domains, with conserved tryptophan and tyrosine residues forming a hydrophobic pocket known to bind \"PxxP\" motifs. In addition, acidic residues in the RT or n-Src loops are available to interact with the basic anchoring residues that are typically found in ligands or proteins that bind SH3 domains. The DdM7 SH3 differs in the hydrophobicity of the second pocket formed by the 3(10) helix and following beta-strand, which contains polar rather than hydrophobic side chains. Most unusual, however, is that this domain binds its adjacent proline-rich region at a surface remote from the region previously identified to bind \"PxxP\" motifs. The interaction may affect the orientation of the tail without sacrificing the availability of the canonical \"PxxP\"-binding surface.",

Here, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of cross-sectional positron emission tomography and single-photon emission-computed tomography studies on the average effects of age on distinct DA targets (receptors, transporters, or relevant enzymes) in healthy adults (N\u00a0= 95 studies including 2611 participants). Results revealed significant moderate to large, negative effects of age on DA transporters and receptors. Age had a significantly larger effect on D1- than D2-like receptors. In contrast, there was no significant effect of age on DA synthesis capacity. The average age reductions across the DA system were 3.7%-14.0% per decade. A meta-regression found only DA target as a significant moderator of the age effect. This study precisely quantifies prior claims of reduced DA functionality with age. It also identifies presynaptic mechanisms (spared synthesis capacity and reduced DA transporters) that may partially account for previously unexplained phenomena whereby older adults appear to use dopaminergic resources effectively.

        "abstract": "In cell division, cytokinesis is tightly coupled with mitosis to maintain genomic integrity. Failed cytokinesis in humans can result in tetraploid cells that can become aneuploid and promote cancer. However, the likelihood of aneuploidy and cancer after a failed cytokinesis event is unknown. Here we evaluated cell fate after failed cytokinesis. We interrupted cytokinesis by brief chemical treatments in cell populations of human epithelial lines. Surprisingly, up to 50% of the resulting binucleate cells generated colonies. In RPE1 cells, 90% of colonies obtained from binucleate founders had a karyotype that matched the parental cell type. Time-lapse videomicroscopy demonstrated that binucleate cells are delayed in the first growth phase of the cell cycle (G1) and undergo interphase cellular fission (cytofission) that distributes nuclei into separate daughters. The fission is not compatible with delayed cytokinesis because events occur in the absence of polymerized microtubules and without canonical components of the cytokinetic machinery. However, the cytofission can be interrupted by inhibiting function of actin or myosin II. Fission events occur in both two- and three-dimensional culture. Our data demonstrate that cytofission can preserve genomic integrity after failed cytokinesis. Thus, traction-mediated cytofission, originally observed in Dictyostelium, is relevant to human biology--where it seems to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that can preserve genomic integrity.",

        "abstract": "The Arp2/3 complex generates branched actin networks that exert pushing forces onto different cellular membranes. WASH complexes activate Arp2/3 complexes at the surface of endosomes and thereby fission transport intermediates containing endocytosed receptors, such as \u03b15\u03b21 integrins. How WASH complexes are assembled in the cell is unknown. Here, we identify the small coiled-coil protein HSBP1 as a factor that specifically promotes the assembly of a ternary complex composed of CCDC53, WASH, and FAM21 by dissociating the CCDC53 homotrimeric precursor. HSBP1 operates at the centrosome, which concentrates the building blocks. HSBP1 depletion in human cancer cell lines and in <i>Dictyostelium</i> amoebae phenocopies WASH depletion, suggesting a critical role of the ternary WASH complex for WASH functions. HSBP1 is required for the development of focal adhesions and of cell polarity. These defects impair the migration and invasion of tumor cells. Overexpression of HSBP1 in breast tumors is associated with increased levels of WASH complexes and with poor prognosis for patients.",

We find that EGFR activates the Hippo pathway transcription factor Yorkie and demonstrate that Yorkie is required for the influence of EGFR on cell proliferation in Drosophila. EGFR regulates Yorkie through the influence of its Ras-MAPK branch on the Ajuba LIM protein Jub. Jub is epistatic to EGFR and Ras for Yorkie regulation, Jub is subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, and EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling enhances Jub binding to the Yorkie kinase Warts and the adaptor protein Salvador. An EGFR-Hippo pathway link is conserved in mammals, as activation of EGFR or RAS activates the Yorkie homolog YAP, and EGFR-RAS-MAPK signaling promotes phosphorylation of the Ajuba family protein WTIP and also enhances WTIP binding to the Warts and Salvador homologs LATS and WW45. Our observations implicate the Hippo pathway in EGFR-mediated tumorigenesis and identify a molecular link between these pathways.",

They harbor an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (FZ-CRD), a mobile evolutionary unit that has been found in a number of other metazoan proteins and Frizzled-like proteins in Dictyostelium. Domains distantly related to FZ-CRDs, in Hedgehog-interacting proteins (HHIPs), folate receptors and riboflavin-binding proteins (FRBPs), and Niemann-Pick Type C1 proteins (NPC1s), referred to as HFN-CRDs, exhibit similar structures and disulfide connectivity patterns compared with FZ-CRDs. We used computational analyses to expand the homologous set of FZ-CRDs and HFN-CRDs, providing a better understanding of their evolution and classification. First, FZ-CRD-containing proteins with various domain compositions were identified in several major eukaryotic lineages including plants and Chromalveolata, revealing a wider phylogenetic distribution of FZ-CRDs than previously recognized. Second, two new and distinct groups of highly divergent FZ-CRDs were found by sensitive similarity searches. One of them is present in the calcium channel component Mid1 in fungi and the uncharacterized FAM155 proteins in metazoans. Members of the other new FZ-CRD group occur in the metazoan-specific RECK (reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs) proteins that are putative tumor suppressors acting as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. Finally, sequence and three-dimensional structural comparisons helped us uncover a divergent HFN-CRD in glypicans, which are important morphogen-binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Such a finding reinforces the evolutionary ties between the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways and underscores the importance of gene duplications in creating essential signaling components in metazoan evolution.",

Skp1 in Dictyostelium is posttranslationally modified on a specific hydroxyproline (Hyp) residue by a pentasaccharide, which consists of a Fuc\u03b11,2-Gal\u03b2-1,3-GlcNAc\u03b1 core, decorated with two \u03b1-linked Gal residues. A glycopeptide derived form Skp1 was prepared to characterize the \u03b1-galactosyltransferase (AgtA) that mediates the addition of the \u03b1-Gal moieties, and to develop antibodies suitable for tracking the trisaccharide isoform of Skp1 in cells. A strategy was developed for the synthesis of the core trisaccharide-Hyp based on the use of 2-naphthylmethyl (Nap) ethers as permanent protecting groups to allow late stage installation of the Hyp moiety. Tuning of glycosyl donor and acceptor reactivities was critical for achieving high yields and anomeric selectivities of glycosylations. The trisaccharide-Hyp moiety was employed for the preparation of the glycopeptide using microwave-assisted solid phase peptide synthesis. Enzyme kinetic studies revealed that trisaccharide-Hyp and trisaccharide-peptide are poorly recognized by AgtA, indicating the importance of context provided by the native Skp1 protein for engagement with the active site. The trisaccharide-peptide was a potent immunogen capable of generating a rabbit antiserum that was highly selective toward the trisaccharide isoform of full-length Skp1.",

        "abstract": "Sensing of an electric field (EF) by cells-galvanotaxis-is important in wound healing [1], development [2], cell division, nerve growth, and angiogenesis [3]. Different cell types migrate in opposite directions in EFs [4], and the same cell can switch the directionality depending on conditions [5]. A tug-of-war mechanism between multiple signaling pathways [6] can direct Dictyostelium cells to either cathode or anode. Mechanics of motility is simplest in fish keratocytes, so we turned to keratocytes to investigate their migration in EFs. Keratocytes sense electric fields and migrate to the cathode [7, 8]. Keratocyte fragments [9, 10] are the simplest motile units. Cell fragments from leukocytes are able to respond to chemotactic signals [11], but whether cell fragments are galvanotactic was unknown. We found that keratocyte fragments are the smallest motile electric field-sensing unit: they migrate to the anode, in the opposite direction of whole cells. Myosin II was essential for the direction sensing of fragments but not for parental cells, while PI3 kinase was essential for the direction sensing of whole cells but not for fragments. Thus, two signal transduction pathways, one depending on PI3K, another on myosin, compete to orient motile cells in the electric field. Galvanotaxis is not due to EF force and does not depend on cell or fragment size. We propose a \"compass\" model according to which protrusive and contractile actomyosin networks self-polarize to the front and rear of the motile cell, respectively, and the electric signal orients both networks toward cathode with different strengths.",

We provide evidence that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can stimulate PLCb2/b3 and diacylglycerol- dependent activation of the RasGEF, RasGRP4 in neutrophils. The genetic loss of RasGRP4 phenocopies knock-in of a Ras-insensitive version of PI3Kc in its effects on PI3Kc-dependent PIP3 accumulation, PKB activation, chemokinesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation.

We surveyed 6,499 B. thuringiensis isolates by hybridization for sequences related to cry35A genes, identifying 78 strains. Proteins of the appropriate molecular mass (ca. 44 kDa) for Cry35 were observed in 42 of the strains. Full-length, or nearly full-length, sequences of 34 cry34 genes and 16 cry35 genes were also obtained from cloning, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing. These included representatives of all known Cry34A, Cry34B, Cry35A, and Cry35B classes, as well as a novel Cry34A/Cry35A-like pair. Bioassay analysis indicated that cry35-hybridizing strains not producing a ca. 14-kDa protein, indicative of Cry34, were not active on corn rootworms, and that the previously identified Cry34A/Cry35A pairs were more active than the Cry34B/Cry35B pairs. The cry35-hybridizing B. thuringiensis strains were found in locales and materials typical for other B. thuringiensis strains. Comparison of the sequences with the geographic origins of the strains showed that identical, or nearly identical, sequences were found in strains from both Australasia and the Americas. Sequence similarity searches revealed that Cry34 proteins are similar to predicted proteins in Photorhabdus luminescens and Dictyostelium discoidium, and that Cry35Ab1 contains a segment similar to beta-trefoil domains that may be a binding motif. The binary Cry34/Cry35 B. thuringiensis crystal proteins thus appear closely related to each other, are environmentally ubiquitous, and share sequence similarities consistent with activity through membrane disruption in target organisms.",

        "abstract": "The plasma membrane is widely regarded as the hub of the signal transduction network activities that drives numerous physiological responses, including cell polarity and migration. Yet, the symmetry breaking process in the membrane, that leads to dynamic compartmentalization of different proteins, remains poorly understood. Using multimodal live-cell imaging, here we first show that multiple endogenous and synthetic lipid-anchored proteins, despite maintaining stable tight association with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, were unexpectedly depleted from the membrane domains where the signaling network was spontaneously activated such as in the new protrusions as well as within the propagating ventral waves. Although their asymmetric patterns resembled those of standard peripheral \"back\" proteins such as PTEN, unlike the latter, these lipidated proteins did not dissociate from the membrane upon global receptor activation. Our experiments not only discounted the possibility of recurrent reversible translocation from membrane to cytosol as it occurs for weakly bound peripheral membrane proteins, but also ruled out the necessity of directed vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal supramolecular structure-based restrictions in driving these dynamic symmetry breaking events. Selective photoconversion-based protein tracking assays suggested that these asymmetric patterns instead originate from the inherent ability of these membrane proteins to \"dynamically partition\" into distinct domains within the plane of the membrane. Consistently, single-molecule measurements showed that these lipid-anchored molecules have substantially dissimilar diffusion profiles in different regions of the membrane. When these profiles were incorporated into an excitable network-based stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the system, simulations revealed that our proposed \"dynamic partitioning\" mechanism is sufficient to give rise to familiar asymmetric propagating wave patterns. Moreover, we demonstrated that normally uniform integral and lipid-anchored membrane proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian neutrophil cells can be induced to partition spatiotemporally to form polarized patterns, by optogenetically recruiting membrane domain-specific peptides to these proteins. Together, our results indicate \"dynamic partitioning\" as a new mechanism of plasma membrane organization, that can account for large-scale compartmentalization of a wide array of lipid-anchored and integral membrane proteins in different physiological processes.",

        "title": "Measurement of cellular chemotaxis with ECIS/Taxis.",
        "abstract": "Cellular movement in response to external stimuli is fundamental to many cellular processes including wound healing, inflammation and the response to infection. A common method to measure chemotaxis is the Boyden chamber assay, in which cells and chemoattractant are separated by a porous membrane. As cells migrate through the membrane toward the chemoattractant, they adhere to the underside of the membrane, or fall into the underlying media, and are subsequently stained and visually counted (1). In this method, cells are exposed to a steep and transient chemoattractant gradient, which is thought to be a poor representation of gradients found in tissues (2). Another assay system, the under-agarose chemotaxis assay, (3, 4) measures cell movement across a solid substrate in a thin aqueous film that forms under the agarose layer. The gradient that develops in the agarose is shallow and is thought to be an appropriate representation of naturally occurring gradients. Chemotaxis can be evaluated by microscopic imaging of the distance traveled. Both the Boyden chamber assay and the under-agarose assay are usually configured as endpoint assays. The automated ECIS/Taxis system combines the under-agarose approach with Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) (5, 6). In this assay, target electrodes are located in each of 8 chambers. A large counter-electrode runs through each of the 8 chambers (Figure 2). Each chamber is filled with agarose and two small wells are the cut in the agarose on either side of the target electrode. One well is filled with the test cell population, while the other holds the sources of diffusing chemoattractant (Figure 3). Current passed through the system can be used to determine the change in resistance that occurs as cells pass over the target electrode. Cells on the target electrode increase the resistance of the system (6). In addition, rapid fluctuations in the resistance represent changes in the interactions of cells with the electrode surface and are indicative of ongoing cellular shape changes. The ECIS/Taxis system can measure movement of the cell population in real-time over extended periods of time, but is also sensitive enough to detect the arrival of a single cell at the target electrode. Dictyostelium discoidium is known to migrate in the presence of a folate gradient (7, 8) and its chemotactic response can be accurately measured by ECIS/Taxis (9). Leukocyte chemotaxis, in response to SDF1\u03b1 and to chemotaxis antagonists has also been measured with ECIS/Taxis (10, 11). An example of the leukocyte response to SDF1\u03b1 is shown in Figure 1.",

        "abstract": "We examined the magnesium dependence of five class II myosins, including fast skeletal muscle myosin, smooth muscle myosin, \u03b2-cardiac myosin (CMIIB), Dictyostelium myosin II (DdMII), and nonmuscle myosin IIA, as well as myosin V. We found that the myosins examined are inhibited in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner (0.3-9.0 mm free Mg(2+)) in both ATPase and motility assays, under conditions in which the ionic strength was held constant. We found that the ADP release rate constant is reduced by Mg(2+) in myosin V, smooth muscle myosin, nonmuscle myosin IIA, CMIIB, and DdMII, although the ADP affinity is fairly insensitive to Mg(2+) in fast skeletal muscle myosin, CMIIB, and DdMII. Single tryptophan probes in the switch I (Trp-239) and switch II (Trp-501) region of DdMII demonstrate these conserved regions of the active site are sensitive to Mg(2+) coordination. Cardiac muscle fiber mechanic studies demonstrate cross-bridge attachment time is increased at higher Mg(2+) concentrations, demonstrating that the ADP release rate constant is slowed by Mg(2+) in the context of an activated muscle fiber. Direct measurements of phosphate release in myosin V demonstrate that Mg(2+) reduces actin affinity in the M\u00b7ADP\u00b7Pi state, although it does not change the rate of phosphate release. Therefore, the Mg(2+) inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity observed in class II myosins is likely the result of Mg(2+)-dependent alterations in actin binding. Overall, our results suggest that Mg(2+) reduces the ADP release rate constant and rate of attachment to actin in both high and low duty ratio myosins.",

These four genes have a limited distribution among sequenced prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and were previously implicated in gene transfer events affecting eukaryotes. If our previous contention that these genes were introduced by LGT independently into the diplomonad and Entamoeba lineages were true, we expect that the number of putative transfers and the phylogenetic signal supporting LGT should be stable or increase, rather than decrease, when novel eukaryotic and prokaryotic homologs are added to the analyses.",

        "abstract": "Regulation of cellular actin dynamics is pivotal in driving cell motility. During cancer development, cells migrate to invade and spread; therefore, dysregulation of actin regulators is often associated with cancer progression. Here we report the role of ABRACL, a human homolog of the <i>Dictyostelium</i> actin regulator Costars, in migration and tumorigenic growth of cancer cells. We found a correlation between ABRACL expression and the migratory ability of cancer cells. Cell staining revealed the colocalization of ABRACL and F-actin signals at the leading edge of migrating cells. Analysis of the relative F-/G-actin contents in cells lacking or overexpressing ABRACL suggested that ABRACL promotes cellular actin distribution to the polymerized fraction. Physical interaction between ABRACL and cofilin was supported by immunofluorescence staining and proximity ligation. Additionally, ABRACL hindered cofilin-simulated pyrene F-actin fluorescence decay in vitro, indicating a functional interplay. Lastly, analysis on a colorectal cancer cohort demonstrated that high ABRACL expression was associated with distant metastasis, and further exploration showed that depletion of ABRACL expression in colon cancer cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and tumorigenic growth. Together, results suggest that ABRACL modulates actin dynamics through its interaction with cofilin and thereby regulates cancer cell migration and participates in cancer pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular calcium-permeable channels have been implicated in thermogenic function of murine brown and brite/beige adipocytes, respectively transient receptor potential melastin-8 and transient receptor potential vanilloid-4. Because the endo-lysosomal two-pore channels (TPCs) have also been ascribed with metabolic functionality, we studied the effect of simultaneously knocking out TPC1 and TPC2 on body composition and energy balance in male mice fed a chow diet. Compared with wild-type mice, TPC1 and TPC2 double knockout (Tpcn1/2(-/-)) animals had a higher respiratory quotient and became obese between 6 and 9 months of age. Although food intake was unaltered, interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) maximal temperature and lean-mass adjusted oxygen consumption were lower in Tpcn1/2(-/-) than in wild type mice. Phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase expression, lipid density and expression of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors were also lower in Tpcn1/2(-/-) BAT, whereas mitochondrial respiratory chain function and uncoupling protein-1 expression remained intact. We conclude that Tpcn1/2(-/-) mice show mature-onset obesity due to reduced lipid availability and use, and a defect in \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling, leading to impaired thermogenic activity, in BAT.",

The mTORC2 signaling complex functions as the regulatory kinase of the distinct members of AGC kinase family known to regulate cell proliferation and survival. In the early chemotaxis studies in Dictyostelium, the rictor's ortholog has been identified as a regulator of cell migration. How rictor regulates cell migration is poorly characterized. Here we show that rictor regulates cell migration by controlling a potent inhibitor of Rho proteins known as the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2). On the basis of on our proteomics study we identified that the rictor-dependent deficiency in cell migration is caused by upregulation of RhoGDI2 leading to a low activity of Rac and Cdc42. We found that a suppression of RhoGDI2 by rictor is not related to the Sin1 or raptor function that excludes a role of mTORC2 or mTORC1 in regulation of RhoGDI2. Our study reveals that rictor by suppressing RhoGDI2 promotes activity of the Rho proteins and cell migration.",

        "abstract": "The cytoplasmic functions of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family (WAS) proteins are well established and include roles in cytoskeleton reorganization and membrane-cytoskeletal interactions important for membrane/vesicle trafficking, morphogenesis, immune response, and signal transduction. Misregulation of these proteins is associated with immune deficiency and metastasis [1-4]. Cytoplasmic WAS proteins act as effectors of Rho family GTPases and polymerize branched actin through the Arp2/3 complex [1, 5]. Previously, we identified Drosophila washout (wash) as a new member of the WAS family with essential cytoplasmic roles in early development [6, 7]. Studies in mammalian cells and Dictyostelium suggest that WASH functions primarily in a multiprotein complex that regulates endosome shape and trafficking in an Arp2/3-dependent manner [8-11]. However, roles for classically cytoplasmic proteins in the nucleus are beginning to emerge, in particular, as participants in the regulation of gene expression [12, 13]. Here, we show that Drosophila Wash is present in the nucleus, where it plays a key role in global nuclear organization. wash mutant and knockdown nuclei disrupt subnuclear structures/organelles and exhibit the abnormal wrinkled morphology reminiscent of those observed in diverse laminopathies [14-16]. We find that nuclear Wash interacts with B-type Lamin (Lamin Dm0), and, like Lamin, Wash associates with constitutive heterochromatin. Wash knockdown increases chromatin accessibility of repressive compartments and results in a global redistribution of repressive histone modifications. Thus, our results reveal a novel role for Wash in modulating nucleus morphology and in the organization of both chromatin and non-chromatin nuclear sub-structures.",

        "abstract": "The tubular growth of a pollen tube cell is crucial for the sexual reproduction of flowering plants. LePRK1 is a pollen-specific and plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). LePRK1 interacts with another receptor, LePRK2, and with KINASE PARTNER PROTEIN (KPP), a Rop guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Here, we show that pollen tubes overexpressing LePRK1 or a truncated LePRK1 lacking its extracellular domain (LePRK1\u0394ECD) have enlarged tips but also extend their leading edges by producing \"blebs.\" Coexpression of LePRK1 and tomato PLIM2a, an actin bundling protein that interacts with KPP in a Ca(2+)-responsive manner, suppressed these LePRK1 overexpression phenotypes, whereas pollen tubes coexpressing KPP, LePRK1, and PLIM2a resumed the blebbing growth mode. We conclude that overexpression of LePRK1 or LePRK1\u0394ECD rewires pollen tube growth to a blebbing mode, through KPP- and PLIM2a-mediated bundling of actin filaments from tip plasma membranes. Arabidopsis thaliana pollen tubes expressing LePRK1\u0394ECD also grew by blebbing. Our results exposed a hidden capability of the pollen tube cell: upon overexpression of a single membrane-localized molecule, LePRK1 or LePRK1\u0394ECD, it can switch to an alternative mechanism for extension of the leading edge that is analogous to the blebbing growth mode reported for Dictyostelium and for Drosophila melanogaster stem cells.",

A UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase glucosylates N-glycans of misfolded proteins, which are then bound and refolded by calreticulin and/or calnexin in association with a protein disulfide isomerase. Alternatively, an alpha-1,2-mannosidase (Mns1) and mannosidase-like proteins (ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like proteins 1, 2, and 3) are part of a process that results in the dislocation of misfolded glycoproteins into the cytosol, where proteins are degraded in the proteasome. Recently we found that numerous protists and fungi contain 0-11 sugars in their N-glycan precursors versus 14 sugars in those of animals, plants, fungi, and Dictyostelium. Our goal here was to determine what effect N-glycan precursor diversity has on N-glycan-dependent QC systems of glycoprotein folding and ERAD. N-glycan-dependent QC of folding (UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, calreticulin, and/or calnexin) was present and active in some but not all protists containing at least five mannose residues in their N-glycans and was absent in protists lacking Man. In contrast, N-glycan-dependent ERAD appeared to be absent from the majority of protists. However, Trypanosoma and Trichomonas genomes predicted ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein and Mns1 orthologs, respectively, each of which had alpha-mannosidase activity in vitro. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the diversity of N-glycan-dependent QC of glycoprotein folding (and possibly that of ERAD) was best explained by secondary loss. We conclude that N-glycan precursor length has profound effects on N-glycan-dependent QC of glycoprotein folding and ERAD.",

        "title": "Differentiation-inducing factor-1 suppresses cyclin D1-induced cell proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inhibiting S6K-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 synthesis.",
        "abstract": "Differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of various mammalian cells by unknown means, although some possible mechanisms of its action have been proposed, including the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Here, we report an alternative mechanism underlying the action of DIF-1 in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, on which the effects of DIF-1 have not been examined previously. Intragastric administration of DIF-1 reduced the tumor growth from MCF-7 cells injected into a mammary fat pad of nude mice, without causing adverse effects. In cultured MCF-7, DIF-1 arrested the cell cycle in G<sub>0</sub> /G<sub>1</sub> phase and suppressed cyclin D1 expression, consistent with our previous results obtained in other cell species. However, DIF-1 did not inhibit the phosphorylation of GSK-3. Investigating an alternative mechanism for the reduction of cyclin D1, we found that DIF-1 reduced the protein levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 suppressed cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation and the overexpression of STAT3 enhanced cyclin D1 expression and accelerated proliferation. Differentiation-inducing factor-1 did not reduce STAT3 mRNA or reduce STAT3 protein in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that DIF-1 inhibited STAT3 protein synthesis. Seeking its mechanism, we revealed that DIF-1 inhibited the activation of 70\u00a0kDa and/or 85\u00a0kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70<sup>S6K</sup> /p85<sup>S6K</sup> ). Inhibition of p70<sup>S6K</sup> /p85<sup>S6K</sup> by rapamycin also reduced the expressions of STAT3 and cyclin D1. Therefore, DIF-1 suppresses MCF-7 proliferation by inhibiting p70<sup>S6K</sup> /p85<sup>S6K</sup> activity and STAT3 protein synthesis followed by reduction of cyclin D1 expression.",

        "title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.",
        "abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.",
