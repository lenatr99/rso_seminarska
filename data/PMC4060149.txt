Okay Methods in molecular biology Author Manuscript HHS Public Access N-Glycomic and -Glycoproteomic Studies in the Social Amoebae Christa L. Feasley, Alba Hykollari,, and Christopher M. West Additional article information Summary N-glycans modify the great majority of all secreted and plasma membrane proteins, which themselves constitute one-third to one-half of the proteome. The ultimate definition of the glycoproteome would be the identification of all the N-glycans attached to all the modified asparaginyl sites of all the proteins, but glycosylation heterogeneity makes this an unachievable goal. However, mass spectrometry in combination with other methods does have the power to deeply mine the N-glycome of Dictyostelium, and characterize glycan profiles at individual sites of glycoproteins. Recent studies from our laboratories using mass spectrometry-based methods have confirmed basic precepts of the N-glycome based on prior classical methods using radiotracer methods, and have extended the scope of glycan diversity and the distribution of glycan types across specific glycoprotein attachment sites. The protocols described here simplify studies of the N-glycome and -glycoproteome, which should prove useful for interpreting mutant phenotypes, conducting interstrain and interspecies comparisons, and investigating glycan functions in glycoproteins of interest. Keywords: Dictyostelium, glycosylation, glycome, glycoproteome, mass spectrometry, phosphoglycans, sulfated glycans 1. Introduction The many attractions for studying the social soil amoebae include their amoebal lifestyle and multicellular developmental cycle elicited by starvation, and their tractability for molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell biology. In development, the amoebae chemotactically assemble a migrating slug which, in response to appropriate environmental signals, emerges from the soil to culminate into a fruiting body whose aerial spores can be dispersed to new locations. The amoebae are surrounded by a rich glycocalyx whose glycan composition changes in concert with the developmental cycle. Dictyostelium discoideum, like most other eukaryotes, carries out extensive N-glycosylation of its membrane and secreted proteins. During protein translocation into the rER, Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 - is transferred from the canonical lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor by oligosaccharyltransferase to the amide of an Asn residing in an N-sequon consisting of Asn-x-Ser/Thr. As described in other organisms, removal of the peripheral glucose and certain peripheral mannose residues are likely to be involved in ERQC and ERAD pathways that contribute to nascent protein folding and complex assembly, and consequential dislocation of unfolded proteins into the cytoplasm. Subsequent remodeling of the N-glycans produces a spectrum of N-glycans that contribute to post rER functions in the life of the carrier protein. Early studies suggested that the types of N- and O-glycans formed are developmentally regulated based on studies with lectins including wheat germ agglutinin and Concanavalin A, and anticarbohydrate monoclonal antibodies. Subsequently, metabolic labeling with 3 H-sugars, 35 SO 4, and 32 PO 4, coupled with chromatographic methods, exoglycosidase treatments and NMR, indicated that the N-glycome is dominated by high-mannose structures with variable processing and a variety of substitutions including CH 3 -PO 4 - and SO 4 - on peripheral Man residues, βGlcNAc at bisecting and intersecting positions, and core α-fucosylation. Developmental progression was accompanied by increased Man-trimming with decreased or increased peripheral modifications. Genetic analyses have implicated several genes responsible for precursor assembly and specific processing steps. Genomic searches identified 77 candidate glycosyltransferase and glycophosphotransferase genes, and many glycosidase genes, that are expected to contribute to the assembly and remodeling of the N- and other types of glycans. This enumeration implies that structural heterogeneity is greater than could be resolved by previous chromatographic methods. Recent studies using mass spectrometry and other high-resolution methods have re-investigated the overall N-glycomes of total cells and a single cell surface glycoprotein gp130 implicated in cell adhesion. The basic findings of the classical studies have been confirmed and, not surprisingly, the detailed diversity of the N-glycome has been considerably expanded. Studies of other social amoebae are beginning to reveal substantial differences in peripheral processing of the high-mannose structures. Interestingly, glycoproteomic studies of the heavily N-glycosylated gp130 revealed that nearly the entire diversity of the N-glycome is expressed on this single cell surface glycophosphatidylinositol -anchored protein. The application of mass spectrometry and complementary strategies for defining the N-glycome and site-specific representation on glycoproteins is the subject of this article. We describe how to characterize the dolichol-PP-glycan precursor, and alternative methods for enzymatically liberating and recovering different N-glycan classes from glycoproteins. An overview is presented in the flow chart in Fig. 1. Methods for MS profiling of the native N-glycans themselves or after conjugation via their reducing ends to fluorophores or permethylation are then described. Though MS methods are excellent at determining glycan compositions based on proportions of hexoses, HexNAcs, deoxyhexoses, etc., additional approaches are required to determine sugar identities and linkage types. Fortunately, so-called biosynthetic rules based on prior studies, and MS-MS fragmentation methods, can frequently permit accurate predictions of structural models for N-glycans in Dictyostelium and additional methods that assist in these determinations are included. Orthogonal separation and enrichment strategies to resolve glycan subclasses, including normal and reversed phase and ionic exchange methods, as well as the use of anticarbohydrate antibodies to differentiate core α1,3-fucosylation, are also described. Finally, we show how modifications of the approaches can be applied to analysis of glycans prior to release from their Asn anchors, i.e., as glycopeptides, in order to map their locations on proteins.

MALDI-TOF and TOF-TOF Analysis Dry native or derivatized samples completely under vacuum centrifugation and resuspend in 20 µL of 50% ACN. Prepare a method blank identically to experimental samples to differentiate signals from background contamination. Spot 0.5 µL of the sample onto a polished steel MALDI target plate with an equal volume of DHB MALDI matrix and vacuum dry for co-crystallization. Anionic glycans are routinely screened also using THAP or ATT matrices. Spot a dextran ladder as an external mass calibrant. Analyze glycans in an Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF-TOF in reflectron positive ion mode with an accelerating voltage of 23 kV, or negative ion mode for anionic glycans. Acquire MALDI spectra at laser frequency of 66 Hz and sum 1000–2000 individual spectra or each sample. Precursor ions are accelerated to 8 kV and selected by a timed ion gate. For glycan fragmentation, perform TOF-TOF MS/MS experiments by accelerating fragment ions generated by laser-induced dissociation at 19 kV using the incorporated LIFT™ device in Bruker Ultraflex instruments. High energy collision-induced decay is performed using Ar as the collision gas; alternatively, laser-induced dissociation can also be performed. 3.11. Glycan Data Analysis Analyze MS spectra using flexAnalysis software. Ions are typically singly charged under the MALDI conditions described, and exact monoisotopic m/z values should be examined. Select either + or + ions for peak picking in positive ion mode, or − in negative ion mode. For anionic native glycans, variations occur as shown in Fig. 2B–F. Predict glycan compositions based on mass/charge matching with potential glycan compositions using manual calculations or GlycoWorkbench software. Typical parameters are as follows: must match +/− 0.3 daltons and contain Hex, HexNAc, deoxyHex, sulfate, methylphosphate. Apply corrections for reducing terminal derivatization or permethylation. Prior studies of Dictyostelium N-glycans indicate that Hex=Man, HexNAc=GlcNAc, and deoxyHex=Fuc. Examples of native and pyridylaminated species in standard positive ion mode are shown in Fig. 2A, G. Other panels show variations on the method that permit detection of anionic glycans, which are more difficult to detect under standard conditions. The different approaches selectively emphasize the abundance of sulfated or methylphosphorylated N-glycans, which illustrates a challenge for sample preparation and MS that has yet to be resolved. See Note 17 for samples that contain a background of poly-Hex species. Predict structural models based on known biosynthetic rules, and confirm using exoglycosidase digestions, chemical cleavage, and MS/MS studies. These models can be converged with findings from elution times in 2-D HPLC studies. Estimate relative abundance in permethylated samples by dividing the ion abundance for individual glycans by the total ion abundance of all identified N-glycans. 3.12. Glycopeptide Enrichment Generate tryptic glycopeptides as in Subheading 3.3.1, steps 1–5, except use sequencing grade trypsin. Glycopeptides from proteolytic digests can then be enriched by HILIC or by lectin ConA selection. 3.12.1. Option 1: HILIC Pre-equilibrate polyHYDROXYETHYL A TopTips with loading buffer. Resuspend lyophilized peptides in 10 µL of loading buffer, and gently apply to the upper surface of the TopTip. Wash out unbound peptides with 5 column volumes of loading buffer. Elute glycopeptides with 3 column volumes of 0.5% formic acid and dry in vacuo. 3.12.2. Option 2: ConA Dissolve peptides in 100 µL of ConA binding buffer and incubate with 200 µL of ConA agarose beads in a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube for 1 h at 22°C with rocking. Transfer the slurry to a Bio-Rad Bio-spin column, and elute non-glycosylated peptides with 10 bed volumes of ConA binding buffer. Elute glycopeptides with 3 bed volumes of 0.2 M α-methyl mannoside in ConA binding buffer, and desalt on a C 18 -SepPak as above. 3.13. MS Analysis of Glycopeptides 3.13.1. Option 1: MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS Spot the samples with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution and vacuum dry. Spot a seven-component peptide mixture as an external mass calibrant. 3.13.2. Option 2: nanoLC-MS/MS Load 2 µg of total trypsin digest onto a pre-equilibrated PepMap100 C 18 column, and elute, at a flow rate of 200 nL/min over a period of 40 min, with a linear gradient of 10–70% of a buffer made of 0.09% formic acid, 0.0085% TFA, 95% ACN, in water. Directly infuse the effluent via the Dionex nanoLC pump into the QSTAR Elite MS, such that the peak width is ~30 s. Conduct data-dependent MS/MS fragmentation of precursor ions on the top 3 ions with a 250 s exclusion time. Externally calibrate the instrument daily with the peptide mixture. 3.13.3. Option 3: nanoLC-MS n Load 2 pmol of a pepsin or trypsin digest into a pre-equilibrated, self-packed C 18 column mounted on the Eskigent nanoLC pump. Elute peptides with a 0–68% linear gradient of a buffer composed of 2% water, 0.1% formic acid in ACN, over 45 min directly infused into the LTQ XL MS at a rate of 200 nL/min. Conduct a MS survey scan of the range from 300–1800 m/z every 1–2 s, followed by data-dependent MS/MS fragmentation at 35% collision energy on the top three ions, with a 120 s exclusion time. 3.14. Glycopeptide Data Analysis Select glycopeptide elution intervals from an extracted ion chromatogram of the MS/MS spectra based on the presence of glycan oxonium ions at m/z 146, 162, 203 or disaccharide combinations. Program the detection using Analyst software for the QSTAR, or Xcalibur software for the LTQ. Examine regions of the chromatogram containing signature glyconium ions for candidate glycopeptide ions consisting of peptide fragment ions decorated with glycan types from the glycomic analysis above. Expand the search by manually probing the entire LC/MS-MS run for mass matches against the predicted glycopeptides. Estimate the relative abundance of each glycoform on a single glycosylation site by dividing its ion intensity by the sum of ion intensities for all of the glycoforms within a glycopeptide family over the entire elution window. Confirm by averaging over separate LC/MS-MS experiments. The assumption that each glycoform exhibits equal ionization efficiency is likely valid for neutral glycans. 3.15. N-glycan Site Mapping Perform de-N-glycosylation in a 1:1 mixture of H 2 16 O and H 2 18 O. PNGases convert the glycosylated asparagine residue into an aspartate and incorporate either an 16 O or an 18 O atom, resulting in a 1 or 3-Da increase in mass of the residue relative to unmodified asparagines. Detect peptides bearing N-glycosylated sites based on appearance of signal doublets separated by 2 mass units when analyzed by MALDI-TOF or nLC-electrospray MS. Infer partial site occupancy by presence of unmodified peptides. Identify peptides in MS/MS fragmentation experiments to sequence the peptides and confirm the mass difference at the N-sequon site. 3.16. Western blotting Analyze crude whole cell extracts or purified glycoproteins of interest by Western blotting after separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. Use standard Western blot procedures to probe the membrane with anti-carbohydrate antibody or lectin, such as rabbit anti-HRP for α3-linked core Fuc, or biotin-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin lectin followed by either alkaline phosphatase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody or alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-biotin antibody, followed by subsequent color detection with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium.
