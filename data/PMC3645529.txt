 We have used transient kinetics, nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and kinetics simulations to resolve a structural transition in the Dictyostelium myosin II relay helix during the actin-activated power stroke. The relay helix plays a critical role in force generation in myosin, coupling biochemical changes in the ATPase site with the force-transducing rotation of the myosin light-chain domain. Previous research in the absence of actin showed that ATP binding to myosin induces a dynamic equilibrium between a bent prepower stroke state of the relay helix and a straight postpower stroke state, which dominates in the absence of ATP or when ADP is bound. We now ask whether actin binding reverses this transition and if so, how this reversal is coordinated with actin-activated phosphate release. We labeled a Cys-lite Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain with donor and acceptor probes at two engineered Cys residues designed to detect relay helix bending. We then performed transient time-resolved FRET following stopped-flow mixing of actin with labeled myosin, preincubated with ATP. We determined the kinetics of actin-activated phosphate release, using fluorescent phosphate-binding protein. The results show that actin binding to the myosin.ADP.P complex straightens the relay helix before phosphate dissociation. This actin-activated relay helix straightening is reversible, but phosphate irreversibly dissociates from the postpower stroke state, preventing reversal of the power stroke. Thus, relay helix straightening gates phosphate dissociation, whereas phosphate dissociation provides the thermodynamic driving force underlying force production. Keywords: muscle, time-resolved FRET, structural kinetics The myosin ATPase family uses the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to power a cycle of changes in myosin structure. These changes perform mechanical work, essential for motility in all eukaryotic cells. The efficient production of work by myosins is controlled by nucleotide and actin binding in coordination with a reversible rotation of the myosin light-chain domain, hypothesized to act as a force transducing “lever arm”. The myosin relay helix is crucial for this coordination. The structure of the relay helix is coupled to nucleotide binding and to the orientation of the light-chain domain. The relay helix is straight when myosin is crystallized with bound nonhydrolyzed ATP, prehydrolysis ATP analogs, or ADP or in the absence of nucleotide and bent when crystallized with bound posthydrolysis ATP analogs. There is no crystal structure of myosin bound to actin, but the relay helix is straight in a myosin-V crystal structure that is hypothesized to exhibit features of an actin-bound state and also in a 0.8-nm resolution cryo-electron microscopy model of actin-bound myosin. In each of these studies, the orientation of the light-chain domain mirrors the structural state of the helix—when the helix is bent, the light-chain domain is in a prepower-stroke orientation, and when the helix is straight, the light-chain domain is in a postpower-stroke orientation. Fig. 1. Structural states of the myosin relay helix detected by time-resolved spectroscopy performed in biochemical steady-state or equilibrium. Aligned crystal structures of S1dC showing straight and bent structural states of the... The structural dynamics of the relay helix are coupled to nucleotide binding in solution. ATP binding initiates a tryptophan fluorescence change in the relay loop, C-terminal to the helix. This change is hypothesized to coincide with relay helix bending and with the myosin recovery stroke, essential for force production. The forward and reverse rate constants for this transition are >100 s −1 before ATP hydrolysis and <1 s −1 after hydrolysis. In the absence of actin, the slow, post hydrolysis reversal of the recovery stroke precedes phosphate dissociation, the rate-limiting biochemical step. Because actin binding increases the myosin phosphate release rate, actin should accelerate this transition and straighten the relay helix, coinciding with the initiation of the power stroke. A previous study reported tryptophan fluorescence transients near the relay helix during actin-binding transitions in the presence of ATP, but that study was complicated by substantial tryptophan fluorescence and light scattering from actin. We set out to test these hypotheses more directly, using spectroscopic distance measurements that detect relay helix structure. EPR and FRET were used to measure helix bending in the absence of actin. This study showed that the relay helix exists in dynamic equilibrium between a straight state that predominates in the presence of ADP or no nucleotide and a bent state induced by analogs of ATP or ADP.P. Another study introduced an approach called transient time-resolved FRET, 2 FRET, detecting nanosecond-resolved FRET, simultaneously sensitive to both the M* and the M** structural states of the relay helix, during the millisecond-resolved transient phase following the stopped-flow mixing of ATP with labeled myosin. This approach allowed us to resolve the mole fractions of the M* and M** structural states of the relay helix directly and simultaneously during the transient myosin recovery stroke, showing that ATP binding stabilizes the M** state before hydrolysis and that both structural states remain populated throughout the transient. The present study extends this approach to include actin, to probe the pivotal actin-activated myosin power stroke. We first use both TR-FRET and EPR-based distance measurements to resolve the M* and M** structural states in the presence of actin under steady-state biochemical conditions. We then mix FRET-labeled myosin with ATP and then perform 2 FRET after rapid mixing with excess actin. In parallel experiments, we measure phosphate release kinetics, using a fluorescent phosphate-binding protein. Thus, we detect the power stroke structural kinetics in real time and determine the temporal correlation with phosphate release, to answer one of the most fundamental questions about actomyosin force generation: How is the power stroke coordinated with actin-activated dissociation of hydrolyzed phosphate? Results Resolution of the Straight and Bent Structural States of the Relay Helix in Biochemical Steady States by TR-FRET and DEER. Previous work from this laboratory showed that the relay helix is partitioned between straight M* and bent M** structural states that can be detected by both TR-FRET and time-resolved EPR. The M* state predominates in the absence of nucleotide or when ADP is bound to myosin, whereas in the presence of ATP, the helix is in dynamic equilibrium between the M* and M** states. These studies were performed in the absence of actin. We now use a similar strategy to test the hypothesis that actin stabilizes the M* state, straightening the relay helix during the weak-to-strong actin-binding transition in the presence of ATP, i.e., the power stroke. We began by measuring the effect of actin on relay helix structure under equilibrium or steady-state biochemical conditions. TR-FRET was performed, measuring the distance between AEDANS and DABCYL attached at engineered cysteine labeling sites in an expressed Dictyostelium myosin 2 catalytic domain construct, termed S1dC, in the presence of ATP or actin. Probes attached at these sites detect relay helix bending as an increase in FRET via a decrease in AEDANS lifetime. We equilibrated donor-only or FRET-labeled myosin with ATP or actin and then acquired time-resolved fluorescence waveforms. The measured waveforms in the absence of nucleotide and actin were nearly identical to those in the presence of actin. In the presence of excess ATP, the nanosecond decay rate increased, clearly indicating increased FRET and decreased interprobe distance, consistent with relay helix bending. We analyzed the TR-FRET waveforms by fitting the combined set of donor-only and FRET-labeled samples to a global time-resolved FRET model in which each structural state corresponds to a Gaussian distribution of interprobe distances. As reported previously, two structural states indicated by a short interprobe distance distribution and a longer more disordered distance distribution were resolved in the presence of ATP. In the apo and rigor samples, the mole fraction of the M* state is 1.0; i.e., M** is not detected. Addition of ATP shifts the distribution, decreasing M* to 0.59 and increasing M** to 0.41. The time-resolved fluorescence. anisotropy, and accessibility of myosin labeled with the AEDANS donor alone were not affected by ATP or actin, indicating that the nucleotide- and actin-dependent changes in the M*/M** equilibrium reflect changes in energy transfer, not changes in the fluorescence or dynamics of the AEDANS donor. We used time-resolved EPR to measure the distance between spin labels attached at these same sites in the absence or presence or either actin or ATP analogs. We detected a single distance in the apo samples. Binding of the ATP analogs ADP.Aluminum.Fluoride or ADP.Vanadate, induced a second shorter distance. Samples containing actin exhibited a single distance distribution that was similar to that of the apo state. Together, the TR-FRET and DEER experiments show that the relay helix is partially bent in the presence of ATP without actin and completely straight when myosin is bound to actin in rigor. Direct Detection of the Actin-Activated Power Stroke by Transient Time-Resolved FRET. We determined the structural kinetics of the M* and M** states during the weak-to-strong actin binding transition in the presence of ATP by detecting 2 FRET. This experiment was performed using a single-mix stopped-flow device capable of acquiring nanosecond-resolved TR-FRET waveforms every 0.1 ms during a biochemical rapid-mixing experiment. To overcome the single-mix limitations of the stopped-flow accessory, we performed these experiments with a 1:17 mixture of myosin with ATP in syringe A and actin with 2 mM ADP in syringe B. When bound to actin, the myosin used in this study binds ADP with a 14-μM K d. Thus, the added ADP competes with the residual ATP and traps the rigor complex after a single ATP turnover. Under these conditions, actin binding to myosin in the presence of ATP caused a transient increase in the lifetime of the 2 FRET waveforms, showing that actin straightens the helix in the presence of ATP. Fig. 2. 2 FRET, nanosecond time-resolved FRET during a millisecond-resolved biochemical transient, using AEDANS/DABCYL-labeled myosin S1dC. Representative 2 FRET double-kinetics waveform matrix.... We globally fitted a set of 2 FRET waveforms corresponding to donor-only and FRET-labeled myosin, in the presence of ATP and in the presence and absence of actin, with the M*/M** structural model described in Fig. 1. This allowed us to simultaneously define the two structural states, M* and M**, and the time-dependent mole fractions of these states during the ATP-induced recovery stroke and weak-to-strong actin-binding transient. This two-state model was sufficient to describe the waveforms through the entire course of the transient over all actin concentrations examined; i.e., adding an additional structural state to the model did not decrease the fit χ 2. Thus, M* and M** are the only two structural states resolved by 2 FRET in our experiments. ATP binding to myosin caused the mole fraction of the M* state to decrease, and actin binding to myosin in the presence of ATP reversed this transition. The actin-activated M* and M** transients exhibited three distinct kinetics components : 2 ): a rapid-equilibrium phase that was largely complete in the first 10 ms, an actin-dependent phase that increased from 50 s −1 at 10 μM actin to more than 100 s −1 at 40 μM actin, and a slow phase that was insensitive to increasing actin. Table 1. Summary of rate constants for actin-activated structural and biochemical transitions: experiments Table 2.

M**→M* transients from 2 FRET. Actin dependence of phase 2 yields a maximum rate of straightening k max = 200 ± 60 s −1, with K 0.5... The mole fraction of M* and M** states did not change when we mixed FRET-labeled myosin with actin in the absence of ATP or when we mixed FRET-labeled myosin bound to actin with 1 mM ADP, indicating that the M**→M* transition observed in reflects the actin-dependent reversal of the recovery stroke and not structural changes associated with actin or ADP binding. These results are supported by control experiments performed using a conventional stopped-flow device capable of sequential mixing but not TR-FRET. These controls confirmed that actin binding to myosin increases the average distance between FRET probes, whereas neither actin nor ADP affects FRET in the absence of ATP. Furthermore, the amplitude of the total FRET change increased with increasing aging time between the first mix with ATP and the second mix with actin. The amplitude of the FRET change was maximal when the myosin/ATP mixture reached biochemical steady state, as indicated by experiments detecting ATP binding and hydrolysis via tryptophan fluorescence and by FRET following a single mix of myosin with 100 μM ATP. Thus, the actin-dependent change in FRET is sensitive not only to ATP binding, but also to ATP hydrolysis, and reflects actin-induced straightening of the relay helix in the posthydrolysis myosin.ADP.P biochemical state. This control also shows that the 2 FRET experiments, performed under steady-state myosin/ATP conditions, exhibited the maximum actin-activated change in the M*/M** equilibrium. Actin Straightens the Relay Helix Before Phosphate Release. ATP binding initiates the relay helix recovery stroke, increasing the mole fraction of the bent M** state 2 ). It has been proposed that phosphate dissociation following hydrolysis is coupled to helix straightening. To test this hypothesis, we measured actin-activated phosphate release, using phosphate-binding protein labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin, mixing myosin with ATP, aging the sample for 1 s to allow pre- and posthydrolysis states to reach steady state, and then mixing the steady-state reaction with varied concentrations of actin. The resulting increase in fluorescence of MDCC-PBP was biphasic. The fast phase reflects the actin-activated phosphate release burst from the posthydrolysis myosin.ADP.P biochemical state, whereas the slow phase reflects equilibration of prehydrolysis states through hydrolysis as well as slow removal of free phosphate by the phosphate mop added to scavenge micromolar contaminating phosphate from the stopped-flow instrument and buffers. The observed rate constant for the phosphate release burst increased with increasing actin 2 ) and was always slower than phase 1 and phase 2 of relay helix straightening and faster than phase 3 of helix straightening. Phosphate release was faster than actin-activated ADP dissociation measured during single-nucleotide turnover, 2 ), which increased hyperbolically with K 0.5 = 13.0 ± 1.2 μM and maximum k obs = 6.5 ± 0.31 s −1, comparable to the steady-state ATPase V max. The difference in the actin dependence of helix straightening, phosphate release, and nucleotide turnover indicates that actin binding initiates an isomerization in the relay helix that precedes dissociation of phosphate and dissociation of ADP. This hypothesis is discussed below. Discussion Powerstroke Precedes Phosphate Release. After ATP binding initiates the recovery stroke and hydrolysis, phosphate dissociates through either the futile power stroke or the actin-activated power stroke pathway. In the absence of actin, the forward rate constant for the futile power stroke step is slow, limiting the rate of phosphate release and ATPase cycling. The coordination of phosphate release and the power stroke during actin activation is under debate. Does the power stroke precede phosphate release or does phosphate release precede the power stroke ? Our 2 FRET experiments provide a clear answer. Solutions to the differential equations that describe SI Methods, Scheme 2a and SI Methods, Scheme 2b show that in SI Methods, Scheme 2a, the value of k obs for the power stroke is always equal to or greater than that of phosphate release, whereas the opposite is true in SI Methods, Scheme 2b. 2 FRET shows that both phase 1 and phase 2 of the actin-activated M**→M* transition 2 ) are substantially faster than phosphate release. This result is consistent with SI Methods, Scheme 2a but not with SI Methods, Scheme 2b, so we conclude that the M**→M* transition precedes phosphate release. M*/M** Equilibrium Is Coupled to Actin Binding and Hydrolysis. To determine whether the above conclusion, that relay helix straightening gates phosphate release, is consistent with the total actomyosin ATPase cycle, we used numerical integration performed with the KinTek Explorer global analysis software to model the structural kinetics of an expanded actomyosin ATPase scheme. Our model contains three myosin structural states, each of which binds nucleotide and actin. In our scheme, M and M* reflect straight structural states of the helix, with only the M state capable of exchanging free and bound nucleotide and the M* state exhibiting increased nucleotide binding affinity. M** reflects the bent structural state of the helix. We globally fitted the rate constants in Scheme 3 to data from stopped-flow experiments measuring actin and nucleotide binding, actin-activated phosphate release, actin-activated ATP turnover, the recovery stroke and power stroke detected by 2 FRET, and the steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity. Best-fit equilibrium constants are shown in Fig. 4 A, representative data and fits are shown in Fig. S7, and rate and equilibrium constants are tabulated in Fig. S8. The fit recapitulates transient changes in nucleotide and actin binding, the M* and M** states, phosphate and ADP release, and the steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity K m and V max. 2 ). These simulations were consistent with near-irreversible phosphate dissociation and with the total equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis, assuming a >10-mM K d for phosphate binding to myosin.ADP and actomyosin.ADP. Fig. 4. Structural kinetics of the M* and M** structural states. Structural kinetics scheme containing straight and bent structural states and apo, T, DP, and D nucleotide and actin-bound states. Simulation of transient... The simulations show that the actin-binding affinity, K d, is coupled to the hydrolysis and structural state of the myosin species. The K d is 0.5 μM for M*T, 7 μM for M**T, and 91 μM for M**D.P. The simulations were not directly sensitive to the M*D.P state, because it is not significantly populated under the conditions of our experiments. However, microscopic reversibility of states thermodynamically coupled to M*D.P indicate that it binds actin with a K d of 9 μM. These results are consistent with previous observations that ATP hydrolysis decreases actin-binding affinity, from 1 μM to >20 μM. Actin binding increased the M*/M** equilibrium constant from 4.5 in the M*T↔M**T transition to 15 in the A.M*T↔A.M**T transition. The M*/M** equilibrium of posthydrolysis states is also shifted by actin from 0.3 in the M*D.P↔M**D.P transition to 3.5 in the A.M*D.P↔A.M**D.P transition, similar to the estimated equilibrium constant determined by relay loop tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of actin. Thus, whereas the A.M*D.P/A.M**D.P equilibrium controls the power stroke, the A.M*T/A.M**T equilibrium inhibits actin-associated hydrolysis from A.M**T while also preventing the recovery stroke before actomyosin dissociation. Kinetics simulations provided an explanation for the three distinct phases in the actin-activated M**→M* transient. Phase 1 is due to the reversal of the recovery stroke following rapid equilibrium binding of M*T to actin with a K d of 0.5 μM. Depletion of M*T by actin binding disrupts the M*T/M**T equilibrium, so M**T is rapidly converted to M*T. Phase 2 reflects the M**→M* transition following weaker binding of M**D.P to actin. Phase 3, which is independent of actin, reflects equilibration of accumulated prehydrolysis states M*T and M**T, in rapid equilibrium with actin-bound states AM*T and AM**T, with the rigor-bound A.M*D and A.M.D states through hydrolysis and subsequent phosphate and ADP turnover as well as dissociation of ATP from A.M.T, which binds ATP with a K d of 33 μM. Phosphate Release Provides the Thermodynamic Driving Force for the Power Stroke. The simulations indicate that SI Methods, Scheme 2a, in which helix straightening gates phosphate release, is consistent with the kinetics of the entire actomyosin ATPase cycle in solution. We find that actin binding to M**D.P accelerates the M*→M** transition from 0.05 s −1 to 600 s −1. Actin also stabilizes the postpower-stroke A.M*D.P state, increasing the M*/M** equilibrium constant from 0.3 to 3.5. Phosphate dissociates readily from the A.M*D.P state with a predicted rate constant of 45 s −1, in excellent agreement with the k max at saturating. The dissociation of inorganic phosphate from the A.M**D.P state converts myosin into the strong-binding A.M*D state with 38-nM actin-binding affinity. We found that ADP binding does not alter the structure of the relay helix. Thus, the A.M*D/A.M**D equilibrium is strongly poised toward the M* state. As a result, once phosphate dissociates, the myosin is trapped in a postpower-stroke state until ATP rebinding weakens the actomyosin interaction and lowers the free energy for the M*↔M** transition. Conclusions We have used 2 FRET to directly detect the key structural change within the myosin catalytic domain that defines the force-generating power stroke, actin-activated straightening of the relay helix. Our results show that actin straightens the relay helix in the early stages of the weak-to-strong actin-binding transition before phosphate release. We find that this straightening gates phosphate dissociation from myosin. The time-resolved measurements allowed direct and quantitative measurement of the mole fraction of bent and straight relay helix structural states and thus of the equilibrium constants for the critical actin-activated helix straightening transition. These results provide direct and vivid insight into one of the most enigmatic aspects of myosin enzymology, the coordination of actin-activated phosphate release and the myosin power stroke. It will be interesting in the future to determine how force across the actomyosin cross bridge affects this coordination and how mutations that alter phosphate release affect the structural kinetics of the relay helix. Methods Protein Expression, Purification, and Labeling. All experiments in this study used a Cys-lite S1dC construct engineered for site-specific labeling by the introduction of reactive cysteine residues at positions 498 and 515. The design, expression, purification, and labeling of this construct are described in our previous reports. Myosin expression and purification were carried out as described in these reports, with slight modifications described in SI Methods. Following this procedure, the labeled S1dC constructs retained actin-activated ATPase activity for 3 d on ice without freezing. All experiments were performed during this time. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by acetone extraction and then stabilized with stochiometric excess of phalloidin followed by 24 h dialysis into nucleotide-free reaction buffer. Steady-State ATPase Activity. We measured actin-activated MgATPase activity, using an NADH-coupled assay. ATPase reactions contained labeled or nonlabeled S1dC 515.498 constructs; varied concentrations of nucleotide-free, phalloidin-stabilized actin, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 2 mM MgCl 2 ; and were initiated by the addition of 1mM MgATP. The reaction cuvette was maintained at 23 °C while we monitored the absorbance at 340 nm for 2 min. V max and K ATPase of the nonlabeled and labeled proteins are nearly identical. Transient Kinetics. Transient biochemical experiments with steady-state fluorescence detection were performed on an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrophotometer capable of sequential mixing experiments. The single-mix dead time for this instrument is 1.3 ms, calibrated using fluorescence enhancement of 8-hydroxyquinoline following Mg +2 binding under pseudo-first-order kinetics conditions. All buffers were filtered and then degassed for 30 min under vacuum before use. All stopped-flow experiments were performed at 20 °C, maintained by a circulating water bath. Transient time-resolved FRET, 2 FRET, was measured using a custom-made transient time-resolved fluorescence spectrophotometer. This instrument uses a Biologic USA SFM/20 single-mix stopped-flow accessory coupled to our transient time-resolved fluorescence spectrophotometer. The dead time for the instrument was 1.5 ms, calibrated using the 8-hydroxyquinoline + Mg +2 control reaction. For experiments mixing equilibrated myosin in the presence of 17 M excess ATP with actin, the actin was loaded into syringe A, followed by a freshly prepared 600-μL mixture of myosin + ATP in syringe B. Spectroscopic Data Acquisition and Analysis. The time-resolved fluorescence and transient time-resolved fluorescence spectrometers, described in refs. 20 – 22 and 31, transiently digitize the fluorescence emission following a 1-ns laser pulse repeated every 0.1 ms. For equilibrium and steady-state biochemical conditions, 1,000 replicate waveforms were signal averaged before analysis. For transient time-resolved measurements acquired after rapid mixing by stopped flow, 10 waveforms were averaged every 1 ms. Replicate stopped-flow mixing experiments were acquired independently and then each waveform was averaged with its respective sister waveforms in the matrix of replicate experiments. Total time-resolved fluorescence was measured with the emission polarizer set to the magic angle or removed. For polarized time-resolved fluorescence measurements, the emission polarizer was set successively to 0°, 54.7°, and 90°. Data acquired during TR-FRET and 2 FRET experiments were analyzed as described previously and elaborated in SI Methods. Time-resolved EPR-based distance measurements were carried out and analyzed as described previously. Supplementary Material Supporting Information: Click here to view.
