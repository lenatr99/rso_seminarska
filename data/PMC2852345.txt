 Dictyostelium discoideum phenylalanine hydroxylase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for structural analysis. Apo Dic PAH and Dic PAH complexed with dihydrobiopterin and Fe III were crystallized using 0.06 M PIPES pH 7.0, 26% PEG 2000 by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals of apo Dic PAH and the Dic PAH–BH 2 –Fe III complex diffracted to 2.6 and 2.07 Å resolution, respectively, and belonged to space group P 2 1, with unit-cell parameters a = 70.02, b = 85.43, c = 74.86 Å, β = 110.12° and a = 70.97, b = 85.33, c = 74.89 Å, β = 110.23°, respectively. There were two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure of Dic PAH has been solved by molecular replacement. Keywords: phenylalanine hydroxylase, tetrahydrobiopterin, Dictyostelium discoideum 1. Introduction The nonhaem iron-dependent enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of the aromatic amino acid l -phenylalanine to l -tyrosine in the presence of the specific cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin and dioxygen. As l -Tyr is the precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine, the catabolism of l -Phe plays an essential role in the development of the neural system. Disorder of the PAH system leads to the diseases phenylketonuria and hyperphenyl­alaninaemia, which result in brain-development problems unless treated immediately after birth. Full-length mammalian PAHs consist of three domains: an N-terminal regulatory domain, a central catalytic domain and a short C-­terminal oligomerization domain for tetramer formation. The catalytic site includes a nonhaem Fe atom coordinated by a His-His-Glu catalytic triad that is highly conserved in aromatic amino-acid hydroxylases. Dysfunction of human PAH is mostly caused by mutations that are found in the catalytic domain. These mutations demonstrate different clinical, metabolic and enzymatic phenotypes. Crystallographic studies of human and rat PAHs revealed the binding sites of the pterin cofactor and the substrate, and provided insights into the substrate-specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Mammalian PAH responds with positive cooperativity to increased concentration of the substrate. There are four possible BH 4 stereoisomers: l - erythro -BH 4, l - threo -BH 4, d - erythro -BH 4 and d - threo -BH 4. l - erythro -BH 4 is ubiquitous in animals as the natural cofactor for aromatic amino-acid hydroxylases, whereas the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum produces both l - erythro -BH 4 and d - threo -BH 4. Interestingly, Dictyostelium PAH uses both as co­factors, although it exhibits higher activity with DH 4 than with l -­ erythro -BH 4. This indicates that Dic PAH possesses dual cofactor specificity. However, no structural information is available on the binding of DH 4 to PAH. In order to understand the enzyme-catalysis mechanism and dual cofactor specificity, Dic PAH was purified and crystallized for structural analysis. Three-dimensional structures of Dic PAH will provide a deeper understanding of the cofactor specificity of the hydroxylase reaction and its regulatory properties. 2. Experimental 2.1. Protein expression and purification Dic PAH was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pProEx HTa to produce a recombinant protein with an N-­terminal hexahistidine tag and a TEV protease cleavage site. Escherichia coli strain BL21 was used for protein expression. 100 ml aliquots of an overnight culture were seeded into 1000 ml fresh Luria–Bertani medium containing ampicillin at 310 K with vigorous shaking until the OD 600 reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced for 5 h with 0.4 m M isopropyl β- d -1-thiogalactoside at 303 K and cells were harvested by centrifugation. The harvested cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 277 K, the clear supernatant was filtered and loaded onto an open column of nickel–NTA beads pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed first with ten column volumes of binding buffer and then with ten column volumes of washing buffer. The recombinant Dic PAHΔ415 was eluted with 50 m M Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 100 m M NaCl, 300 m M imidazole. Fractions containing Dic PAHΔ415 were pooled, concentrated and exchanged into 50 m M Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 1 m M EDTA by ultrafiltration. The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was then removed using 0.02 mg TEV protease per milligram of protein at 277 K overnight, leaving artifactual residues GAMDPEF at the N-terminus. After removal of the His tag, the Dic PAHΔ415 was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a Resource 15Q column. The protein was eluted using a salt gradient and eluted at ∼200 m M NaCl pH 7.5. The fractions containing the Dic PAHΔ415 protein were finally purified by gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column in 20 m M Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 150 m M NaCl. The Dic PAHΔ415 protein was pooled and concentrated to 10 mg ml −1 in 20 m M Tris–HCl pH 8.0 by ultrafiltration for crystallization. The protein purity was examined by SDS–PAGE and native PAGE. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. 2.2. Crystallization and data collection Crystallization of apo Dic PAHΔ415 was initially carried out using Crystal Screens I and II and Index Screen from Hampton Research, Wizard Screens I and II and Cryo Screens I and II from Emerald BioStructures and laboratory-made solutions using a microbatch crystallization method at 291 K. Drops containing equal volumes of protein solution and screening solution were equilibrated under Al’s oil in a 72-well microbatch plate. After crystals of apo Dic PAHΔ415 were produced from the initial screenings, further screenings to find optimal crystallization conditions were performed using hanging-drop vapour-diffusion trials, varying the pH range, type of precipitant, precipitant concentration and volume of the drop. To obtain crystals of the Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 complex, BH 2 was used as BH 4 is not stable under aerobic conditions. Apo Dic PAHΔ415 was incubated with 2 m M BH 2 for 1 h on ice prior to setting up crystallization. The Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 complex crystals grew in the same condition as the apo Dic PAHΔ415 crystals. To incorporate Fe III into the protein, the crystals of Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 were soaked in well solution containing 5 m M Fe 2 2 for 1 h before flash-freezing. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection after soaking for 1 min in reservoir solution containing 12% ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction data were collected from apo Dic PAHΔ415 and Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 –Fe III crystals using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector with X-rays of wavelength 1.23985 Å on beamlines 4A and 6C1 of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Republic of Korea, with exposure times of 30 s and 10 s for 1° oscillations at crystal-to-detector distances of 200 and 150 nm, respectively. All diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL -2000. Molecular replacement was performed using the program AMoRe. 3. Results Residues 1–415 of D. discoideum PAH, corresponding to the N-terminal regulatory and central catalytic domains, were expressed in E. coli and purified for crystallization by nickel-affinity, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The molecular weight of the protein was estimated to be about 48 kDa from SDS–PAGE, which is similar to the theoretical molecular weight of 47.5 kDa. The protein was separated by gel-filtration chromatography with an effective mass of 80 kDa, suggesting that the protein exists as a dimer in solution. From the initial crystallization trials, dendritic apo Dic PAHΔ415 crystals were found using the screening solution 0.1 M PIPES pH 6.5, 30% PEG 4000. Apo Dic PAHΔ415 crystals that were suitable for diffraction experiments were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 291 K in a drop containing 5 µl 6 mg ml −1 protein solution and 5 µl of a mixture of 9 µl reservoir solution and 1 µl 0.1 M l -proline as an additive. The crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm in 3–4 d. Data were collected to 2.6 Å resolution from a single crystal of apo Dic PAHΔ415 and were pro­cessed in the monoclinic space group P 2 1, with unit-cell parameters a = 70.02, b = 85.43, c = 74.86 Å, β = 110.12°. Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 complex crystals were obtained using the same condition as the apo Dic PAHΔ415 crystals and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm in 3–4 d. The crystals of the Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 –Fe III complex were produced by soaking the Dic PAHΔ415–BH 2 complex crystals. The Dic PAH–BH 2 –Fe III complex crystal diffracted to 2.07 Å resolution and belonged to space group P 2 1, with unit-cell parameters a = 70.97, b = 85.33, c = 74.89 Å, β = 110.23°. For both crystal forms it was clear that higher resolution data were available and we plan to collect these data as soon as possible. The asymmetric unit contained two Dic PAHΔ415 molecules, with a Matthews coefficient V M of 2.24 Å 3 Da −1 and an estimated solvent content of 45.23%. The crystal of the Dic PAHΔ415–BH2–Fe III complex had essentially the same Matthews coefficient and therefore the same number of molecules in the asymmetric unit and the same percentage solvent content. The structure of Dic PAHΔ415 could be determined by molecular replace­ment using the program AMoRe. The human PAH catalytic domain was used as a search model for molecular replacement, as it shares 64% amino-acid sequence identity in the catalytic domain. After a rotation and translation search, a solution consisting of two catalytic domains with a correlation coefficient of 33.3 and an R factor of 52.2% could be found and was refined to a correlation coefficient of 53.8 and an R factor of 45.7% using the fitting function in AMoRe. The missing N-­terminal regulatory domain could be built into the electron densities calculated from the molecular-replacement solution. Detailed discussion of the refined structures of both crystals will be published elsewhere. Figure 1 Purification of Dic PAHΔ415. The purity of the Dic PAHΔ415 was confirmed by SDS–PAGE.
