 Live-cell imaging is extremely common in synthetic biology research, but its ability to be applied reproducibly across laboratories can be hindered by a lack of standardized image analysis. Here, we introduce a novel cell segmentation method developed as part of a broader Independent Verification & Validation program aimed at characterizing engineered Dictyostelium cells. Standardizing image analysis was found to be highly challenging: the amount of human judgment required for parameter optimization, algorithm tweaking, training and data pre-processing steps forms serious challenges for reproducibility. To bring automation and help remove bias from live-cell image analysis, we developed a self-supervised learning method that recursively trains itself directly from motion in live-cell microscopy images without any end-user input, thus providing objective cell segmentation. Here, we highlight this SSL method applied to characterizing the engineered Dictyostelium cells of the original IV&V program. This approach is highly generalizable, accepting images from any cell type or optical modality without the need for manual training or parameter optimization. This method represents an important step toward automated bioimage analysis software and reflects broader efforts to design accessible measurement technologies to enhance reproducibility in synthetic biology research.
