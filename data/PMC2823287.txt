 When presented with a gradient of chemoattractant, many eukaryotic cells respond with polarized accumulation of the phospholipid PtdlnsP 3. This lipid asymmetry is one of the earliest readouts of polarity in neutrophils, Dictyostelium discoideum and fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms that regulate PtdlnsP 3 polarization are not well understood. Using a cationic lipid shuttling system, we have delivered exogenous PtdlnsP 3 to neutrophils. Exogenous PtdlnsP 3 elicits accumulation of endogenous PtdlnsP 3 in a positive feedback loop that requires endogenous phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases Ks) and Rho family GTPases. This feedback loop is important for establishing PtdlnsP 3 polarity in response to both chemoattractant and to exogenous PtdlnsP 3 ; it may function through a self-organizing pattern formation system. Emergent properties of positive and negative regulatory links between PtdlnsP 3 and Rho family GTPases may constitute a broadly conserved module for the establishment of cell polarity during eukaryotic chemotaxis. By combining genetics and pharmacology to inhibit signalling cascades, we are beginning to understand the components that are necessary for directed cell polarity. However, the mechanisms through which these components interact to produce cell polarity are less well understood. Here, we focus on the role of the phospholipid PtdInsP 3 in the cell polarization process. This lipid has a strong polarity during chemotaxis of Dictyostelium 1, 2, neutrophils 3 and fibroblasts 4. The internal gradient of PtdInsP 3 exceeds that of the external chemoattractant gradient and is one of the most upstream signalling molecules known to do so during cell polarization 3. Pharmacological, biochemical and genetic inhibition of PtdInsP 3 production interfere with cell polarity and chemotaxis in many systems 5 – 10. Furthermore, PtdInsP 3 itself suffices to induce cell polarity and motility in neutrophils 11 and fibroblasts 12. Thus, PtdInsP 3 occupies a privileged position as the most upstream molecule known to exhibit asymmetry during chemotaxis and one of the most downstream molecules that suffices to induce cell polarity and motility. To explore how this lipid regulates cell polarity, we have assessed the effects of delivering exogenous PtdInsP 3 to cells which contain an internal probe that allows the spatial distribution of PIK lipid products to be determined. PtdInsP 3 polarization during chemotaxis could result from the polarized activation of chemoattractant receptors or PIKs. Alternatively, it could reflect signals generated downstream of PtdInsP 3 production. To test the latter hypothesis, we sought to deliver exogenous PtdInsP 3 to neutrophils. PtdInsP 3 and other anionic phospholipids do not permeate the membranes of most cells. However, when complexed to cationic carriers, such as histone, phosphoinositides can be delivered to cells and exert physiological responses 13. To assess the spatial distribution of PIK lipid products, we used neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells, which express PH-Akt–GFP, a fusion protein that specifically binds to PtdInsP 3 and PtdInsP 2. At early times after incubation with C16-PtdInsP 3 complexed to histone, cells exhibit ruffling and uniform translocation of PH-Akt–GFP to the plasma membrane. Lower concentrations of C16-PtdInsP 3 complexed to histone elicited approximately half this response. Figure 1 PtdlnsP 3 –histone induces translocation of PH-Akt–GFP Figure 2 Surface plots of PH-Akt–GFP distribution in neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells Cells polarize after incubation with PtdInsP 3 –histone for 2–3 min. Surprisingly, they also asymmetrically accumulate PH-Akt–GFP at the leading edge and migrate 1–2 cell diameters. These translocations can be observed most easily in the surface plots of Fig. 2. Polarity was usually maintained for 2–10 min. For almost all of the cells, the pattern of PH-Akt–GFP recruitment and polarization mirrored their actin rearrangements with the final polarized morphology, ranging from a more fibroblast-like crescent to the polarized cell pictured in Fig. 2e,f ; the latter pattern is typical of the majority of polarized cells. The patterns of polarity closely resemble those seen with fMLP as the stimulus. Similar data was obtained using a PtdInsP 3 antibody. These data suggest that PtdInsP 3 can induce its own asymmetry. Unstimulated cells 2a ) and cells incubated with PtdInsP 3 without a histone carrier failed to induce translocation of PH-Akt–GFP. This suggests that the PtdInsP 3 –histone effect is not mediated by an extracellular PtdInsP 3 receptor. This effect was not a general property of lipid–histone complexes, as PtdInsP 2 –histone failed to induce recruitment of PH-Akt–GFP. It is important to note that translocation of PH-Akt–GFP and polarization in response to PtdInsP 3 –histone is less robust than that seen in response to an optimal dose of chemoattractant. This suggests that activated receptors stimulate production of more PtdInsP 3 than we are able to deliver to the cells exogenously, or that signalling from chemoattractant receptors provides signals to the cell polarization process in addition to PtdInsP 3. To determine whether endogenous signalling cascades are necessary for the effects of PtdInsP 3 –histone on cells, we analysed the consequences of inhibiting endogenous PIKs and Rho GTPases with a PIK inhibitor or Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inhibits the actions of Rac, Rho and Cdc42 GTPases. Pretreating cells with LY 294002 completely prevented PtdInsP 3 –histone from inducing PH-Akt–GFP translocation. Wortmannin produces similar effects. Approximately 70% inhibition was observed with 100 μM LY 294002 ). Similar data was obtained using a PtdInsP 3 antibody instead of PH-Akt–GFP. These results suggest that the PH-Akt–GFP translocation observed after exposure of cells to PtdInsP 3 –histone does not depend solely on exogenous PtdInsP 3, but rather that PtdInsP 3 cooperates with endogenous PIKs in a positive feedback loop that is necessary to generate enough PtdInsP 3 for a response. Although our data are most consistent with a positive feedback loop, we cannot rule out a purely permissive role for endogenous PIK or basal PtdInsP 3 levels in the effects of exogenous PtdInsP 3 –histone with these experiments. The concentrations of LY294002 and wortmannin needed to block PtdInsP 3 -induced PH-Akt–GFP translocation are high when compared to doses of these inhibitors needed to block PIK signalling in other cells, such as fibroblasts. However, these mirror the concentrations necessary to block Akt phosphorylation, PH-Akt–GFP translocation 3 and PtdInsP 3 antibody staining in HL-60 cells in response to chemoattractant stimulation. This suggests that these cells are relatively resistant to PIK inhibitors. Intriguingly, at later times, some LY 294002-treated cells do show uniform translocation of PH-Akt–GFP to the plasma membrane ). This suggests that, given time, enough PtdInsP 3 can be delivered to the cells to generate PH-Akt–GFP translocation, even without a contribution from endogenous PIKs. However, these cells consistently failed to develop polarized PH-Akt–GFP distributions,, suggesting that the PtdInsP 3 positive feedback loop is important for developing PtdInsP 3 polarity. Figure 3 PIK and Rho GTPase inhibitors block PtdlnsP 3 –histone-induced PH-Akt–GFP translocation Similarly, pretreating cells with toxB prevented PtdInsP 3 –histone from inducing PH-Akt–GFP translocation. Because toxB also can induce cell lethality, we tested for cell viability by subsequently treating cells with insulin, which we previously demonstrated to induce Rho-GTPase-independent translocation of PH-Akt–GFP to the plasma membrane 3. Only cells that translocated PH-Akt–GFP in response to insulin were scored for their previous responsiveness to PtdInsP 3 –histone; of 77 cells that exhibited PH-Akt–GFP translocation in response to insulin, none showed PH-Akt–GFP translocation in response to incubation with PtdInsP 3 –histone. These data suggest that one or more Rho GTPases are necessary components of the PtdInsP 3 –histone-induced PtdInsP 3 positive feedback loop. Rho GTPase inhibition also blocks PH-Akt–GFP translocation 3 and Akt activation in cells responding to chemoattractant, suggesting that a similar signalling cascade operates during chemotaxis. The inhibitory effects of LY 294002 and toxB on responses to exogenous PtdInsP 3 –histone treatment could result from inhibition of PtdInsP 3 delivery to the cells, rather than from inhibiting cooperation between exogenous PtdInsP 3 and endogenous signalling cascades. To discriminate between these possibilities, we analysed delivery of fluorescently derivatized NBD-PtdInsP 3 –unlabelled histone to cells with and without inhibitors of PIK and Rho GTPases. In control cells that failed to polarize, NBD–PtdInsP 3 –histone was distributed uniformly at the cell periphery. By contrast, in cells that did polarize, NBD–PtdInsP 3 accumulated in the cell posterior. An important qualification of these results is that the fluorescent probe, located at the end of one of the phospholipid's fatty acid tails, is not destroyed by metabolism of the inositol head-group. Consequently, the observed fluorescence reflects delivery of exogenous PtdInsP 3 –histone to the cells, although it probably does not solely represent unmodified PtdInsP 3. Indeed, we never observe preferential accumulation of the PH-Akt–GFP at the trailing edge of polarized cells. Thus the NBD–PtdInsP 3 results suggest that accumulation of PH-Akt–GFP at the leading edge of polarized cells does not represent accumulation of exogenous PtdInsP 3 –histone at this location. Delivery of NBD–PtdInsP 3 to the cell periphery depends on the presence of histones. Although treatment with LY 294002 or toxB prevents cell polarization, these agents do not inhibit delivery of exogenous NBD–PtdInsP 3 to the cell periphery. Taken together, the data suggest that these agents do not produce their effects by inhibiting the cellular uptake of PtdInsP 3 –histone. Figure 4 Endogenous PIK and Rho GTPases are not required for PtdlnsP 3 –histone uptake Discussion These results, showing that translocation of PH-Akt–GFP to the plasma membrane in response to PtdInsP 3 –histone requires endogenous PIK activity and Rho GTPases, can be explained by postulating a positive feedback loop that involves PtdInsP 3 and the Rho GTPases. Such a feedback loop could explain paradoxical epistatic relations between Rho GTPases and PIKs identified in genetic, pharmacological and biochemical analyses: PIK activity has been shown to function upstream of Rac and Cdc42 activation 16, 17, but Rac and Cdc42 have been shown to function upstream of PtdInsP 3 generation 14, 18 – 21 ; this apparent paradox has sometimes been observed in the same cell, for example, in neutrophils 14, 17 and T-cells 19. Our findings suggest that these conflicting results may be explained by PtdInsP 3 and Rho GTPases functioning both upstream and downstream of one another in a positive feedback loop. One question concerns how such a feedback loop contributes to cell polarity during chemotaxis. A possible clue comes from models of mechanisms by which developmental organizers form self-organizing patterns from small gradients or stochastic differences in signalling 22. The first postulated ingredient of such pattern formation systems is a signal that amplifies itself in a short-range positive feedback fashion. We propose that the PtdInsP 3 - and Rho GTPase-dependent positive feedback loop provides this function in eukaryotic chemotaxis. The second ingredient of this self-organizing pattern formation system 22 is that signals from the activator generate a more long-range inhibitor of signalling. Good candidates for this inhibitory function in eukaryotic chemotaxis include negative regulators of PtdInsP 3 accumulation, such as the lipid phosphatases PTEN 23, 24 and SHIP 25, and negative regulators of Rho GTPase activation. In addition to chemotaxis 22, pattern formation systems that are consistent with this general model include hydra regeneration and retinotectal mapping. Good candidates for components in the positive feedback loop include: PtdInsP 3 activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rac, such as Prex 27, Cdc42/Rac-induced activation of PtdInsP 3 production through direct binding to the Rho GAP domain of the PIK adapter p85 or induction of PIP 2 generation through recruitment of PIK 29, which could increase availability of substrate for PtdInsP 3 production by PIKs. In summary, PtdInsP 3 asymmetries are observed during chemotaxis of many cells, from neutrophils 3 to Dictyostelium 1, 2 to fibroblasts 4, and in response to very different stimuli, such as ligands for G-protein coupled receptors 1 – 3 and tyrosine kinase receptors 4, as well as direct delivery of PtdInsP 3, as we have shown. We propose that the emergent properties of positive and negative regulatory links between PtdInsP 3 and Rho GTPases constitute a broadly conserved module for establishing cell polarity during eukaryotic chemotaxis. Such a polarity module could account for the remarkable convergence of behaviour among these widely diverse cells and chemotactic stimuli. Important future directions include dissecting the wiring of the putative positive and negative feedback loops and developing better tools to spatially analyse and manipulate protein and lipid activities. This will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of how eukaryotic cells polarize and migrate in response to cues from the world around them. Methods Cell preparation HL-60 cells expressing PH-Akt–GFP 3 were stimulated to differentiate, as described 3, except that endotoxin-free hybridoma-tested dimethyl sulphoxide was used. Treatment with LY 294002 and toxB were performed as described 3, except that LY 294002 was continuously incubated with the cells for LY 294002 treatment. Lipid delivery Long chain synthetic phospholipids were freshly prepared at 300 μM in 150 mM sodium chloride, 4 mM potassium chloride and 20 mM Hepes at pH 7.2, and resuspended by bath sonication or vigorous vortexing. Histone–phospholipid complexes were prepared by incubating 300 μM phospholipids with 100 μM freshly prepared histone, vortexed vigorously, incubated for 5 min at room temperature and diluted 1:10 with modified Hanks buffered saline solution 30 immediately before addition to HL-60 cells in suspension. Cells were immediately added to an agarose-lined coverslip using wide-bore pipette tips 30. Microscopy Images were acquired with an epifluorescence microscope and an axiovert confocal microscope. Quantitation of PH-Akt–GFP translocation and cell polarization were performed on random fields of living cells for a minimum of 3 independent experiments. We defined polarization as Akt recruitment continuously covering 25–75% of the cell surface. Cells with two independent fronts were not counted as polarized. Surface plots for Fig. 2 were generated from confocal images using NIH Image1.62.
