 Ca v 2.1 channels, which mediate P/Q-type Ca 2+ currents, undergo Ca 2+ /calmodulin -dependent inactivation and facilitation that can significantly alter synaptic efficacy. Here we report that the neuronal Ca 2+ -binding protein 1 modulates Ca v 2.1 channels in a manner that is markedly different from modulation by CaM. CaBP1 enhances inactivation, causes a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and does not support Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation of Ca v 2.1 channels. These inhibitory effects of CaBP1 do not require Ca 2+, but depend on the CaM-binding domain in the α 1 subunit of Ca v 2.1 channels. CaBP1 binds to the CaM-binding domain, co-immunoprecipitates with α 1 2.1 from transfected cells and brain extracts, and colocalizes with α 1 2.1 in discrete microdomains of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Our results identify an interaction between Ca 2+ channels and CaBP1 that may regulate Ca 2+ -dependent forms of synaptic plasticity by inhibiting Ca 2+ influx into neurons. Calcium entry into cells through voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels initiates a wide range of cellular processes including protein phosphorylation, gene expression and neurotransmitter release 1. Neuronal Ca 2+ channels consist of a pore-forming α 1 subunit and auxiliary β, α 2 δ and sometimes γ subunits 2, and their function depends considerably on interactions with additional regulatory factors. For example, the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors by neurotransmitters inhibits Ca v 2.1 and Ca v 2.2 channels, which mediate P/Q-type and N-type Ca 2+ currents, respectively, through the binding of G-protein βγ subunits to distinct sites on the Ca 2+ channel α 1 subunit 3 - 5. These channels are also inhibited by direct interactions with synaptic SNARE —a process that may optimize coupling between Ca 2+ entry and synaptic vesicle fusion 6 - 8. Characterizing the functional interactions between Ca 2+ channels and other signaling molecules is therefore crucial to understanding how many Ca 2+ -dependent processes in neurons are regulated. We have shown previously that the prominent Ca 2+ sensor CaM binds to a CaM-binding site in the carboxy-terminal domain of the α 1 2.1 subunit and mediates the dual feedback regulation of Ca v 2.1 channels by Ca 2+ ions 9, 10. A second site, located amino-terminal to the CBD, is analogous to the IQ domain that mediates Ca 2+ /CaM-dependent inactivation of Ca v 1 channels 11 - 13. The IQ domain of α 1 2.1 interacts with CaM in vitro and also contributes to the regulation of Ca v 2.1 channels by CaM 14, 15. Ca 2+ /CaM mediates both facilitation and enhanced inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channels in transfected cells during trains of depolarizations 10, 15. Presynaptic Ca v 2.1 channels in the brain undergo similar forms of Ca 2+ -dependent modulation that can lead to both synaptic facilitation and depression 16 - 18. Because Ca v 2.1 channels are essential to neurotransmitter release at most central synapses 19, 20, regulation by CaM may contribute widely to mechanisms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Calmodulin is the best characterized member of a superfamily of Ca 2+ -binding proteins that exhibit four EF-hand motifs, one or more of which may be nonfunctional in the coordination of Ca 2+. Included in this superfamily are the neuronal Ca 2+ -binding proteins that, unlike CaM, are localized primarily in neurons 22. Some NCBPs can substitute for CaM in vitro 23, 24, which suggests that NCBPs may regulate effectors that are typically thought to be modulated by CaM. Here we have studied the interaction of CaBP1, an NCBP located in the retina and brain 25, with Ca v 2.1 channels. We show that CaBP1 binds to the CBD of the α 1 2.1 subunit, but with properties and functional consequences that are different from those of CaM. Our findings expand the repertoire of modulatory interactions that take place between Ca 2+ channels and Ca 2+ -binding proteins and indicate that NCBPs, in addition to CaM, may have a role in the activity-dependent regulation of neuronal Ca 2+ influx. RESULTS CaBP1 interacts with the CBD of α 1 2.1 Although CaBP1 is a neuron-specific Ca 2+ -binding protein that shares nearly 56% amino acid sequence identity with CaM 25, it differs in having a consensus site for N-terminal myristoylation, an alternatively spliced region, inactivating amino acid substitutions in the second of the four EF-hand motifs, and an extra turn in the helical domain that links the N- and C-terminal lobes. To determine whether CaBP1 can substitute for CaM in interactions with Ca v 2.1 channels, we tested the ability of CaBP1 to interact with various intracellular domains of the α 1 2.1 subunit. In yeast two-hybrid assays, CaBP1 activated transcription of HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes only in yeast that had been cotransformed with α 1 2.1 constructs that included the CBD. CaBP1 did not interact with the IQ domain or with a control plasmid that lacked the CaBP1 coding region. These results indicated that CaBP1 may modulate Ca v 2.1 channel function through interactions with the CBD. Fig. 1 CaBP1 binds specifically to the CBD of α 1 2.1. Diagram of CaBP1 and CaM. The four Ca 2+ -binding EF-hand motifs are shown as boxes, and key structural differences between CaBP1 and CaM are indicated by arrows. Diagram of the rat brain α... To confirm that CaBP1 associated with the CBD in the intact channel, we tested whether CaBP1 co-immunoprecipitated with Ca v 2.1 channels from cotransfected tsA-201 cells. In this assay, CaM co-immunoprecipitates with α 1 2.1 in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner only when the cells are exposed to Ca 2+ ionophore 9. Under these conditions CaBP1 also co-immunoprecipitated with α 1 2.1. When Ca 2+ was buffered with 10 mM EGTA, however, the association of CaBP1 with the channel was not affected. This co-immunoprecipitation of CaBP1 was specific because CaBP1 was not immunoprecipitated with control IgG or with α 1 2.1-specific antibodies in cells transfected with CaBP1 alone, and CaBP1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with α 1 2.1 subunits that lacked the CBD. Thus, despite its Ca 2+ independence, the interaction between CaBP1 and Ca v 2.1 channels requires the same intracellular domain of Ca v 2.1 that binds CaM. Fig. 2 CaBP1 associates with the α 1 2.1 subunit in tsA-201 cells and rat brain. Lysates from cells transfected with Ca v 2.1 plus CaBP, CaBP1 alone or Ca v 2.1 ΔCBD plus CaBP1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified... CaBP1 associates with neuronal Ca v 2.1 channels To determine whether CaBP1 associated with endogenous Ca v 2.1 Ca 2+ channels, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done with extracts from rat cerebellum, which contains high concentrations of α 1 2.1 and CaBP1 mRNA 25, 26. Immunoblots of CaBP1 showed two proteins that specifically co-immunoprecipitated with α 1 2.1 but not with control IgG. The 36-kDa species might represent caldendrin, a larger isoform of CaBP1 that is produced from alternative splicing 25, 27. The 28-kDa species was consistent in size with the predicted molecular mass of the long CaBP1 isoform that we used in transfected cells, in support of a physiological interaction between neuronal Ca v 2.1 channels and CaBP1. To identify the potential cellular sites of interaction between CaBP1 and α 1 2.1, we immunostained rat brain sections with antibodies specific for both proteins. Compared with the immunostaining of α 1 2.1, the immunostaining for CaBP1 was generally far more restricted within the brain and more commonly associated with somatodendritic regions than with nerve terminals. However, CaBP1 and α 1 2.1 showed similar patterns of punctate staining in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. As a large proportion of punctate labeling of α 1 2.1 in the cerebellum colocalizes with that of syntaxin 28, it is likely that CaBP1 and Ca v 2.1 channels coexist in at least some presynaptic nerve terminals. Immunostaining for CaBP1 and for α 1 2.1 also overlapped in clusters along the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and in structures that resembled dendritic spines, however, which suggests that CaBP1 may associate with Ca v 2.1 channels in the post- as well as in the presynaptic membrane. Fig. 3 CaBP1 colocalizes with α 1 2.1 in rat brain sections. Rat brain sections were double-labeled with antibodies specific for CaBP1 and α 1 2.1. Labeling for CaBP1 is shown in green and for α 1 2.1 in red. In the merged images... CaBP1 enhances inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channels To elucidate the functional consequences of the interaction between CaBP1 and Ca v 2.1 channels, we determined the effect of CaBP1 on Ca 2+ currents in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of transfected tsA-201 cells. We first compared the effects of transfected CaBP1 and endogenous CaM on inactivation of I Ca. We have shown previously that Ca 2+Ca /CaM enhances the inactivation of I Ca during step depolarizations when intracellular recording solutions contain 0.5 mM EGTA 9, 10. Here, inactivation of I Ca caused by Ca 2+ /CaM proceeded with a single exponential time course that was relatively insensitive to the test voltage. By contrast, CaBP1 caused I Ca to decay significantly faster than in cells that were transfected with only Ca v 2.1. Fig. 4 CaBP1 enhances the inactivation of I Ca in tsA-201 cells transfected with Ca v 2.1 channels. Representative traces of I Ca from cells transfected with Ca v 2.1 either alone or with CaBP1. Currents were evoked by 1-s pulses to the indicated... In almost all of the cells that were cotransfected with CaBP1, the decay of I Ca evoked by +20- and +30-mV pulses was best fit by a double exponential function, with a slow component similar to control and a fast component comprising 30–40% of the peak current. With a +10-mV test pulse, however, biphasic inactivation was detected in only 11 out of 20 cells that had been cotransfected with CaBP1. At this test voltage, which elicits the peak inward I Ca, Ca 2+ /CaM-dependent inactivation is maximal 10. Therefore, the absence of a fast phase of inactivation in some cells cotransfected with CaBP1 might have resulted from more effective competition by Ca 2+ /CaM. Competition between CaM and CaBP1 for Ca v 2.1 channels was supported further by the observation of a marked reduction in Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation in cells cotransfected with CaBP1. Enhanced inactivation caused by CaM results in a significant reduction in the residual current at the end of a 1-second depolarizing test pulse normalized to the peak current for I Ca as compared with I Ba. By contrast, in cells cotransfected with CaBP1, I res / I pk was already reduced when Ba 2+ was the charge carrier and was not significantly different for I Ca and I Ba. Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation was not affected in the same way by cotransfection with CaM instead of CaBP1, which indicated that the faster, Ca 2+ -independent inactivation was a specific consequence of the modulation of Ca v 2.1 channels by CaBP1. Fig. 5 Fast, Ca 2+ -independent inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channels by CaBP1 differs from the modulation of Ca v 2.1 channels by CaM. Ca v 2.1 channel currents recorded with Ca 2+ or Ba 2+ as the permeant ion. Test pulses were applied from a holding voltage of −80... To clarify the effects of CaBP1 on fast inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channels, we measured the amplitude of I Ca at the 200-ms time point during a 1-s test pulse and normalized this to the peak current. We used more positive test voltages to limit Ca 2+ entry, thus minimizing the contribution of endogenous CaM in these experiments. With 0.5 mM EGTA, faster inactivation of I Ca in cells with CaBP1 caused a significant decrease in I 200 / I pk. CaBP1 significantly enhanced fast inactivation of I Ba and also of I Ca with 10 mM of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA. The CBD was essential for these effects on inactivation, because CaBP1 had no effect on channels in which this domain had been deleted. Together with biochemical analyses, these results support a Ca 2+ -independent association of CaBP1 with the CBD, which mediates a strong acceleration of Ca v 2.1 channel inactivation that does not require Ca 2+ influx or intracellular accumulation of Ca 2+. CaBP1 shifts voltage dependence of Ca v 2.1 activation In cells cotransfected with CaBP1 and Ca v 2.1, the normalized tail current–voltage curve was shifted positively and was shallower than in cells transfected with Ca v 2.1 alone. CaBP1 caused significant increases in the half-activation voltage, V 1/2, and slope factor of the tail current–voltage curve. Similar to the other actions of CaBP1 on Ca v 2.1 channels, these effects on I Ca activation were essentially reproduced with intracellular BAPTA and extracellular Ba 2+ but were not observed with Ca v 2.1 ΔCBD channels, which indicates that the Ca 2+ -independent association of CaBP1 with the CBD results in a newly identified, multifaceted regulation of Ca v 2.1 channels. Fig. 6 CaBP1 alters the voltage dependence of Ca v 2.1 activation. Tail current–voltage curves from tsA-201 cells transfected with Ca v 2.1 or Ca v 2.1 ΔCBD either alone or with CaBP1. Test pulses. This Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation was evident with 0.5 mM intracellular EGTA in paired-pulse protocols, in which Ca 2+ influx during a short prepulse induced a significant increase in the tail current elicited by a subsequent test pulse. With the same voltage protocol, no facilitation of I Ca was observed in cells cotransfected with CaBP1. Because of the strong voltage-dependent enhancement of I Ca inactivation caused by CaBP1, it was possible that paired-pulse facilitation in cells cotransfected with CaBP1 might have been obscured by the onset of inactivation during the conditioning prepulse. Alternatively, CaBP1, unlike CaM, might not support Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation of I Ca. Fig. 7 CaBP1 does not support Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation of Ca v 2.1 channels. Voltage dependence of Ca v 2.1 Ca 2+ currents evoked before and after a depolarizing prepulse. Tail currents were measured by repolarizing... To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the properties of I Ca during trains of short repetitive depolarizations, which should initially minimize the impact of voltage-dependent inactivation and reveal facilitation of I Ca early in the train. With 0.5 mM intracellular EGTA, Ca v 2.1 Ca 2+ currents undergo a sustained facilitation and gradually inactivate below initial current amplitudes after 800 ms of repetitive pulses, an effect that depends on Ca 2+ /CaM 10. In cells cotransfected with CaBP1, facilitation of I Ca was reduced markedly, with current amplitudes rapidly inactivating below initial values only 200 ms into the train. The maximum facilitated I Ca amplitude at 50 ms in cells cotransfected with CaBP1 was not significantly different from the Ca 2+ -independent facilitation of Ba 2+ currents in cells transfected with Ca v 2.1 alone or cotransfected with CaBP1, which indicated that CaBP1 does not support Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation of Ca v 2.1 channels. Together with the enhanced inactivation and positive shifts in activation caused by CaBP1, the absence of Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation would strongly limit voltage-dependent Ca 2+ entry through Ca v 2.1 channels. These results highlight further the different modulation of these Ca 2+ channels by CaBP1 and CaM. D iscussion We have shown that the neuronal Ca 2+ -binding protein CaBP1 interacts with and modulates Ca v 2.1 channels in a manner that is markedly different from that of CaM. CaBP1 bound to the CBD of α 1 2.1 but caused significantly faster inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channel currents than that caused by CaM. CaBP1 also positively shifted tail current-activation curves and did not support Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation of Ca v 2.1 currents. Neither the association of CaBP1 with the CBD nor the inhibitory modulation by CaBP1 required Ca 2+, in contrast to the effects of CaM on Ca v 2.1 channels, which are strictly dependent on Ca 2+. The observed association and colocalization of CaBP1 and Ca v 2.1 channels in neurons in the brain suggest that Ca 2+ channel regulation by CaBP1 may be an important determinant of Ca 2+ signaling pathways in neurons. Ca 2+ -independent binding and modulation by CaBP1 The Ca 2+ independence of the interaction between CaBP1 and Ca v 2.1 was unexpected given the previously observed Ca 2+ -dependent association of CaBP1 with other CaM targets 25. It is possible that very local rises in Ca 2+ might have escaped buffering by BAPTA in our experiments, which could have been sufficient for binding to CaBP1 and for causing Ca 2+ -dependent modulation of I Ca. This possibility seems unlikely, however, because the modulation by CaBP1 did not change appreciably when Ba 2+ was the permeant ion; Ba 2+ ions bind to EF-hand motifs with relatively low affinity and so should not reproduce Ca 2+ -dependent regulation of target molecules 29. Calcium-free CaM can associate with and regulate several targets, including the ryanodine receptor RyR1, cyclic GMP kinase and a CaM-dependent adenylyl cyclase from Bordetella pertussis 30 - 32. In addition, GCAPs—photoreceptor Ca 2+ -binding proteins—activate guanylyl cyclases in their Ca 2+ -free forms 33, 34. Thus, CaBP1 might have a similar flexibility and interact with and regulate some effectors without binding Ca 2+. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that CaBP1 may modulate some aspects of Ca 2+ channel function in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner, we found no evidence to support a requirement for Ca 2+ in the effects of CaBP1 on the activation and inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channels. Thus, despite the Ca 2+ -sensing capability of CaBP1, we propose that CaBP1 itself does not mediate Ca 2+ -dependent regulation of Ca v 2.1 channels, but might indirectly influence feedback regulation by Ca 2+ by competing with CaM. Thus, CaBP1 may act more like auxiliary Ca 2+ channel β-subunits by altering the intrinsic properties of Ca v 2.1 channels to fine-tune voltage-gated Ca 2+ entry in specific classes of neurons. Distinct modulation of Ca v 2.1 by CaBP1 and CaM We have shown that both CaM and CaBP1 interact with the CBD of the α 1 2.1 subunit and that this site is essential for full channel regulation by both proteins. Conflicting evidence indicates that the IQ domain—a sequence that is N-terminal to the CBD—is involved in the modulation of Ca v 2.1 channels by Ca 2+ /CaM 15. Our results do not support the importance of the IQ domain in modulation by CaBP1 because, first, CaBP1 interacted with the CBD but not the IQ domain in yeast two-hybrid assays ; second, deleting the CBD prevented the co-immunoprecipitation of CaBP1 with α 1 2.1 ; and third, the fast inactivation and shifts in the voltage dependence of activation caused by CaBP1 were abolished in channels that lacked the CBD. 6 ). Notably, removing the CBD from α 1 2.1 eliminated regulation by CaBP1 more completely than it eliminated regulation by CaM 10. Together, our results indicate that the CBD may be the primary determinant for the functional effects of CaBP1 on Ca v 2.1 channels. If both CaM and CaBP1 interact with the CBD, how is it that CaBP1 causes Ca 2+ -independent fast inactivation and positively shifted activation, whereas CaM causes Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation and inactivation of Ca v 2.1 channels? One possibility is that key structural features that distinguish CaBP1 from CaM, such as its extra-long central helical domain and N-terminal myristoylation, may permit Ca 2+ -independent binding of CaBP1 to the CBD, which might then lead to its unique inhibitory modulation of I Ca. Future experiments that determine how such differences between CaBP1 and CaM contribute to specific forms of Ca v 2.1 regulation may reveal how ion channels and other signaling molecules are differentially modulated by CaM and related Ca 2+ -binding proteins. Modulation of neuronal Ca v 2.1 channels by CaBP1 Our immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed that CaBP1 and α 1 2.1 associate physically in extracts of rat cerebellum and that their subcellular distributions overlap in this brain region, which indicates that CaBP1 may have a physiological role in the regulation of Ca v 2.1 channels. Because both CaM and CaBP1 interacted with the same site on the α 1 2.1 subunit, an important issue is whether Ca v 2.1 would interact functionally with CaM and/or CaBP1 in neurons in which both Ca 2+ -binding proteins are expressed. Although we do not know whether CaM and CaBP1 bind simultaneously to Ca v 2.1 channels, our electrophysiological studies suggested that CaM and CaBP1 might competitively regulate the channel. CaBP1 more strongly enhanced inactivation of I Ca when the influence of Ca 2+ /CaM was suppressed either with extracellular Ba 2+ or intracellular BAPTA, or with test voltages that elicited submaximal Ca 2+ influx. These results imply that when intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations are high Ca v 2.1 channels may be facilitated predominantly by CaM, and that the inactivating effects of CaBP1 become most prominent when cytoplasmic Ca 2+ concentrations decline. In this way, CaM and CaBP1 may coordinately act as a molecular switch to intensify neuronal Ca 2+ influx in response to activity-dependent alterations in intracellular concentrations of Ca 2+. NCBPs and synaptic transmission Emerging evidence supports a role for NCBPs in the regulation of synaptic transmission. In particular, neuronal Ca 2+ sensor-1, which is more distantly related to CaM than is CaBP1, regulates neurotransmitter release 35, synapse formation 36 and neuronal circuits that control associative learning 37. Notably, NCS-1 has been implicated in the negative regulation of Ca 2+ channels in chromaffin cells 38, which suggests that Ca v 2.1 channels may be modulated by NCBPs in addition to CaBP1. Given the widespread distribution of Ca v 2.1 channels throughout the nervous system, the cell type–specific modulation of Ca v 2.1 by CaBP1, CaM or other NCBPs may fundamentally determine the nature of presynaptic and postsynaptic Ca 2+ signals and the functional consequences of synaptic activity. M ethods Yeast two-hybrid assays. We amplified cDNAs encoding the long isoform of human CaBP1 and the cytoplasmic domains of α 1 2.1 by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned them into the yeast two-hybrid vectors pACT2 and pAS2-1, respectively. To test for interactions between CaBP1 and specific domains of α 1 2.1, the corresponding plasmids were cotransformed into yeast strain Y190. We assayed growth on medium lacking histidine and β-galactosidase to identify interacting proteins as described 9. Cell culture and transfection. We grew tsA-201 cells to ∼70% confluency and transfected them by the calcium phosphate method with an equimolar ratio of cDNAs encoding the rat brain Ca 2+ channel subunits α 1 2.1, β 2a and α 2 δ. The α 1 2.1 construct that lacks amino acids 1969–2000 has been described 10. The long isoform of human CaBP1 was subcloned into the Bam HI sites of pcDNA3.1+ and transfected at a 5:1 molar excess with Ca 2+ channel subunits. For electrophysiological experiments, we plated cells on 35-mm dishes and transfected them with 5 μg of total DNA, including 0.3 μg of a CD8 expression plasmid to allow the detection of transfected cells. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, we plated cells on 150-mm dishes and transfected them with 50 μg of total plasmid DNA. Co-immunoprecipitation assays. At least 48 h after transfection, tsA-201 cells were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer, 10 mM EGTA and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min. To maintain Ca 2+ -dependent interactions, we pretreated some groups with 5 μM A23187 and 2 mM CaCl 2 for 15 min but did not include EGTA in the lysis buffer. The postnuclear supernatant was incubated with 15 μg of α 1 2.1-specific antibodies 39 for 2 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were separated on protein A–Sepharose, resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. For immunoblotting, we blocked nitrocellulose filters for 30 min in 5% milk/TBS and incubated them with the CaBP1 antiserum UW72 or with CNA5-specific antibodies for 1 h. Blots were washed three times in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with horse-radish peroxidase–linked protein A for 40 min. We used ECL western blotting reagent for detection of chemiluminescence. For co-immunoprecipitations from rat brain, we homogenized cerebellar tissue from two adult male rats in 0.3 M sucrose, 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mM EGTA. We included protease inhibitors in the homogenization buffer and in buffers used at all subsequent steps. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 g, and membrane fractions were separated from the postnuclear supernatant at 100,000 g for 30 min. Membrane proteins were solubilized with 4 ml of buffer A and insoluble material was removed by further centrifugation. Ca 2+ channels were immunoprecipitated with 15 μg of CNA5-specific antibodies per ml of solubilized membrane protein. We isolated immune complexes on protein A–Sepharose and detected the associated CaBP1 by immunoblotting as described above. Immunocytochemistry. Anesthetized adult Sprague–Dawley rats were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The brain was post-fixed and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and tissue sections were cut on a sliding microtome in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Tissue sections were rinsed with 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline and blocked sequentially with 2% avidin and 2% biotin. For the double-labeling of CaBP1 and α 1 2.1, we incubated tissue sections in UW72 antiserum for 36 h at 4°C, biotinylated goat antibody against rabbit IgG for 1 h at 37°C, and avidin D–fluorescein for 1 h at 37°C, with rinsing between each step. The tissue was then blocked with 5% normal rabbit serum in TBS for 1 h and incubated with affinity-purified Fab fragments for 1 h at 37°C. After rinsing, tissue sections were incubated with antibodies specific for CNA5 for 36 h at 4°C, biotinylated goat antibody against rabbit IgG for 1 h at 37°C, and avidin D–Texas Red for 1 h at 37°C. Tissue sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, protected with coverslips, and viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 microscope in the W.M. Keck Imaging Facility at the University of Washington. All procedures conformed to protocols approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Washington. Electrophysiology and data analysis. At least 48 h after transfection, tsA-201 cells were incubated with CD8-specific antibody–coated microspheres to permit detection of transfected cells. We recorded whole-cell Ca 2+ currents with a List EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier and filtered them at 5 kHz. Leak and capacitive transients were subtracted using a P/–4 protocol. Extracellular recording solutions were composed of 150 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM CaCl 2 or BaCl 2 ; intracellular solutions were composed of 120 mM N -methyl- d -glucamine, 60 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM Mg-ATP and 0.5 mM EGTA or 10 mM BAPTA. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. The time course of I Ca decay was fit by either A or A slow + A fast, where t is time; A slow and A fast are the amplitudes of the slow and fast exponentials, respectively, at t = 0; and τ slow and τ fast are the time constants of the decay of the two processes. Normalized tail current–voltage curves were fit with a single Boltzmann function: A /, where V is test pulse voltage, V 1/2 is the midpoint of the activation curve, k is a slope factor, A is the amplitude and b is the baseline. Curve fits and data analysis were done with Igor Pro software. All averaged data are the mean ± s.e.m. We determined the statistical significance of differences between groups by Student's t -test.
