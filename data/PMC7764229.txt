 Simple Summary Transposable elements are mobile DNA sequences that can copy themselves within a host genome. TE-mediated changes in regulation can lead to massive and rapid changes in expression, responses that are potentially highly adaptive when an organism is faced with a mortality agent in the environment, such as an insecticide. Helicoverpa armigera shows a hight number of reported cases of insecticide resistance worldwide, having evolved resistance against pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates, organochlorines, and recently to macrocyclic lactone spinosad and several Bacillus thuringiensis toxins. In the present study, we conducted a TE annotation using combined approaches, and the results revealed a total of 8521 TEs, representing 236,132 copies, covering 12.86% of the H. armigera genome. In addition, we underlined TE insertions in defensome genes and we successfully identified nine TE insertions belonging to the RTE, R2, CACTA, Mariner and hAT superfamilies.
