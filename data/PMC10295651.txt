 Simple Summary In this study, we examined the effects of nine DIF derivatives on chemotactic cell movement toward cAMP and compared their chemotaxis-modulating activity and stalk cell differentiationâ€“inducing activity in wild-type and mutant strains in Dictyostelium discoideum. We found that the DIF derivatives differentially affected chemotaxis and stalk cell differentiation, suggesting that DIF-1 and DIF-2 have at least three receptors: one for stalk cell induction and two for chemotaxis modulation.
