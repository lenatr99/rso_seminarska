The roco4- strain has enhanced mitochondrial respiratory activity while the Roco4 G1179S shows decreased mitochondrial respiration compared to the WT strain. Oxygen Consumption Rate measurements were obtained over time using an extracellular flux analyzer. The mitochondrial stress test was used to obtain bioenergetic parameters. The figure shows the OCR values of the D. discoideum strains. The roco4- strain has significantly elevated basal OCR, ATP synthesis rate and complex I activity compared to the WT. The maximum OCR is slightly elevated though not significant. Reduction in the basal and maximum OCR of the Roco4 G1179S strain relative to the WT while the Roco4 rescue cells show reduction only in the maximum OCR compared to the WT cells. All data are represented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed using unpaired t -test for the WT and the roco4- strains and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test or Kruskal–Wallis test for the WT, Roco4 G1179S and Roco4 rescue strains. P -values indicating statistically significant differences between the mean values compared to the WT control and are defined as follows: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001.

Data shown are representative of 10- 11 different wells/condition and the experiment was repeated at least three times with individual LRRK2 parental RAW 264.7 and LRRK2 KO RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. P -values indicating statistically significant differences between the mean values compared to the WT control with ** p < 0.01. Corrected oxygen slope of different mitochondrial respiration states of LRRK2 parental and KO RAW 264.7 cells revealing no significant differences in the mitochondrial respiration states in isolated mitochondrial fraction.
