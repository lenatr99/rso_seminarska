 In order to discover new 31 P NMR markers for probing subtle pH changes in biological environments, fifteen new conformationally constrained or sterically hindered α-aminophosphonates derived from diethylphosphonate were synthesized and tested for their pH reporting and cytotoxic properties in vitro. All compounds showed near-neutral p K a s, chemical shifts not overlapping those of phosphorus metabolites, and spectroscopic sensitivities ranging from 9.2–10.7 ppm, being fourfold larger than conventional endogenous markers such as inorganic phosphate. X-ray crystallographic studies combined with predictive empirical relationships and ab initio calculations addressed the inductive and stereochemical effects of substituents linked to the protonated amine function. Satisfactory correlations were established between p K a s and both the 2D structure and pyramidalization at phosphorus, showing that steric crowding around the phosphorus is crucial for modulating Δ δ ab. Finally, the hit 31 P NMR pH probe 1b bearing an unsubstituted 1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane ring, which is moderately lipophilic, nontoxic on A549 and NHLF cells, and showing p K a = 6.45 with Δ δ ab = 10.64 ppm, allowed the first clear-cut evidence of trans-sarcolemmal pH gradients in normoxic Dictyostelium discoideum cells with an accuracy of <0.05 pH units.

Introduction Intracellular pH is a fundamental physiological parameter whose changes affect nearly all metabolic and growth/proliferation cellular processes, and can also occur in response to exogenous agents. Maintaining pH homeostasis in the cytosol, extracellular milieu and subcellular compartments is crucial for all living organisms. Among the mechanisms of pH i regulation, the Na + /H + antiporter represents a major pathway for the exit of protons from cells during acidification and the entry of Na + from the extracellular medium to balance the net charge movement. Indeed, pH i and pH e are in a dynamic steady state and, in normal mammalian cells, pH i is close to neutrality while pH e is slightly alkaline. Therefore, experimentally assessing pH regulation in pathological situations requires both pH i and pH e to be monitored simultaneously and accurately. Since Moon and Richard’s first report, 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance has become a powerful and non-invasive technique for determining pH i on the basis of the variation of pH, with the chemical shift of endogenous inorganic phosphate. This technique has been applied to a variety of biological systems, e.g., for monitoring bioenergetics and/or the metabolism of various organs. 31 P NMR is also routinely used in the study of food chemistry, quality, and safety control or for monitoring the production of everyday products, to name but a few. Despite P i being ubiquitous in cells, its use as an ‘universal’ 31 P NMR pH sensor in biological studies has, however, many drawbacks that may impair spectroscopic detection. First, given that the absolute value of the chemical shift difference between the protonated acidic and unprotonated basic forms of P i is only ~2.6 ppm, with a p K a ~6.75, it cannot sense pH i /pH e differences of less than 0.3 pH units. Moreover, the fluctuations of P i concentration during metabolism and its low availability in the extracellular space and many organelles considerably hinder direct access to local pH measurements using this probe. Ideally, the structural requirements for improved 31 P NMR pH markers would both involve increasing Δ δ ab as to get pH titration curves with the steepest slope around the p K a value and modulating the p K a value to fine tune extracellular/intracellular pH domains of interest. In order to minimize the possible cytotoxic effects, the first synthetic attempts towards these above conditions focused on modifications around the P i structure to get alkylated phosphonic acids RP 2, which were found to exhibit slightly increased Δ δ ab values and p K a s of 7.0 ± 0.5. To illustrate, the methylphosphonate p K a = 7.36, with Δ δ ab = 3.88 ppm at 20 °C in a Krebs–Henseleit buffer is currently used in organ perfusion experiments. Further targets were α-, β- and γ-substituted linear aminophosphonic acids whose Δ δ ab values, however, did not exceed 3.4 ppm, but showed relatively weak toxicity and had lower p K a s suitable for probing the acidic domains in cells, tumors, and perfused organs. Since in all these above compounds, protonation always occurs at the phosphorus first, it was then speculated that scaffolds bearing a non-ionizable P -atom and a protonable α-amino group would offer considerable advantages in terms of Δ δ ab and p K a modulation due to different inductive and steric effects. This approach led to the development of two families of uncharged pH probes, including cyclic pyrrolidine-based α-aminophosphonates and linear polysubstituded α-aminophosphonates. For all these compounds, it was found that protonation, which gives the ammonium salt as the acidic species, resulted in lower p K a s and gave Δ δ ab values up to fourfold greater than that of P i or phosphonic acids. Thus, the reported pH titration curves for the α-aminophosphonate having the structure shown in Figure 1 D, with afforded Δ δ ab = 10.3 ppm and p K a = 7.01 in KH buffer. Later, the successful mitochondrial targeting of selected compounds shown in Figure 1 D was achieved by grafting a triphenylphosphonium cation, and most of the resulting structures retained the good pH-probing performance of their parent compounds. To illustrate, using a nontoxic micromolar concentration of the triphenylphosphonium bromide having the structure shown in Figure 1 E with, for which Δ δ ab = 10.3 ppm and p K a = 6.99, allowed the first 31 P NMR assessment of acidic and cytosolic mitochondrial compartments of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Figure 1 Families of phosphorylated derivatives used as exogenous 31 P NMR pH probes. Conformationally constrained CyDEPMPHs pH probes. Sterically crowded DEPMPH-derived pH probes. Inset : Structure of DEPMPH... The knowledge of small trans-sarcolemmal pH gradients is one of the most important pieces of dynamic information to be obtained using very sensitive pH probes, especially when the external P i peak is hardly or not detectable. This was addressed in normoxic perfused rat hearts either by 31 P NMR with the cell impermeable phenylphosphonic acid or by 19 F NMR using a fluorinated pyridine derivative, and in these early studies, reachable trans-sarcolemmal gradients were found to be 0.24 and 0.38 pH units, respectively. Based on their significantly larger Δ δ ab s when compared to, e.g., phenylphosphonic acid, many newer 31 P NMR pH probes displayed in Figure 1 C,D could be much better alternatives in probing more subtle pH changes occurring in acidotic cells. Actually, such an improvement was obtained using diethylphosphonate 1a during ischemia of the rat isolated heart or liver. However, despite the given advantage to probe the intra, extra and acidic regions simultaneously, 1a was found to be less accurate than P i for cytosolic pH determination. The line width broadening at pH ≈ p K a impairs any accurate pH determination, therefore excluding probes having a p K a close to the pH region of interest. Moreover, the strictly neutral p K a of 1a was a drawback for assessing accurately the pH variations in acidic compartments. It can therefore be inferred that, besides a Δ δ ab value > 10 ppm, a better differentiation between the intracellular vs. extracellular NMR peaks would demand shifting of the p K a of the probe downwards to, e.g., 6.2–6.8. Previously a semi-empirical linear model was established for predicting the p K a of 1a and derivatives based on their 2D geometries and the additive inductive effect of substituents in β position of the nitrogen. In the present study the DEPMPH pyrrolidine scaffold was used to elaborate novel derivatives in which the P -bound alkoxy groups were either constrained as a 2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospharinane ring or induced steric crowding around the P -atom. Compounds were investigated for their 31 P NMR relaxation properties and pH reporting behavior in vitro. The collected experimental Δ δ ab values and p K a s were found to be consistent inputs to consolidate the empirical relationships of. Additional density functional theory calculations were performed on the pyramidalization angle of compounds 1a – p, pooled with a large series of structurally related compounds. The results, together with structural complements using X-ray structures of those crystallized CyDEPMPHs, established a relationship between pyramidalization around P and Δ δ ab. From the above parameters, experimentally determined cytotoxicities, and calculated lipophilicities, the hit compound 1b was selected and its ability to simultaneously probe the intra, extra and acidic regions was checked in normoxic Dictyostelium discoideum cells. For the first time, a trans-membrane pH gradient with an estimated precision of < 0.05 pH units was found in full accordance with the pH values given by the cytosolic and external P i peaks, suggesting that 1b could be a useful tool in a pathological situation where P i peaks fall below the NMR detection limit. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Chemistry and X-ray Crystallography Aminophosphonates 1a – p were synthesized according to the general sequence outlined in Scheme 1, involving the reaction of the corresponding dialkyl H-phosphonate 2a – p with 2-methyl-1-pyrroline. Starting compounds dialkyl H-phosphonates 2a, 2g, 2i, and 2j are commercially available, while the other precursors 2b – f, h, k – p were synthesized according to with slight modifications. Briefly, H-phosphonic bis was prepared in situ by the addition of one equivalent of water to hexamethylphosphorous triamide in tetrahydrofuran, and then alcohol was added to give the corresponding compounds 2b – f, h, k – p. Reactions were monitored directly by 31 P NMR by following the disappearance of HMPT peak followed by the formation of bisphosphoric acid peak, then by the disappearance of this latter and the formation of the corresponding dialkyl H-phosphonate peak. Dialkyl phosphonates 1a – p were obtained by the nucleophilic addition of dialkyl H-phosphonates 2a – p onto 2-methyl-1-pyrroline in toluene in good yields. Scheme 1 General synthesis of aminophosphonates 1a – p. Reagents and conditions: 1 equiv H 2 O, 3 h, 70 °C, THF; 1 equiv diol, 6 h, 70 °C, THF or 2 equiv alcohol, 3 h, 70 °C, THF;... Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained for the five compounds 1b, trans - 1c, and 1d – f by recrystallization from a dichloromethane: tert -butylmethylether mixture. The pyrroline rings were found to adopt puckered conformations which can be either the E + 4 envelope conformation, the T1 twist conformation or an intermediate situation between the T1 and E + 4 conformations according to the classification of. The C–P bond is pseudo-axial in compounds 1e and 1f and pseudo-equatorial in compounds 1b, trans - 1c, and 1d, as referred to by the sign of the C–N–C–C dihedral angle in nitrones analogues of CyDEPMPHs.

For clarity, H-atoms have been omitted. Table 1 General Structure, Atoms Numbering and Selected X-Ray Crystallographic Data of CyDEPMPHs a. 2.2. pH Dependent 31 P NMR Properties of New α-Aminophosphonates The pH dependence of the 31 P NMR chemical shift of 1a – p was investigated at 22 °C in KH buffer. Monophasic acid–base titration curves reflecting protonation on nitrogen were obtained for all the derivatives and their fitting to the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation in Section 3 ) allowed the calculation of p K a s, the 31 P NMR parameters, and the spin lattice relaxation time. Figure 3 pH Dependence of the 31 P chemical shift of CyDEPMPHs 1b, cis - 1c, and 1e compared to P i. Titrations were performed at 22 °C in a modified KH buffer and each curve was obtained by the nonlinear fitting of 3–10 independent experiments.... Table 2 31 P NMR Parameters and p K a Values a in KH Medium at 22 °C. All the new derivatives fulfilled both the desired conditions for more accurate pH probing, exhibiting near-neutral p K a s and very high Δ δ ab values. Indeed, the average 31 P NMR sensitivities obtained here could compete with those of the best linear aminophosphonates available so far. Interestingly, the compounds having no constrained phosphorus bound alkoxy groups such as 1a and almost all elements from the crowded family showed slightly more basic p K a s and lower 31 P sensitivities when compared to compounds from the CyDEPMPHs family, for which Δ δ ab > 10 ppm. The only exception was compound 1f, which retained a high sensitivity despite Δ δ ab = 9.35 ppm and a p K a value in the range of that of the crowded DEPMPHs. In a biological milieu where NMR peaks are usually broad, any added pH probe should exhibit protonated and non-protonated forms in fast exchange on the NMR timescale to provide a single sharp peak for each cytosolic/intracellular compartment. This implies that the T 1 time of the probe should be as short as possible in order for the best resolved signals to be recorded within the timescale of expected variations of biological parameters, such as pH. All new pH probes demonstrated T 1 values similar to those found in other related aminophosphonates. Expectedly, molecular motion restriction in the conformationally constrained CyDEPMPHs 1b – f versus the long-chain linear phosphonates 1l – p from the crowded series generally resulted in slightly increased T 1 values. It is worth noting that probe exchanges between cell compartments are slow on T 1 and chemical shift NMR timescales, while diffusion kinetics may exhibit strong variations for linear versus cyclic aminophosphonates ). Given that pH i variations in vivo may occur in minutes, T 1 does not therefore appear to be a decisive parameter to discriminate between probes having similar chemical structures. 2.3. pKa Modeling as a Function of Substituents Predicting p K a values by molecular modeling is of paramount importance in the design of improved 31 P NMR pH markers. In this regard, a pertinent approach is to consider the pH-dependent variations of electron density around the protonation site; that is, p K a should depend linearly on the sum of individual inductive and stereochemical contributions of substituents. This has been applied successfully, first to a series of alkylphosphonic acids as depicted in Figure 1 A, second to the cyclic and linear α-aminophosphonates developed in the early 2000s. In these studies, p K a s were computed using the semi-empirical linear model of Equation : p K a = a 0 + ∑ a i × n i where, for a given structurally related family of compounds, a 0 is the p K a of the common parent chemical structure and parameters n i and a i represent the number of each different kind of substituents of type i having the same structure and/or position relative to the nitrogen protonation site and the weight of its electronic effect relative to the p K a value a 0, respectively. Starting from the general dialkylamino structure with up to seven surrounding substituents, a new refinement, including compounds 1a – p, of the previous a i database collected from earlier studies afforded the updated Table S2, where the selected reference structure bears a cycloalkyl substituent. The extended a i database encompassed a total of 59 aminophosphonates, comprising 1a and the new analogues 1b – p, twenty-two linear and ten cyclic aminophosphonates, five aminophosphophonic acid derivatives, and six alkylamines studied previously. As shown in Figure 4, updating the a i values still resulted in a good fit between experimental and calculated p K a s. Figure 4 Correlation between experimental and calculated p K a values for a pooled database of 59 α-aminophosphonates using the updated linear predictive model of Equation. The red circle indicates the p K a domain of new compounds... In the computational p K a s model of Equation, all compounds 1a – p share the same substitution pattern, i.e., one H atom on the nitrogen, two C–H, three alkyls on C and C, and one C–Phosphonate. Having the same set of, compounds 1a – p obviously yielded the same calculated p K a = 6.475, while an experimental range of Δp K a = 0.75 was found. When compared to this common p K a value, the experimental p K a s of the more substituted compounds 1f and 1i were found to be strongly underestimated by 0.315 and 0.495 units, respectively, suggesting that steric factors should be accounted for in the p K a s predictive model. 2.4. Pyramidalization Angle Calculations Previously, electrostatic interactions such as internal + NH 2 ····P hydrogen bonding have been proposed to explain the shielding of the NMR peaks occurring upon protonation of α-aminophosphonates, an effect that would decrease the pyramidalization of the angle of the tetrahedral phosphorylated moiety. In view of the lack of accuracy of the predictive model of Equation for the most sterically hindered new pH probes, it was investigated whether additional conformationally derived effects may be implicated. DFT-B3LYP calculations using the Gaussian16 package were carried out for optimizing angle variations between acidic and basic forms for 1a – p, pooled with the previously studied compounds LAP- 1 – 34, CAP- 1 – 10, and APA- 1 – 7. For this large set of compounds a moderately good linear correlation was obtained between Δ ab and Δ δ ab, confirming that pyramidalization at phosphorus should have a notable impact on the 31 P NMR sensitivity of aminophosphonates. For simplification, the pyramidalization angle α here was defined as the average of the three angles between P–O 1–3 bonds and the p -plane orthogonal to the P–C bond ; that is, α decreases as the pyramid is more flattened. Negative Δ ab variations associated to Δ δ ab < 0 were found for APA- 1 – 6 aminophosphonic derivatives in the p K a2 region of the second acidity. A second group of molecules showed small changes in the pyramidalization angle, associated with low 31 P NMR sensitivities. These latter structures bear at least two carbons between the N and P atoms of the phosphonic derivatives. Figure 5 Plot of 31 P NMR sensitivity against ab initio calculated pyramidalization angles at phosphorus between the acidic and basic forms of a series of phosphorylated pH probes. Circled regions I to III visualize increasing pH probing properties. Proton... As anticipated behind the design of compounds 1b – p, Figure 5 A and Figure 5 B show that those molecules having the largest Δ ab also exhibited the greater Δ δ ab s. Together with 1a – p, region III compounds in Figure 5 A also included the derivatives APA- 1, LAP- 1 – 22, 24 – 34, and CAP- 1 – 10 ; that is, in all these molecules, the environment around P is moderately to strongly sterically crowded. Of interest, among the CyDEPMPHs, the apparently less constrained 1b, which bears a less bulky unsubstituted 1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane ring, demonstrated the highest protonation-induced Δ ab value of 2.10°. 2.5. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies The cytotoxic activities of compounds 1a – p in A549 human lung carcinoma cells and in normal human lung fibroblasts were evaluated in 0.2% DMSO-supplemented Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and fibroblast basal medium, respectively. The methods used included the tetrazolium dye MTT reduction, the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity, and the intracellular ATP assays. The MTT and FMCA assays are standard colorimetric determinations of cell viability during in vitro drug treatment while the ATP assay is an index of metabolic activity. The IC 50 values following 48 h incubation at 37 °C of the cells with varying concentrations of test compounds are reported in Table 3, together with the predicted lipophilicities based on AlogP calculations. When the three above-cited endpoints were found to be affected by treatment with a test compound, the release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase was assessed to check for cell necrosis. Table 3 Cytotoxicity of α-Aminophosphonates Against A549 Cells and Normal Human Lung Fibroblasts a, and their Calculated Lipophilicities. In the supernatant of untreated A549 and NHLF cells, the baseline LDH value was found to be 10.2 ± 1.5 and 11.3 ± 1.9 UI/mg protein, respectively. When compared to the total LDH activity measured after 100% lysis of the cells, which was 690 ± 47 and 701 ± 34 UI/mg protein for A549 and NHLF, respectively, the baseline released LDH vs. total cellular LDH in untreated cells was found to be as low as 1–2%. After 48 h incubation of the cells, no significant dispersion among assays was found with compounds 1b – e of the CyDEPMPHs family, suggesting those aminophosphonates induced cell death by altering metabolic activity, enzymatic and mitochondrial functions rather than by causing membrane damage and/or cell necrosis. The more lipophilic 1d and 1e were found to be slightly more toxic. Regarding the three viability assays, the more lipophilic compound of the CyDEPMPHs family, 1f, was associated with the strongest global decrease of IC 50 values, which was of 42–50% as compared to 1b, and reached 50–60% as compared to 1a. In parallel, the application of 1f resulted in a significant LDH leakage showing it additionally caused cell necrosis. In the crowded family of pH probes, the decrease in viability globally paralleled the increase of lipophilicity, except for 1o and 1p. Hence, IC 50 values for 1j – p decreased by 60–80% as compared to the hydrophilic 1g in the MTT and ATP assays, while an even greater impact was found for these lipophilic compounds in the FMCA assay, suggesting they induced membrane damage at concentrations > 10 mM. Consistently, application of 1j – p to both types of cells resulted in a strong LDH leakage at IC 50 values. Altogether, the cytotoxicity data of Table 3 demonstrated that most of the new pH probes, i.e., 1b – e and 1g – i, could be added safely in cell medium at a concentration window compatible with NMR applications. Due to its innocuity and optimal 31 P NMR titration parameters, compound 1b was considered ideal for probing small pH gradients, since it can be used at 4 mM, a concentration at which >98% cell viability was preserved. 2.6. Application of the 31 P NMR pH Probes 1b vs. 1a in Dictyostelium discoideum Amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used cell model for investigating acidic organelles, has been found to be particularly suitable to monitor by 31 P NMR the kinetics of anoxia- and reoxygenation-induced pH variations in various endosomal acidic vesicles. In the search for improved resonance tools for assessing trans-sarcolemmal pH gradients, i.e., pH i /pH e differences, D. discoideum was also found to be a reliable model, since in this case endogenous and external 31 P NMR P i peaks are easily distinguishable and may allow a direct comparison with the expected resonances arising from the probe, provided it could significantly accumulate within the cytosolic and external compartments. Such properties were not reported in other models, including the rat heart and liver due, among other reasons, to the low and/or varying concentrations of P i, the large line widths of cellular 31 P NMR peaks, and the low pH i /pH e difference < 0.5 pH units. Figure 6 shows representative 31 P NMR spectra obtained during incubation at 20 °C of normoxic amoebae in the presence of 4 mM of 1a or 1b. In the more deshielded spectral region of the experiment with 1b, prominent resonances were apparent, likely arising from the probe internalized in cells and located in three distinct intracellular compartments. From the calibration curve of 1b, the corresponding pH values were calculated as ~5.6 and 6.20 and 7.27 for the lowfield peaks at 25.4 and 29.9 ppm, respectively. These two latter compartments probed by 1b likely correspond to the extracellular and cytosolic environments, in full accordance with the pH values determined by the two P i peaks, pH i ~7.24 and pH e ~6.32. Figure 6 31 P NMR spectra from D. discoideum cells aerobically incubated at 20 °C in the presence of 4 mM of 1b or 1a. The signals correspond to a 15-min accumulation while the cytosolic and extracellular regions exhibited broader lines and higher apparent pH values of pH i 7.57 and pH e ~6.56, respectively. This showed that 1a accumulated mainly in the external space vs. the cytosol and confirmed the previous observations of a line broadening at the resonance corresponding to the cytosolic pH, and a slight alkalinization of the cytosolic and extracellular compartments because of the higher p K a of the probe, which behaved as a weak base. The innocuity of 1b in the system was confirmed by its lack of effect on the endogenous intracellular phosphorylated compounds including nucleotides, inositol hexakisphosphate and phosphomonoesters, as compared to control spectra. As already reported with other series of cyclic and linear α-aminophosphonates, 1b was internalized in amoebae in less than 5 min both in the cytosol, extracellular region and acidic vesicles. To explain the rapid rate of diffusion and intracellular distribution observed for 1b and other aminophosphonates, it was supposed that these compounds are membrane permeable under their unprotonated amine form, and can accumulate by passive diffusion. This general property confers a great advantage to α-aminophosphonates as compared to the commonly used alkylated phosphonic acids derivatives, which were shown to internalize slowly, at least during 90 min, within the cells, involving energy requiring processes such as continuous H + pumping by vacuolar H + –ATPase, leading to NTP depletion. To stress on the specific 31 P NMR pH reporting properties, the biocompatible 1b showed a ~3.2 better potential accuracy than P i. This may allow us to reliably address pH differences as low as 0.05 pH units, corresponding to narrow peaks separated by ~0.25 ppm. As anticipated in the design of the novel pH probes, this property results from their improved Δ δ ab values, giving a steepest slope around p K a s close to that of P i. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Chemistry All reagents and solvents were of the highest grade available from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka, SDS, or Acros, and were used without further purification, except for 2-methyl-1-pyrroline, which was distilled under reduced pressure before use. Diethyl H-phosphonate, dimethyl H-phosphonate, di H-phosphonate, and di- n -butyl H-phosphonate were from Acros. The dialkyl H-phosphonates 2b – f and the aminophosphonates 1b – f belonging to the CyDEPMPHs family were synthesized and purified as previously described. DEPMPH, and its analogue 1i, and dialkyl H-phosphonates 2h and 2n, and aminophosphonates 1g, 1h, and 1n were synthesized and purified as previously described. Reactions were followed by thin layer chromatography on Merck-Kieselgel 60 F254 precoated silica gel plates, and the spots were visualized by staining with phosphomolybdic acid. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVL 300 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to internal tetramethylsilane or external 85% H 3 PO 4, and coupling constants J are given in Hz. The abbreviations s, d, t, m and q refer to singlet, doublet, triplet, multiplet and quartet signals, respectively. Melting points were determined using a B-540 Buchi apparatus and are uncorrected.

P NMR pH-Titration of Aminophosphonates 1a-p All titrations were carried out at 22 °C in modified KH medium, consisting of : KH 2 PO 4, 1.2; MgSO 4, 1.2; NaCl, 118.5; KCl, 4.8; NaHCO 3, 25, and EDTA, 0.55 dissolved in doubly distilled deionized water. Spectra were acquired at 22 °C on a Bruker AMX 400 spectrometer with a 9.4 Tesla wide-bore magnet at a phosphorus frequency of 161.98 MHz. Samples were placed in 10-mm tubes. 2 H 2 O in a small capillary was used as a lock signal for the spectrometer. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with respect to 85% external H 3 PO 4 at 0 ppm and were plotted against pH to fit the Henderson–Hasselbach Equation for NMR using nonlinear regression : p H = p K a + log δ − δ a δ b − δ where δ is the experimental 31 P chemical shift and the δ a and δ b correspond to the limiting chemical shift values of protonated and unprotonated amines forms, respectively. Calculated titration data ) are expressed as mean ± SD. 3.4. Computational Methods for Angle Calculations angle calculations were performed for both acidic and basic forms of the aminophosphonates. To improve the accuracy of the calculations for compounds 1a – p, compounds LAP- 1 – 34, CAP- 1 – 10, APA- 1 – 5, and 6 amines were included to the pooled molecules. The angle calculations were performed using Gaussian16 software after geometry optimization at B3LYP/6-31G level of theory. To obtain the most stable conformation of each molecule before DFT optimization, a simulated annealing calculation at the AM1 level with the Ampac 11 software package was performed. The optimizations were achieved with a maximum time of 12 h. A check for the absence of imaginary frequencies and a gradient close to zero was performed. All calculations were performed in water solvent with the Polarizable Continuum Model. Data are expressed as the differences in angles between the acidic and basic structures. 3.5. Cell Culture, Cytotoxicity Assays, and pH Assessment in Amoebae DMEM, GlutaMax™, and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Gibco Life Technologies Inc.. FBM and growth factors were from Lonza. A549 and NHLF cells were routinely maintained in and, respectively, as described previously. After reaching 90% confluence, cells were harvested for subculture. Cells were trypsinized, seeded in 96-well microplates and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 to reach ~80% confluence in the appropriate medium. The medium was renewed and cells were exposed for 48 h to the tested compounds or DMSO added medium. Afterwards, cells were washed twice with PBS 1X for cytotoxicity analysis. Supernatant medium samples were kept to evaluate cytosolic LDH release using a commercial kit. To estimate the total LDH content, a control measurement was performed for each set of experiments by treating cells with 1% Triton X-100 to induce a total LDH release in the supernatant and induce a 100% loss of viability. The FMCA and MTT assays were carried out as described. Intracellular ATP content was assayed using a luciferin–luciferase reagent ) according to. IC 50 values, defined as the concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% cell viability after 48 h, were calculated from concentration–response curves and are expressed as mean ± SD. 3.6. Dictyostelium Discoideum Cells Cultures and 31 P NMR D. discoideum amoebae, axenic strain, were cultured aerobically as previously described. Briefly, cells were harvested in their exponential growth phase, washed with ice-cold 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid sodium salt buffer and then suspended at 20 °C under O 2 bubbling in MES-Na, 6% 2 H 2 O and 5 µL of Antifoam 289 to a final volume of 20 mL. Afterwards, 1a or 1b were added to the cell medium and incubation was prolonged for up to 30 min at 20 °C. Incubation samples were then placed in 25-mm NMR tubes and an 2 H 2 O sample, placed in a small capillary, was used as a lock signal for the NMR spectrometer. 31 P NMR spectra were routinely recorded during cell incubation at 20 °C on a Bruker AMX 400 spectrometer with a 9.4 T wide-bore magnet at a phosphorus frequency of 161.98 MHz. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with respect to 85% external H 3 PO 4 at 0 ppm and to 50 mM methylene diphosphonate, placed in a capillary and used as an additional standard at 16.4 ppm. Spectral acquisitions were carried out using a 60° pulse width, a 0.28 s acquisition time, a 0.72 s repetition delay, and gated Waltz proton decoupling. Data were stored during 120 min as 300-scan or 900-scan blocks. Gaussian line broadening was applied prior to Fourier transformation. The extracellular and intracellular distribution of the probe was determined by the respective areas of the corresponding resonances. 3.7. Statistics Titration and biological values are expressed as mean ± SD. Differences were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a posteriori Newman–Keuls test. Intergroup differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. 4. Conclusions A novel series of fifteen α-aminophosphonates have been synthesized and screened for their 31 P NMR properties in the probing of subtle pH changes occurring in normal or acidotic cells. The new compounds, obtained in only two or three synthetic steps, showed the following enhanced properties: chemical shifts in the 18–36 ppm range distinct from those of phosphorus metabolites; near-neutral p K a s ; a high NMR sensitivity that can be modulated by adjusting the substituents and steric effects around the phosphorus atom; no cytotoxic effect for most of them in the concentration range used for biological NMR applications ; the ability to penetrate the compartments of interest ; protonated and non-protonated forms in fast exchange on the NMR timescale, thus providing a single signal for each compartment. The hit compound 1b was applied successfully to accurately measure a trans-sarcolemmal pH gradient in D. discoideum. It is believed this aminophosphonate may be widely used to study the proton exchange dynamics between cellular compartments.
